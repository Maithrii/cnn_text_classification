I am delighted to learn that the UK government is to encourage the production of electric cars (Report, 26 November). But there is only a very brief mention of the need for the adequate provision of charge points. My wife and I took delivery of our first electric car, a Nissan Leaf, six months ago. It is our only car. We live in a rural area. We can manage round trips of up to 100 miles easily, relying solely on our domestic charge point for topping up at night.

For longer trips, however, we need to know that there are properly functioning charge points available to enable quick recharges to get us safely home without the anxiety of possibly being stranded on the way back. Unfortunately we regularly find charge points out of order, even in major centres such as Newcastle. On a recent trip to Durham, right on the far edge of our range, we found that the only rapid charge point at an out-of-town park-and-ride centre had been out of order for a long time. If the use of electric cars is to be seriously encouraged, the provision of a good network of readily accessible and reliable charge points has to be given absolute priority.

As a lifelong Rolling Stones fan who fully recognises their genuine respect for the blues and its heritage (Reviews, G2, 25 November), I find it all the more disappointing that their (black) bass player Darryl Jones is not included in band photos and still appears to be treated as a mere hired hand, 23 years after he replaced Bill Wyman.

I remember when my relationship to money changed. I was a freshman college student with a little extra money from my grants and scholarships. Before I knew it, I was eating at the fanciest restaurants in town. This was the beginning of my “treat yo’ self” journey. In my freshman year, I spent at least $3,000 just eating out.

I was raised by a single mother who worked three jobs to provide me and my brothers with everything we needed and most of what we wanted. Growing up, there never was a large focus on financial literacy or prepping for my future. Now, I wish there had been.



I didn’t shop that much but eating out and traveling effectively diminished all my extra funds. Through a tough biomedical course load and a few tough semesters, I was forced to pick up more jobs to make up for the money I lost in scholarships. Towards the end of my college career I was working three jobs, seven days a week. I was knee-deep into my senior year. To say I was overwhelmed is an understatement.

I was exhausted and began to wonder why I worked so hard when I wasn’t seeing any rewards. Something had to change, and I decided that it would be my lifestyle. The treat yo’ self mindset was intoxicating. It felt like I was having a bubble bath with a nice glass of wine every time I swiped my little piece of plastic. I swore I could feel the release of endorphins every time I purchased something.

Soon, I went from eating out lavishly to shopping. I figured that if I was going to spend the money, I might as well be able to look in my closet and see the fruits of my labor. This is where my love affair with clothing and fashion began. I wanted to change my closet up and I took full advantage. As far as I was concerned, I was just getting an early start to the rest of the way I wanted to live my life.

This was also the time that I got my first credit card. It was a Discover because I had very little credit as a college student. At first it was only used for emergencies, but as money dwindled my credit card became my security blanket – always there to catch my newest purchase.

This brings me to the present day. After a tough last two years and a job transition, I was forced to dip into my 401k just to keep afloat. I’m not alone. African Americans are three times more likely to tap into their 401k or retirement plans to meet immediate financial needs.

Currently, I have six credit cards, three of which were attained in the last two years. They range from my old, faithful Discover to a furniture store card, two additional credit cards and two more store cards. My debt has ballooned from a minuscule few hundred dollars to a staggering $15,000+, not including my student loans. My debt has become my dirty little secret.

Now that I’m 25 and wanting to expand educationally, professionally and personally, I find my debt holding me back. Around 72% of black women are the main breadwinners in their households. That’s why I feel now that it is more crucial than ever to get my financial life right, especially if I want to have a family one day.

My current financial situation is preventing me from pursuing my dream of buying and renovating a house, from investing and preparing from the future and stopping me from traveling. I see more and more every day that financial literacy is not just useful but is critical.

I’ve become a member of various financial literacy programs focused on making knowledge and information about budgeting and saving accessible and mainstream. Still, I struggle daily with making positive choices to ensure my financial future. I know that, because this lifestyle habit took years to develop it will also take years to change.

On Saturday domestic gas and electricity supplier GB Energy announced it was ceasing to trade. The move leaves 160,000 customers in limbo. What happens next for them – and rest of us

None of the small “challenger” energy firms that supply gas and electricity actually produce it – instead they buy it on the wholesale market, add a margin, and sell it on to customers, usually via one of the price comparison websites.

Since launching three years ago, GB Energy had been offering some of the cheapest tariffs in order to grab market share. It gathered 160,000 customers relatively quickly.

The problem is that the management were caught out by wholesale prices rises. The company, which Guardian Money had expressed reservations about this time last year, was not forward-buying enough of its energy and was therefore vulnerable to wholesale price rises. Ultimately, it was probably supplying energy to some households for less that it was paying its suppliers.

Many in the industry have been predicting that a small supplier would go bust in exactly this way. It remains to be seen whether any other small suppliers with similar business models will follow suit.

What happens if I am a GB Energy customer?

Nothing yet – your lights and central heating will continue to come on as if nothing had happened. Behind the scenes, the energy regulator Ofgem is currently in negotiations to appoint what is known as a “supplier of last resort”, a company to which all GB Energy’s customers will be moved en-mass, probably sometime next week.

Last month the regulator rather fortuitously announced it had put in place a safety net to guarantee that any customer who had built up a big credit balance with their supplier won’t lose out.

Domestic energy customers can often be hundreds of pounds in credit at this time of the year, ahead of the peak winter usage period when bills are much higher. Ofgem is looking to appoint a supplier that will in effect honour any credit that GB Energy customers have built up – in return for effectively scooping 160,000 customers.

This looks a tall order given the liability – if half its customers were £300 in credit this equates to £24m. If no supplier will take on the liability, then a levy will be placed on all suppliers to fund this sum, equal to around £1 a household.

Affected GB Energy customers who have not yet taken meter readings should do so. Ofgem will manage the transfer behind the scenes, and has confirmed that no customer will lose out as a result of this.

Almost certainly. The deal to which GB customers will be moved is unlikely to be one of the cheapest on the market. Most likely it will be on the chosen energy supplier’s standard tariff, which typically cost around £1,100 a year for average consumption – around £250 a year more than the cheapest deals out there.

There is nothing to stop customers then moving supplier from Ofgem’s chosen firm, but the advice is to wait until the “last resort” switch has taken place, particularly if you have a credit balance as you could lose that by switching directly now.

I’m with a small supplier – is mine at risk?

It could be. The challenger suppliers do well when wholesale prices fall, but struggle when the opposite happens. The last supplier to go bust was Energy4Business, which collapsed in 2008. In the past few years wholesales prices have been on the side of the small suppliers, but over the past 12 months they have gone up around 50%, albeit from a very low base, and there will be some very nervous finance directors at a number of smaller suppliers this morning.

Seasoned industry expert Doug Stewart, who runs supplier Green Energy UK, says he fears the collapse could be the first of many, if there is a harsh winter. “The closure of GB Energy is as a result of loss-making tariffs coming home to roost. You can’t make losses without having cash to cover them, and when that cash is coming from upfront payments made by customers, the whole pack of cards comes tumbling down when growth slows or stops. There’s nothing left in the bank to pay the creditors, and the customers’ money is all gone,” he says.

Technically there is no reason to avoid the challenger suppliers, as if yours goes bust, you as a consumer won’t lose out. That said, lots of switching households will be even less keen now to switch to a firm they have never heard of. The cheapest current average dual fuel deals cost around £850, but few buyers will have heard of the suppliers.

With the cheapest big six supplier tariffs now costing around £880-£890, many buyers will decide that the extra cost of moving to an established firm could be worth paying.

Steve Webb, pensions minister in the coalition government between 2010-15, says documents produced by the Department of Work and Pensions suggest the government is preparing a “more aggressive” timetable on state pension age changes.

It is a sad fact of office life that the high point of the working day, second only to the utterly glorious bit where you get to go home, is lunch. Somehow a morning of meetings and pointless paperwork can seem almost worth it for a few minutes alone with your Tupperware, quietly going through your ex’s tasteless wedding photos – until a box of fried chicken or a Lean Cuisine curry wafts past, spoiling your gastronomic moment with the all-pervading scent of complete and unabashed rudeness. Eating smelly food at your desk is tantamount to sticking two greasy fingers up at your co-workers – and then wiping them clean on their mouse mats.

Two-thirds of Britons now eat our lunches “al desko” (a phrase that makes this statistic all the more depressing, somehow) most days of the week and, according to a recent survey for the interior landscaping firm Ambius (which may, I suspect, have an interest in redesigning our working environment), half of office workers judge colleagues who choose particularly aromatic food as antisocial. It’s hard not to see this as having a negative effect on productivity – if you’re still boiling with rage at someone for that sardine curry, you’re hardly going to bust a gut to meet their sales targets for the afternoon, or go the extra mile to help them out on an urgent project.

Caroline Craig and Sophie Missing, authors of the definitive guide to the office feast, the Little Book of Lunch, agree smelly food is a problem: “In every office, there is always at least one employee who flouts the staffroom etiquette and microwaves something so pungent, it permeates the whole building’s vents for hours.” However, they acknowledge that sometimes smelly packed lunches are unavoidable – “so if you’ve got smoked haddock chowder to heat up, then for God’s sake do it quickly, then eat it outside on a park bench”.

Not all foods are created equally offensive, of course; hot food smells more strongly, and smelly food that you can hear being slurped or crunched supplies a double whammy of queasy irritation. So where does your lunch come in the hierarachy of shame?

The worst. Even if you close your eyes and breathe through your mouth, you can still hear this lot being consumed through the simmering sound of your own rage. Enjoy only if you’re planning to resign in the next half hour: onion soup (slurp), cheesy chilli nachos (crunch), instant noodles (ugh), garlic bread (basically a P45 in baguette form).

Heat causes molecules in food to move around faster, which means more of them will reach your nose. Best consumed outside in a wide open space: curry of any variety, any brassicas (school dinner alert), fast food, fish, particularly oily fish such as kippers, which could land you in a tribunal.

Enjoy with the window wide open, and only if your deskmate is listening to loud metal over headphones: cheese and onion crisps, crusty tuna rolls, any hipster sandwiches containing kimchi.

Best saved for when the rest of your team has popped to the shops: tuna salad, ripe brie sandwiches, hard-boiled eggs, tinned fish.

Eat when your deskmate is busy on the phone: apples, carrot sticks, ready-salted crisps, nuts, crunchy salads.

Eat as much as you like, when you like: chocolate bars, yoghurt, cucumber sandwiches.

Huge numbers of VAT fraudsters are illegally selling goods tax-free to British shoppers on Amazon and eBay this Christmas, despite new government efforts to crack down on this ballooning £1bn VAT evasion crisis.

A Guardian investigation found a wide variety of popular goods being illegally sold without VAT on Britain’s leading shopping sites. They range from cheap Christmas tree lights, electric toothbrushes and thermal socks to expensive laptops, iPads, music keyboards, violins and pingpong tables.

In some cases, VAT fraudsters offer unbeatable prices. Mostly, however, their prices remain in line with law-abiding competitors and the proceeds of evasion disappear overseas, often to China.

Guardian investigations found many tax-evading sellers were trading without displaying VAT numbers on Amazon or eBay. Others were showing made up numbers, or numbers cloned, without authorisation, from unsuspecting legitimate businesses.

Several sellers purported to be operating through UK trading companies, but checks showed these firms had been dissolved, sometimes years earlier. None responded to questions about VAT.

HMRC estimates the explosion in VAT fraud on Britain’s shopping websites will cost £1bn to £1.5bn in lost VAT revenues this year, with much of it going missing in the current festive period.

By the end of “Cyber Monday”. UK shoppers will have spent £6.77bn on the web in a seven-day shopping binge that peaked on Black Friday, according to online retail association IMRG. The number of parcels ordered online will be up 12% on last year, it estimates.

The market for many goods is now dominated by overseas sellers. On eBay, for example, 40% of UK sales of Android phones are to firms registered in China. Meanwhile, Chinese-based companies account for more than 60% of sales of Christmas tree fairy lights on eBay.co.uk.

There is no suggestion that Amazon or eBay have themselves evaded tax, but critics claim they could make some basic changes – such as requiring sellers to display valid VAT numbers – that would help to stop their websites being used by many overseas companies as a platform for industrial-scale fraud.

Both eBay and Amazon insist that it is not their responsibility to police tax compliance among sellers. VAT rules are complex but the tax generally applies to most goods supplied from locations in the UK even if the seller company is incorporated overseas. Shoppers typically see prices that include VAT, charged on most goods at the standard rate of 20%.

Amazon told the Guardian: “Marketplace sellers are independent businesses responsible for complying with their own VAT obligations.” It added that Amazon does offer tools sellers can use to help with tax compliance, but “we don’t have the authority to review their tax affairs”.

EBay said it would pass information from the Guardian’s investigation to HMRC: “If we are informed by HMRC that a seller is not complying with requirements then we will take appropriate action.” A spokesperson said eBay “continually reminds” sellers of their need to comply with the law and had recently warned overseas firms of the UK government’s efforts to deal with VAT fraud.

After the Guardian first highlighted rife VAT evasion on online shopping sites, HMRC launched a series of warehouse raids, seizing £500,000 of goods. Months later, the then chancellor George Osborne gave tax inspectors new powers which he said demonstrated “firm action to protect the UK market from unfair online competition [from overseas VAT evaders]”.

Under the new rules, HMRC now has the power to issue Amazon and eBay with warning notices about suspected VAT fraudsters using their sites. If they then fail to take action, Amazon and eBay can be held liable for any VAT that later goes missing.

In reality, however, these changes have had little impact and VAT evasion remains widespread. A spokesperson for VATfraud.org, a campaign group set up by UK-based sellers, said: “Despite the new laws, HMRC have shown a woeful lack of action. There are many fraudsters who were reported to HMRC years ago but are still trading, and evading VAT, today.”

Guardian investigations found Amazon even offering extensive support services at its British warehouses to overseas sellers that were doing little to mask their VAT evasion.

As well as advertising these sellers’ goods on Amazon.co.uk, it holds items in Amazon UK warehouses, arranges delivery to addresses across Britain, and deals with complaints and returned goods.

Amazon warehouse staff even offer gift-wrapping services on behalf of the fraudster sellers.

There is no suggestion Amazon or eBay knowingly facilitate specific fraudulent VAT-free sales, but the two US groups are nevertheless well aware that evasion in online shopping is a major problem.

Meanwhile, the sellers themselves are often based overseas, with little or nothing known about their UK sales activities by HMRC.

One such seller, a company based in Dubai, offered an iPad Air 2 for sale on Amazon.co.uk.



The iPad was sold at £456.68, which was a similar price to that on offer at Apple’s own online store. However, the Apple store price included a £78.17 VAT charge while the Dubai-based Amazon seller charged no VAT at all.

Asked for a VAT receipt, the iPad seller said in an email: “We don’t supply UK VAT receipt, sorry.”

Many sellers contacted by the Guardian were similarly open about not charging VAT. “Thank you for your letter and sorry to tell you we do not have UK VAT receipt. We are located in China,” said one. “Our VAT is still in the application,” said another.

A third seller even offered to cut a deal, offering to share part of the proceeds of the VAT fraud. “If you want the VAT receipt, it will be after your purchase a week later. Otherwise, we will offer some discount to you directly,” the seller said in an email. “Looking forward to your reply.”

A former director of an NHS trust is suing Jeremy Hunt for religious discrimination after he was effectively barred from applying for positions following his public opposition to gay adoption.

Richard Page has lodged a claim at the employment tribunal, saying his televised comments in 2015 that it was in the best interests of a child to have a mother and father stemmed from his Christian faith.



His remarks led to him being sacked as a magistrate in March for serious misconduct, after 15 years on the bench. Two years earlier, the lord chancellor and lord chief justice reprimanded Page after finding his religious beliefs, rather than evidence, had influenced his decisions during a family court hearing.



Page, 70, was also a non-executive director at the Kent and Medway NHS and social care partnership trust. In March, following a complaint by the trust’s LGBT staff network, Page was suspended for the final three months of his four-year term in office.



In August, the NHS Termination of Appointments Panel told Page “it was not in the interests of the health service for you to serve as a non-executive director in the NHS”, in effect barring him from applying for directorships in the future.



Page, a former NHS manager from Headcorn, Kent, is bringing a claim against the health secretary and NHS Improvement, which has the power to appoint non-executive directors. He is pursuing a similar case against the lord chancellor over his sacking as a magistrate.



In a TV debate on Christians in public life in March 2015, Page said: “My responsibility as a magistrate, as I saw it, was to do what I considered best for the child, and my feeling was therefore that it would be better if it was a man and woman who were the adopted parents.”



In a video on the website of Christian Concern, which is backing his case, Page denied he was homophobic and claimed that more than 6,500 emails had been sent to the Kent NHS trust in his support against one complaint “from the LGBT people”.



He said: “This is the second public sector organisation that has got rid of me. This, I feel, is completely wrong because it’s discriminatory against my opinions and the fact I was doing what I considered to be right.



“The political correctness makes people be frightened, or makes them think they’re the only ones that believe this way, and yet they obviously are the majority … There are people standing up against the so-called politically correct views.”



Andrea Minichiello Williams, of Christian Concern, said freedoms in the UK were being “catastrophically eroded by political correctness and fear”.



“The comment that a child needs a mother and a father is a belief held by Christians, and many others around the world. Everything that Richard Page does, his whole belief system is rooted in his Christian faith. Beliefs arising from the Christian faith continue to be lawful beliefs in our country.”



She said government assurances that equality legislation would not lead to the removal of people who expressed Christian views while holding public positions had turned out to be baseless.



“If it is possible to suffer the detriment of losing your position at work for expressing lawful Christian views, the situation is crucial. There is, in effect, a religious bar to office for Christians solely; those politically correct institutions would not do the same to other faiths.”



A spokesperson for NHS Improvement said: “We are unable to comment on ongoing court cases.”

There is a popular misconception that becoming a landlord is purely a monetary decision, complemented by the myth that the only task involved is counting the never-ending flow of money, then deciding how to spend or hoard it. My decision to move into this profession was driven by a number of factors, none of which related to it being a supposedly lucrative occupation.

I bailed out of the business world at the relatively young age of 30 after one too many conflicts, my fiery temperament and straight-talking approach ruffling more than a few feathers. However, each job move during my short and turbulent career had created a small pot of severance pay and in the pre-bubble days of the London property market this was sufficient to put down a deposit each time and build up a small portfolio.

Working for myself, managing a portfolio without the need to consult others and play politics, turned out to be much better suited to my personality. I like the challenge of being CEO, marketing director, construction manager, interior designer, concierge, and yes, general dogsbody, all at once. It’s simplistic to look at the wealth I have created and think I have ruthlessly accumulated without consideration for others. But with no pension to speak of and the desire to provide for my children, I am proud to have this business to safeguard our futures.

However, the real passion that inspired me to enter a business that is much tougher than most imagine, is a love of period properties. I have no idea where it came from, but the moment I see a house with intricate mouldings, parquet floors or other character features, my heart starts to race just thinking about how it could look once restored. Typically, a single project takes 18 months from start to finish – and many, many sleepless nights.

Inspiring as it has been to have an interesting niche, the day-to-day work is often highly repetitive, with all too frequent peaks of stress. For every hour consumed with choosing a new sofa, vintage rug, or flicking through an interior design magazine, there are 30 spent dealing with an endless stream of leaking showers, malfunctioning boilers, blocked gutters, not to mention moaning tenants, reluctant builders, arrogant architects and tedious government regulations. Invariably, a crisis appears in the most inopportune moments – there is rarely such a thing as a weekend off.

It is understandable to see tenants as powerless victims, subject to the whims of their landlord’s commercial agenda, but it can and does cut both ways. Most tenants are genuinely decent people and simply want a nice place to live, but as in all walks of life some are capricious, irresponsible and even blatantly dishonest.

Illegal sub-lettings are a constant bane. Serious maintenance problems have built up over months then are casually mentioned in passing in a belated monosyllabic communication. In 25 years I can count on one hand the number of times a tenant has confessed willingly to property damage and offered to pay or fix it. Many wish to instantly break contracts when it is no longer convenient for them to live there.

A tenant’s failure to pay rent is usually a rare occurrence, but when it does happen it’s crucial to treat the problem sensitively rather than instantly reach for the lawyer’s phone number. There is often a personal or economic problem causing the arrears and once this is understood a solution can usually be found. One tenant who had been renting from me for five years lost their job and started drinking heavily. I found out that they had borrowed substantially to finance several months’ rent while out of work. The situation could not go on. We chatted extensively and through a combination of a rent moratorium, shortening of the contract and the promise of an excellent reference, an amicable solution was found.

It would be hypocritical of me not to sometimes feel a twinge of guilt owning numerous properties while a younger generation struggles to get their foot on the ladder. However, building up the portfolio has been my life’s work and I have poured a huge amount of time, energy, passion and money into it – a process which never stops. A vibrant city economy such as London needs a good quality stock of rental properties to meet its citizens’ frequently changing circumstances. It does frustrate me hugely reading about “slum” landlords with their ruthless commercial practices, or speculative buy-to-let investors gobbling up soulless new builds furnished with cheap cookie-cutter interiors for maximum commercial gain. I have to accept that it is part of the business I am in to be tarred with the same brush.

Controversial as Airbnb and its counterparts are, they are a game-changer that is here to stay. I branched out into more short-term arrangements three years ago. Even the best long-term tenant gets a little jaded after a while in the treatment of your properties, so it has been a breath of fresh air dealing with guests who are genuinely thrilled to rent from your portfolio. The other plus is that with shorter rental periods, the bad guests usually leave before they have time to do much damage.

Such short-term lets have been criticised as some kind of cash cow but the amount of work involved in even a single rental is breathtaking. The property maintenance and cleaning has to compete with a five-star hotel and you are in constant touch with guests at all times of the day and night. Fail in any of this and your rating plummets and the property will sink without trace on the listings. You habitually feel like an insecure, over-sensitive actor as you pore over the latest review.

It has also created interesting new scenarios with some bookings not quite what they seem. With the elegant period-style interiors I utilise, the temptation to rent them for more salubrious motives is too much for some guests. One of my first bookings comprised of five guests doing a photoshoot for a magazine. Although I politely requested “no porn” prior to booking, a pretty model proceeded to run around the patio of the building wearing only lingerie, to the delight of the elderly residents.

Others have surreptitiously used my properties for commercial purposes, paying a fraction of the commercial rate of an official location. It is a cat-and-mouse game trying to spot them. However the majority of guests are lovely and have allowed me to recover a sense of pride in what I do, given all the negative publicity frequently surrounding landlords. The schadenfreude from giving overpriced, bland corporate hotel chains a kick in the teeth is an added plus.

As I sit in my home office at 7am and deal with a leaking shower tray in an Edwardian house for the eighth time in nine years, it is easy to fantasise about a profession with less daily drudgery and more stability. It can also be wearying being responsible for the accommodation for typically 20 people every day and night, 365 days of the year. But as a new booking comes in from Beijing or Berlin, or the photos arrive from a recently executed renovation, a surge of adrenalin kicks in and I am ready to face the day’s challenges.

A couple of years ago my husband and I were travelling in south-east Asia, and a Filipino family welcomed us into their humble home and we had an amazing time getting to know them.

Fast forward to last month and I’d sent the children a large parcel of books, toys, art supplies and clothes, worth around £100. I used Parcel Monkey – big mistake! The parcel arrived in the country, but the courier then sent an email to say there was a customs charge and the item would be returned to the UK in three days unless paid. It couldn’t tell me how much it was, so I asked them not to return it while I sorted out any payment due. I emailed the family who said the charge was around £20, which they couldn’t afford, so I immediately sent them the money via Western Union.

When they went to pay, however, the parcel had already been sent back to the UK. Parcel Monkey is refusing to resend the item or refund me the £101.02 it cost to send in the first place. It was a gift for people who are very poor and were so looking forward to it.

Parcel Monkey did not respond to my message about holding the parcel, while its online support is a joke and each time someone different fobs me off. AW, Colchester, Essex

Parcel Monkey is an agency, meaning its business model involves sub-contracting out to local courier companies – customers are invited to choose which one – but over which it has no direct control. Delays with customs, meawhile, can extend predicted deadlines.

The company confirmed that the return of the parcel to the UK was due to unpaid customs duty in the Philippines. DHL (the actual courier company) attempted collection of the duty, but as this was refused by the receiver the item was returned.

A Parcel Monkey spokesman said that both it and DHL had acted in good faith, but he understood why you felt frustrated by events “beyond our control”. He went on: “We, or the carrier selected by our customers, do not have control over international customs and if the time frames are not met, items will be returned. I can confirm that we will return the item back to AW at our own expense as a gesture of goodwill.”

Thankfully this happened, and you reshipped the item directly with DHL.

Alex spent £675 on a washing machine and a fridge-freezer from Littlewoods, opting to “buy now pay later”. At the time his income was sufficient to make the repayments before the end of the interest-free period, but when he was suddenly made redundant he couldn’t afford to repay the debt in time, and then an interest rate of 39% kicked in.

“Suddenly the payments went up from about £130 to £250 a month and I didn’t have the cash,” he says. “Buy now pay later seemed the easy option, but looking back I should have just saved up the money for a couple of months. It was naivety on my part.”

Alex sought advice from debt charity StepChange, and with its help reached an agreement with Littlewoods. In total he repaid £1,130, nearly twice the amount he borrowed. “I will never have a catalogue debt again,” he says, “If I want something I’ll save up for it.”

Alex’s difficulties were compounded by the fact that interest rates on goods bought from catalogues tend to be higher than those on mainstream credit. At this time of year it can be tempting to use these firms to buy Christmas gifts, but finance experts warn that if you’re not going to pay off your borrowing quickly, you could end up paying a high price.

Traditional catalogues such as Freemans and Littlewoods have been around for decades. They allowed customers to shop at home and spread the cost with a range of payment options. The rise of the internet means these brands now operate online, and have been joined by a host of catalogue-style firms selling clothes, gadgets, gifts and furniture.

The catalogue companies typically offer customers incentives to open “personal accounts” with a discount off their first order or free delivery. Account holders are then offered various options to spread the cost of their purchases. Recently, comparison website Money.co.uk described the cost of catalogue credit from some suppliers as “clear as mud”. It warned that in some cases catalogues were charging three times the typical credit card APR of 22.8%.

Among the biggest firms, Very.co.uk charges a typical interest rate of 39.9%; JD Williams (which owns Jacamo, SimplyBe, Fifty Plus, and others) 58.7%; Studio 48.9%; Look Again (owners of Kaleidoscope, Witt International and Curvissa) 34.9%; and Argos 29.9%.

“Buy now pay later”, or BNPL, is a common option. Borrowers who pay the entire bill within the stipulated timescale, normally three, six or 12 months, pay no interest at all. Managed well, this can be a great way to borrow. But if your personal circumstances change and you run into problems, or you just miss a payment, it can cost you dear. If you fail to pay off your borrowing in time the interest is usually backdated to day one – not the date the interest-free period ended.

Headteacher Jacquie Sainsbury recently learned this the hard way. She has been a Very customer for five years, always making her repayments before interest kicked in. However, when she recently attempted to settle a £1,621 balance a power cut meant her debit card payment wasn’t processed and she missed the deadline. Very charges a typical APR of 39.9%, and interest at this rate – £644 – was applied to her account. She asked Very for leniency given that she had tried to make the payment, but the matter is yet to be resolved.

A spokesperson for Shop Direct, which owns Very, says: “Our BNPL options, at terms of six, nine or 12 months, allow customers to budget by making payments of any amount at any time to suit them, and avoid interest by paying the full cash price of the item before the end of the BNPL period. The APRs we offer are competitive, and are based on customers’ individual circumstances and their credit risk profiles.”

Very also offers “low monthly payments” as an option, allowing customers to “take as long as they like” by paying the minimum each month: £5 or 7% of their account balance. But a customer doing this would take five-and-half years to repay a £500 debt, paying £314 in interest in the process. Paying £100 a month instead of the minimum would mean the debt was repaid in six months, with an interest bill of £48.

In comparison, if you borrowed £500 on a mainstream credit card charging 18.29% and repaid £100 a month, you’d pay just £23 in interest over six months.

Jane Tully, director of external affairs at the Money Advice Trust, says the wording “take as long as you like” sends entirely the wrong message. “It could lead to customers paying a large amount of interest, even on a relatively small debt. This language should be changed as a matter of urgency.”

The trust is one of several debt charities warning about the high cost of catalogue debt. Its research shows an estimated 1.9 million people used catalogue credit to buy Christmas presents in 2015. About one in 10 callers to the National Debtline, the charity’s free advice service, have problems with catalogue debt.

Shop Direct also owns Littlewoods. Its customers can “spread the cost” with at least 20 weeks’ interest-free borrowing. After that interest kicks in, although the Littlewoods website doesn’t display the representative rate. A spokesperson told The Observer that the rate depends on the individual customer’s circumstances, but that only a minority choose to arrange their repayments so that they attract interest. “The majority pay the full cash price before the interest opt-out period is over. The most common rate of interest for those that do pay interest on BNPL transactions is 44.9%.”

Grattan was the only company The Observer came across that provided a worked example of the cost implications of not repaying a BNPL deal in time. It states: “Failure to pay a £200 debt in 12 months incurs an interest charge of £60.69, and the new balance of £260.69 then incurs interest at a typical rate of 34.9% until repaid.”

Andrew Hagger of financial website MoneyComms says many people wouldn’t buy things from catalogues if they were aware of the potential cost. “Because the interest charges are applied over multiple weeks or months, the customer loses track of how much they are actually paying back,” he says. “Much like payday loans and credit builder-type credit cards, the interest rates are high because the default rates and non-payment issues are more common than with mainstream credit.”

StepChange says 36% of its clients have catalogue debt, with the average amount owed standing at more than £2,000 – and rising. “Catalogue credit can be an extremely expensive way to shop if people cannot afford to pay it off quickly or they miss payments,” says spokesman Edward Ware. “People need to think carefully about whether credit is the right option for their shopping, before searching for the best deal and deciding whether they can afford to pay off the balance before interest starts to mount up.”

If you fall behind on catalogue repayments, don’t stick your head in the sand. It’s vital to get in touch with your creditors and explain your situation. A debt adviser can help you work out a payment based on a pro-rata distribution of your available income – this means you offer all your creditors a fair share of what you can afford to pay. You can also ask for any interest and charges to be frozen.

Twice a week we publish problems that will feature in a forthcoming Dear Jeremy advice column in the Saturday Guardian so that readers can offer their own advice and suggestions. We then print the best of your comments alongside Jeremy’s own insights.

I work as a European grants manager. My position, although probably OK for the next couple of years, doesn’t have a future in post-Brexit Britain. To add to this, I don’t particularly enjoy the job and it isn’t a career I would have chosen. I did an arts degree and took temping work in the public sector to pay the bills alongside the unpaid or poorly paid work I was doing for a small theatre company.

Nearly 10 years later, I feel stuck in this line of work but my field is drying up fast and will probably end as our ties with the EU are severed. Along the way, I have had experience in project management, financial planning, communication, training, events and marketing, but transferable skills seem to be a thing of the past and the creative sector I long to work in seems to be a tightly guarded door.

Taking a pay cut isn’t viable with my current mortgage payments and although I have looked into getting some career coaching, the costs are out of my reach and the results seem to be hit and miss.

Do you need advice on a work issue? For Jeremy’s and readers’ help, send a brief email to dear.jeremy@theguardian.com. Please note that he is unable to answer questions of a legal nature or to reply personally.

Rail passengers could be given a boost under government plans to make it clearer which is the cheapest ticket option available to them.

Ministers are planning an overhaul of the complex train ticketing system, under which many passengers end up paying more than is necessary for their travel. It is understood that rail firms face being ordered to redesign thousands of station ticket machines as part of the measures, which are due to be announced next month.

“Rail passengers must be able to trust that they are getting the best possible deal every time they travel and we are working with industry partners and consumer experts to identify improvements which could be brought in quickly across the network,” said the Department for Transport (DfT).

“We want a simpler, more modern and passenger-focused fares and ticketing system which takes advantage of all the benefits of new technology. Progress has been made, including an announcement earlier this week of £80m to accelerate the roll-out of smart ticketing across the network.”



It is understood that ministers are considering forcing rail operators to alert passengers who are using station ticket machines or buying from the ticket office if there is a cheaper way to make their journey.

Under the ticketing settlement agreement of 1995, train operators are only obliged to tell customers of the most suitable ticket for their journey.

A source indicated that the government was believed to be planning to order firms to be more consistent on conditions, such as peak time restrictions, attached to tickets.

According to the Times, passengers travelling between London and Birmingham are offered more than 40 different fares and there are an estimated 16m different train fares available on the UK’s rail network.

The paper reported that different self-service machines inside the same train station offer vastly different fares for the same journey, meaning some passengers end up paying more.



Stephen Joseph, executive director of the Campaign for Better Transport, told the paper: “There are 16m fares on the national rail database … anything that makes the system more transparent is very welcome, but this must go further and look at the real fundamentals of the ticketing system.”

A spokesman for the Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators, said: “We want rail customers to get the best possible deal every time. We’re making it easier and quicker for people to pay to travel by train with smarter ticketing, and we want to speed up improvements that will mean simpler, clearer fares that people can trust.”

The government may be preparing to increase the official state pension age to 70 for millions of people currently in their 20s, a former minister has claimed.

Steve Webb said documents produced by the Department for Work and Pensions suggested a “more aggressive” timetable on state pension age (SPA) increases than previously planned was being prepared. 



This could affect tens of millions of workers aged under 55, and bring a pension age of 70 into the official timetable for the first time for people currently aged between 22 and 30, he added. The current official SPA for people in their 20s is 68, though under the existing schedule it could be expected to rise to 69.



The SPA is the earliest age someone can start receiving their state pension, and is due to rise to 66 between 2018 and 2020, to 67 between 2026 and 2028, and then to 68 between 2044 and 2046.



An official review is taking place into the future of the state pension, and on 16 November the DWP asked the Government Actuary’s Department (GAD) to look at projected life expectancy in future years. It wants the department to set out a schedule for SPA increases, assuming the government sticks to its previously-announced policy that people should spend two-thirds of their adult life in work and one third (33.3%) in retirement.



But the DWP also requested figures for people spending 32% of their adult life in retirement. The DWP said this “reflects the experiences of those reaching state pension age over the last 20 years”, but Webb said this failed to take account of more recent improvements in longevity. He said that asking for figures based on 32% was an “unexpected move”.



The move pushes out the age at which the SPA can be paid out, according to analysts by pension consultancy firm Willis Towers Watson.

Webb, a former pensions minister who is now director of policy at mutual insurer Royal London, said: “The previous policy strikes a fair balance between expecting people to work longer and allowing people to enjoy a decent retirement.”

“If the government is planning to force tens of millions of people to work to 68, 69 or even 70, then it should be transparent about its plans. This would be a huge shift and should be properly debated, not buried in a technical document seen only by specialists,” said Webb.

Willis Towers Watson looked at what switching from the existing 33.3% formula to 32% would mean for the SPA, using official life expectancy projections. It said people born between March 1962 and April 1972 would see their pension age rise from 67 now to 68. Meanwhile, those born between March 1973 and April 1985 would have a pension age of 69 rather than the present 68. Those born between March 1986 and April 1994 would see their SPA rise from an assumed 69 to 70.



A DWP spokesperson said: “This work forms part of our research ahead of the first state pension age review. It’s important we have a clear understanding of how the current system is working for pensioners before we undertake the review.”

Willis Towers Watson said that if the decision had to be about how to take money off the public rather than whether to do so, “later retirement may appear more palatable than higher tax rates for (often) the same people”.

It added: “Later working can boost economic output and tax revenues, too. There was barely a squeak of protest when the government announced that the SPA would reach 67 in 2028.”



Possible future changes to state pension entitlements were hinted at by the chancellor, Philip Hammond, in his autumn statement when he said: “As we look ahead to the next parliament, we will need to ensure we tackle the challenges of rising longevity and fiscal sustainability.”



There are also fears that the government will water down the state pension “triple lock”, which means that the payments rise in line which ever is the highest of average wages, inflation, or 2.5%. Damian Green, the minister responsible for pensions, did not guarantee this mechanism would remain during an interview on ITV’s Preston on Sunday, saying it was “premature” to decide on its future. “We’ll need to see what happens to the economy between now and 2020, apart from anything else,” Green said.

The boss of the Institute of Directors will on Monday warn top bosses that the vote for Brexit and the election of Donald Trump will result in greater scrutiny of boardroom behaviour and executive pay.

Simon Walker will tell an audience in London it would be foolish for senior executives to attempt to defend high pay and that, unless they can show they are listening to public concern, the government will do it for them by clamping down on excess.

“Unless boards show that they are listening, and responding, to the mood of the times, the government’s trigger finger will just get itchier and itchier,” he will say.

“At this point the need for change is a pragmatic, even more than a moral one. I am not talking about hand-wringing or words of contrition, I am talking about corporate awareness actually tempering remuneration decisions.”

The speech to the High Pay Centre – in which he will highlight the rise of “superstar CEOs” – comes as Theresa May’s government prepares to publish a green paper on corporate governance, which was one of her key speeches in her successful campaign to become Conservative leader in the wake of the Brexit vote.

The pay of FTSE 100 bosses has rocketed from an average of £1m in 1998 to £4.3m in 2015, far outstripping growth in average pay.

Last week, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) thinktank issued a warning that workers in Britain face the longest squeeze on their earnings for 70 years. The IFS calculated that by 2021, real wages in the UK – pay adjusted for inflation – will still not have recovered to their 2008 level, before the global financial crisis hit.



Walker is expected to say: “After Brexit and Trump, business should expect a new level of scrutiny and questioning of their role in society. It would be foolish now for companies to close ranks and defend the high pay status quo.

“How they react on that issue may prove to be the litmus test for the relationship between business and government over the next few, rather bumpy, years.

“The seeming inevitability of executive pay rises at listed companies, especially when general wage growth remains stubbornly slow is, I think, central to public discontent.”

As he prepares to leave the IoD at the end of this year, Walker will set out two issues that, in his view, need to be addressed – “the steady ratchet” of pay and superstar CEOs.

“The growth of the superstar CEO has been fuelled by the desire of boards to believe that their problems can be solved by a rare and magical leader. Paying top dollar becomes proof you have the very best,” he will say.

He is expected to point to the £14m pay deal for Bob Dudley, chief executive at BP, which was voted down at this year’s annual shareholder meeting in April.

He will describe Sir Martin Sorrell – chief executive of WPP – as “the ultimate superstar CEO”. Sorrell received more than £70m in shares and cash for 2015.

“I wonder at this point what function the money really plays: I think it is largely a signifier that he is the best in the business,” Walker will say.

He is also likely to warn about the impact of regulation on the sector: “Publication of directors’ pay was originally introduced to shame companies into moderation, but it has had the opposite effect.

“Firms have been drawn into competition with each other, and at the top end, pay has become a status symbol.”

Amid calls to publish the pay ratio – the gap between the chief executive’s pay and the average of the workforce – Walker will say: “Publishing pay ratios has been heralded as a transformative step, but we have seen the counterintuitive effect of publishing overall pay, and I’m not convinced that the data tells you all that much – is Goldman Sachs a more worthy company than Tesco because it has a lower ratio?”

The government’s green paper is expected to consult on pay ratios, the introduction of binding votes on pay and whether there should be advisory roles for employees on remuneration committees – which appears to be a step back from workers on boards.

A government source said: “The UK has led the world in corporate governance, but our strong reputation can only be maintained if government and business regularly reviews and upgrades our governance.”

Men are still paid vastly more than women across many jobs and regions despite firms “tinkering around the edges” to try to close the gap, according to a report.

Where men and women are doing the same job, they are usually paid almost the same – although men still have a slight advantage, earning an average of 1.6% more. However, the real gap is caused by the scarcity of women at the highest and best-paid levels of industries such as oil and gas, technology and life sciences.

The biggest pay gap – 34% – was in the east Midlands, followed by the south-east at 30%, the north-east at 28% and the West Midlands at 26%.

The study, conducted by the business advice group Korn Ferry Hay and based on research into about 500,000 UK workers, found that firms were offering incentives such as flexible working instead of tackling the problem head on.

Ben Frost, a pay data specialist at Korn Ferry Hay, said the figures showed that overall across the UK men were paid far more than women.

“This shows that organisations still aren’t dealing with the real issue here – which is that we need more women working in higher paying jobs and industries and at the most senior levels,” he said. “At the moment firms are tinkering around the edges by offering benefits like flexible working to address the issue. More fundamental change needs to happen.”

On Friday the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, challenged all Greater London Authority bodies to publish action plans to tackle the problem. He released figures showing a gender pay gap of 11.6% in the Metropolitan police, 19.2% in Transport for London and 35% in the post-Olympics London Legacy Development Corporation.

Khan made closing the pay gap in the capital, where his mother once stitched dresses for 50p apiece, one of the planks of his election manifesto earlier this year.

In July he published the first City Hall pay audit, which showed that women made up more than half of all employees, but less than a third of those earning more than £100,000.

Women in the UK have in effect been working for free since 10 November, which the Fawcett Society calculated to be Equal Pay Day for 2016. On average, women effectively stopped earning 51 days before the end of the year, relative to men.

Campaigners say the gap will take 60 years to close at the current rate of progress.

The Fawcett Society’s chief executive, Sam Smethers, said: “A root cause of the gender pay gap is that we don’t value the work done by women ... We are focusing on the fundamental question of who and what we value and asking why it is that we don’t value women and the work they do – paid or unpaid.”

When Andrew Hegerty started investigating how automation could improve his engineering business in Mackay seven months ago, a few eyebrows were raised.

Various economists predict automation is on the cusp of destroying millions of Australian jobs and Hegerty’s was a labour-intensive workplace.

For Hegerty, fear has been replaced by a belief that automation not only holds the key to long-term survival but it can create better jobs than those replaced.

More to the point, he says there is simply no choice – businesses like his can embrace automation or disappear. “I believe that automation will be the cornerstone of our business within the next five years,” he says. “Manual fabrication will become the exception rather than the rule.”

Hegerty’s company, the Mackay-based Team Group (Australia), provides engineering, fabrication, maintenance and other services to the mining industry, mainly in nearby central Queensland, but now also to some overseas clients.

North and central Queensland are exactly the sort of locations economists say could be savaged by workplace automation if the right policies are not put in place to foster innovation and skills for a new marketplace.

Examples of automation are popping up regularly in regional Australia. Driverless trucks have been operating above ground for some time, particularly in Western Australia, and now Queensland University of Technology is working with Caterpillar to develop driverless trucks that can operate in underground mines.

The Community for Economic Development of Australia released a report last year that found more than 5 million current Australian jobs, or 40% of the workforce, have a moderate to high likelihood of disappearing in the next 10 to 15 years owing to technological advancements. For regional areas with a focus on mining or manufacturing, the figure is 60%.

The wording of these predictions is important. The experts say 5 million current jobs will be replaced but they do not claim that will be the total decline in Australian employment. They say there is a need to ensure those jobs can be replaced by different ones, with new skill sets.

Ceda’s chief executive officer, Prof Stephen Martin, says although mining and manufacturing jobs are most at risk from automation, the impact will spread much further, affecting jobs that involve low levels of social interaction, low levels of creativity, or low levels of mobility and dexterity.

These could include brokers, mechanics, cashiers, construction workers, accountants and real estate agents.

Computers are becoming increasingly capable in all these roles. “Our labour market will be fundamentally reshaped by the scope and breadth of technological change, and if we do not embrace massive economic reform and focus on incentivising innovation, we will simply be left behind in an increasingly competitive global marketplace,” Martin says.

This industrial revolution, like others before it, will bring the opportunity to create new and more exciting jobs – but only if the policy settings and workplace culture are in place.

Mackay is a classic example of a region with plenty at stake as automation looms on the horizon. A huge percentage of its workers are either in the mines (on drive-in-drive-out or fly-in-fly-out arrangements) or in workplaces providing services to the mining sector. The region’s employment figures have d been dented by low coal prices, forcing a degree of introspection and adaptation.

Hegerty travelled to the US to learn more about how robotics and automation could improve his workplace. What he discovered there strengthened his resolve and he says once the first mental step is taken beyond the fear of job losses.

“I think not viewing this progression as exciting is counterproductive,” he says. “With Australia’s relatively high wage rates and competition for overseas markets, if we are going to be viable as a business, it has to be for more than the price of freight [otherwise foreign competitors will take over.]”

On his US trip, Hegerty saw manufacturing businesses performing tasks with automation that his workers in Mackay were doing manually.

He also discovered that “very few” workplaces had made a successful transition with the sort of processes he would require, so there were no illusions about the difficulties ahead. “We met with representatives of the Lincoln Electric Company and their subsidiaries to discuss robotic automation for our business,” he says.

“While the technology that we were shown was mind blowing, it was the process support that we received that was the kicker of our trip.”

Not only does Hegerty believe this transition will ensure the survival of his business in a global market where productivity and competitiveness are crucial, he has also noticed enthusiasm building among his employees. They want to know what the future holds and what they can learn to be part of the process.

His belief that automation could safeguard the region’s economy, rather than destroy it, is shared by others in the city. Mackay’s deputy mayor, Amanda Camm, is chair of the council’s economic development committee and believes automation offers a “real opportunity”.

She points to the city’s status as a hub for high-skilled mining services, as well as a geographical location that will allow it to capitalise on remote operations, such as driverless machinery.

Regional hubs for mining services, such as Mackay, can create jobs from innovation, but can the same be said for the mines themselves and the smaller towns around them? Martin says there is no clear answer to that question.

He says the risk to Australian jobs is significant because if the rest of the world moves ahead of Australia the nation’s businesses will become uncompetitive. Governments must start preparing the right policies to incentivise innovation and provide retraining opportunities for workers.

Martin also says the private sector must take responsibility. “Businesses need to accept change is happening and be looking for opportunities for how they can adapt and innovate in their business to keep pace and embrace the opportunities that technological advancement brings,” he says.

“For example, technology is making it easier to tap into global supply chains and sell to a much wider customer base and that can be done from anywhere.

Martin also points out that the jobs of the future in Australia are likely to be in the service sector, a significant shift from the years of the mining boom, and this will require a “serious rethink of how we train and retrain our workforce”.

One Australian already building robotic technologies for the workplace is the Queensland University of Technology researcher Prof Peter Corke. For one of his current projects, he has developed robots to perform a task most people would assume requires the softness of a human hand – fruit picking. In this case, his robots are in active trials picking capsicums.

While a robotic picker might be expected to bruise fruit and vegetables, the technology is now so intelligent – so millimetre-perfect – it can do the job as well as or better than humans.

It is a project with obvious relevance now, as the horticulture sector grapples with the shortage and high cost of human labour.

Corke acknowledges that the development of such technology raises existential questions about employment but he is optimistic about how new, more prosperous jobs can be created to replace those lost.

He agrees that setting government policies to foster innovation industries is the key but he also throws the challenge down to Australia’s universities, claiming they must change their mindset.

“We need to encourage our PhD students to think their future isn’t to become another academic, but it’s perfectly respectable or maybe even a better option to go out and join industry, or even create an industry,” he says.

“We really need to be training our graduate students to be thinking that success doesn’t look like, ‘I’ve written a paper and someone else is reading it.’

“We need to train them to think success is, ‘I’ve got a really awesome idea, I raise some money, I start a company and employ lots of people.’”

About 160,000 UK households are to face higher energy bills in the new year after the collapse of GB Energy.

The three year-old gas and power supplier, which pulled in customers with cheaper tariffs, blamed “swift and significant increases in energy prices” for its failure. The company’s demise creates uncertainty for its account holders, but they are not at risk of being cut off as the industry regulator Ofgem is expected to have brokered a move to an alternative supplier.

“It is with regret that we are informing you that GB Energy Supply is no longer trading,” said its managing director, Luke Watson, on the company’s website. “Due to swift and significant increases in energy prices over recent months and, as a small supplier our inability to forward buy energy to allow us to access the best possible wholesale prices, means that the position of the business has become untenable.”

Customers are no longer able to log on to GB Energy’s website to access their accounts and some took to social media concerned they would lose credit balances built up over the summer months. But Ofgem advised account holders to sit tight and wait to hear from their new supplier on how they would get their money back.

“There is no need to worry as we will ensure your energy supplies are safe,” said Rachel Fletcher, Ofgem’s senior partner for consumers and competition. “Ofgem are actively working with the industry to ensure your transition to a new supplier is as smooth as possible. While this process is under way our advice is not to do anything as you can continue to rely on your energy supply as normal.”

The government has sought to increase competition in the retail market dominated by the “big six” suppliers – British Gas, E.ON, Npower, EDF, Scottish Power and SSE . There are now 41 companies competing for British households, but the business models of the smaller entrants are now being tested as electricity and gas prices start to rise – partly because of the devaluation of sterling since the Brexit vote.

In an interview earlier this year, Watson, a former submariner who worked in sales before moving into the energy sector, said it had been fortunate that wholesale costs had been low over the past couple of years.

“I think the challenge for independent suppliers will come when there is volatility in the wholesale market,” he told the trade magazine Utility Week in June. “That is when the hedging strategy comes into play and we are very conscious of that ... It is a risk and we are monitoring prices three times a day.”

GB Energy previously traded as Altitude Energy Supply from 2013 to 2014 and made a loss of £630,018 on sales of £22.2m in 2015. The company operated from Preston and had a staff of less than 20 despite its large customer base.

Ofgem will move GB Energy customers on to what is known as a “deemed” contract. The watchdog says on its website these are usually more expensive: “The supplier takes on more risk, as customers are moved to a new supplier quickly without the usual background credit checks. So, they also charge more, to make up for this extra risk.”

It is then up to GB Energy customers to ensure they are on the best tariff or switch to a new supplier. But with wholesale prices up this year it is unlikely they will be able to find a deal similar to their existing plan.

The Bank of England is due to provide a snapshot of the strength of Britain’s biggest lenders after assessing their resilience to a dramatic economic downturn and sharp fall in house prices.

Threadneedle Street will announce the outcome of its annual health check of the six biggest banks – and one building society, Nationwide – on Wednesday, alongside its assessment of the major risks to the financial system in the wake of the Brexit result.

The Bank will also scrutinise the effectiveness of measures aimed at limiting the risks in the housing market. It has previously said it is concerned about the ability of some households to keep paying their debts if unemployment rises and wage growth stalls.

The results will be the focus for investors. The banks being tested are Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds Banking Group, Royal Bank of Scotland, the UK arm of Spanish bank Santander and Standard Chartered, which is based in London but has most of its activities in emerging markets.



The tests were introduced in the wake of the 2008 banking crisis and are based on hypothetical scenarios devised by the Bank. “In the Bank’s 2016 stress scenario vulnerabilities across financial markets and the global and UK economies crystallise,” the Bank said.

The test also incorporates projections for fines and other costs associated with misconduct, although the Bank said: “There remains a very high degree of uncertainty around any approach to quantifying misconduct cost risks facing UK banks.”

The Bank has set out an imaginary five-year period in which there is a “synchronised global downturn” under which the global economy contracts by 1.9% – as it did during the financial crisis. It has also incorporated domestic factors: a 31% fall in house prices, 42% reduction in commercial property prices with the economy contracting by 4.3% and unemployment rising by 4.5 percentage points. The dollar rises against emerging market currencies and the oil price troughs at $20 per barrel.

When the pan-European banking regulator, the European Banking Authority, published the results of its assessment on major lenders earlier this year, RBS took the biggest hit to its financial strength of any UK bank subjected to the health checks.

It is the third annual test by the Bank of England. In the first, run in 2014, the Bank had focused on risk to UK households while in 2015 on global risks, such as a contraction in China and parts of the eurozone.

A year ago, when the results of the 2015 tests were published, Bank of England governor Mark Carney had said the biggest lenders were strong enough to withstand the pressures in the global economy.

The stress test results will be published at the same time that Carney sets out the issues monitored by the Bank’s financial policy committee, originally set up by the coalition government to try to avoid a rerun of the 2008 crisis.

The FPC has also said it will use its half-yearly financial stability report (FSR) to set out its review of the policy measures announced in June 2014 “to insure against the risk of a marked loosening in underwriting standards and a significant rise in the number of vulnerable households”.

At the time, the Bank set out measures to restrict lenders’ ability to lend more than 15% of their mortgages to customers needing to borrowing four and half times their income. It also toughened the test imposed on customers through the mortgage market review, which tests customers’ ability to repay their loans.

All roads lead to Rome, and experience would suggest, all autumn statements lead to roads.

Under Alistair Darling there was an M1 upgrade in what was then called a pre-budget report. His Conservative successor George “we are the builders” Osborne pledged the biggest road investment programme since the 1970s and a permanent pothole fund. Then last week, Osborne’s successor Philip Hammond stuck with tradition and promised to push ahead with road schemes in the “northern powerhouse” and to tackle congestion on key routes under plans to revive the UK’s pitiful productivity growth.

Such nods to drivers and hauliers are easily explained in a nation where cars are by far the most popular mode of transport and where almost three times more goods are moved by roads than by water and rail combined. Promises to bust traffic jams and plug potholes are easy wins for politicians – as is endlessly freezing fuel duty.

Similarly, when it comes to appearing to be doing something about the productivity puzzle it is far easier to talk about roads than the thorny issue of Britain’s addiction to low-paid, low-skilled work.

But Hammond will not be able to escape this reality if he is serious about raising productivity – a measure of what is produced for every hour worked. Likewise, if he and Theresa May want to address the economic discontent that was partly responsible for the Brexit vote he will have to ensure any productivity gains he does eke out are shared by low-paid workers.

As the chancellor said himself, Britain’s productivity gap with its neighbours has real repercussions on living standards.

“In the real world, it takes a German worker four days to produce what we make in five; which means, in turn, that too many British workers work longer hours for lower pay than their counterparts,” Hammond said.

It was a welcome appraisal of a problem that is too often discussed in abstract, jargon-laden terms. But Hammond still fell into the usual trap of turning to infrastructure and innovation for the solutions.



Roads and inventions like next-generation electric vehicles are all well and good, but in an economy dominated by the services sector, it too needs attention if the country is ever going to make meaningful inroads on productivity.

Of course, many of the technological advances that are made under the badge of innovation can help in the services sector. Internet banking and automatic checkouts are obvious examples.

But there is also evidence that services employers can make productivity gains by changing the way they treat their employees.



The Joseph Rowntree Foundation has been exploring this link between the prevalence of low-paid work and low productivity. In an analysis with the thinktank, the Institute for Public Policy Research [pdf], the charity found low-pay sectors constitute about 23% of our economy, but account for about a third of the UK’s productivity gap with leading western European economies.

JRF is rightly telling ministers to broaden the industrial strategy to include low-paying parts of the economy such as retail, care and catering, and that by doing so they could make greater economic gains and lift hundreds of thousands of people out of working poverty.

Finding ways to lift productivity in those sectors is not easy. But if solving our low productivity problem was simple, countless experts would not have dubbed it a “puzzle”.

There are three key areas that employers and policymakers can explore, beyond the usual technology fixes.

The first is the relationship between pay and productivity. In a classic chicken and egg situation, economists argue over what comes first: low pay or low productivity.

There is an argument that employers can only afford to raise wages, when productivity goes up. But work by the Living Wage Foundation and others has found raising pay can in turn raise productivity. Better paid workers are more motivated and more likely to stick around and accumulate skills. Seen another way, when employers are forced to pay more, they are more likely to seek ways to make work more productive. Ideally, this will happen with the government’s mandatory national living wage.

The second area is flexible working. Consider the case of a woman working for a retailer. She acquires years of experience, then has a child, takes maternity leave and returns to work part-time. Her employer wants to capitalise on the woman’s experience and offers her a senior role. Fearful of how that new role will fit in with her childcare arrangements, the woman turns down the promotion.

When JRF commissioned research into productivity and pay in the retail sector by the economist and former MP Kitty Ussher, she found about half of retail workers who already worked part-time said they would only accept a promotion if they could remain part-time. Little surprise then, that the study also revealed half of retail workers felt overqualified for the work they did.

Clearly, employers are missing a trick when they fail to help workers find ways to balance family commitments with career progression.



Alongside these workers for whom the overriding priority was to have controlled hours, Ussher identified a second group who wanted to work more hours and gain promotion to increase their earnings. Among that second group there was evidence of frustration at the lack of opportunities to get on.

This leads to the third area: engagement. If staff do not feel involved in deciding their hours or career path, it is unlikely they will feel ready to share suggestions on how their workplace could run more efficiently. Productivity suffers as a result.

Words like engagement sound fluffy, but manufacturing – which consistently outperforms on productivity – has been doing this for decades. In a well-run factory, staff are actively encouraged to make suggestions on small changes that could raise their productivity, such as the positioning of a tool. It’s called “continuous improvement”.

Ussher’s research found this kind of engagement was lacking in retail, where 72% of workers felt they could see possible improvements in how their business ran, but just 44% said those ideas were taken seriously.

With management clearly failing these workers, it was welcome that Hammond’s autumn statement contained £13m for a scheme to boost UK management skills.

But workers need more than just better managers to be more productive. They need better career paths, including quality apprenticeships, and they need more economic security, not zero-hours contracts.

Employers are crucial in this and so too is government backing. If the chancellor really wants to “build an economy that works for everyone” he and his fellow ministers must resist the temptation to pick winners at the expense of those working in the vast, low-paying, low productivity parts of the economy.

About 160,000 UK customers face potentially higher energy bills after a budget supplier closed down, blaming rising energy prices.



GB Energy Supply ceased trading this weekend, leaving many faced with the possibility of higher charges unless they ask for the cheapest deal from their new supplier.

Ofgem will oversee a new firm being appointed for GB Energy’s former customers that will best protect their interests. The energy watchdog said no customers would have their energy cut off during the changeover and any outstanding credit balances would be protected.

In a statement, GB Energy said: “Due to swift and significant increases in energy prices over recent months and, as a small supplier our inability to forward buy energy to allow us to access the best possible wholesale prices, means that the position of the business has become untenable.”

Customers were advised to take a meter reading immediately and wait for the new supplier to contact them regarding any outstanding credit balances. It is then down to them to inform the new supplier that they wanted to be put on the cheapest deal, Ofgem said, meaning those who fail to do so could be hit by increased costs.



No exit fees will be charged as a result of the closure.

Rachel Fletcher, Ofgem’s senior partner for consumers and competition, said: “If you are a customer of GB Energy Supply there is no need to worry as we will ensure your energy supplies are safe. Ofgem are actively working with the industry to ensure your transition to a new supplier is as smooth as possible. While this process is under way our advice is not to do anything as you can continue to rely on your energy supply as normal.”

Citizens Advice said it was working closely with Ofgem to ensure a smooth transition to a new supplier. “Although GB Energy Supply has gone out of business, customers don’t need to worry,” said Victoria MacGregor, director of energy. “This shouldn’t affect their gas and electricity supply so they’ll still be able to heat and light their home as normal.”

As I see from many posts on money forums and social media, I know I am not alone in complaining about the John Lewis Partnership credit card. But my situation is vexing me. John Lewis Finance revamped its website in early October, asking cardholders to re-register. I did so. Then, two weeks ago, I realised that my card expired this month and a replacement had not arrived.

It was apparent from the online posts about failed payments and direct debit problems that all was not hunky-dory. John Lewis said there was a “high volume of calls” and warned of a wait of up to 45 minutes. After 70 minutes I gave up and instead tried secure messaging, which then collapsed, so I sent a letter of complaint and asked that my card be mailed within a week.

So far this has not arrived, although my account has said for several weeks that a card is on its way. Repayment day resulted in my “faster” payment being returned. I attempted to reset this and try again. This time it was rejected.

The coup de grace, though, was last night when I tried to purchase my grandson’s birthday present, only to find the card was declined because it is now out of date.

John Lewis brand this as its own card, but the debacle has probably been created by HSBC which, I understand, runs the credit card side. As I can make no contact with the company I think John Lewis Partnership should be shamed into taking some responsibility for this. JM, Peebles, near Edinburgh

What a shambles. The John Lewis Partnership card – and yes, it is administered by HSBC – is the retailer’s flagship credit card product, offering rewards which can be used for shopping at John Lewis and Waitrose. But, from our postbag alone, it is clear that changes to IT systems in October have triggered major problems including rejected online payments, problems logging in, unhelpful and unsympathetic responses from customer services, and very long wait times when trying to contact them. We have included a second letter below but have received many more.

The company admits there have been problems: “Following recent changes to the website we experienced some initial technical issues which have now been resolved. This led to high volumes of calls to our customer services team, which resulted in customers encountering delays. We are very sorry for this and have significantly increased the size of the team to reduce call waiting times. We can assure customers that any late payment fees, along with the interest which was incurred as a result of the recent technical issues, have been refunded. Customers should be able to spend on their card as normal, however if they are experiencing problems we would ask them to contact us so we can investigate on a case-by-case basis.”

Given customers’ difficulties in getting through, John Lewis has listed answers on the FAQs page of its website. Since our intervention it has called you and, as a result, you managed to pay your bill. It gave you 5,000 points as a goodwill gesture, but it’s unclear if other similarly affected customers will get this. You still don’t have a replacement card, although you have been promised it will arrive by the end of this month.

• My problem concerns the non-payment of a long-standing direct debit into my John Lewis account last month, and the consequent imposition of interest.

Despite what it says on the Partnership card website and in the customer service telephone script, this matter is far from resolved, and anyone who has experienced a problem with their direct debit should persist in contacting customer services and speaking to someone. I spent 20 minutes on the phone (after many abortive attempts) and got the strong impression that the operator had no understanding of the issue or facts, and the eventual assurances I was offered about all being well in the next payment round were far from convincing. DM, Malmesbury, Wiltshire

After several phone calls from John Lewis your direct debit issues have been resolved and you have been refunded in full with the interest you were erroneously charged – £63.33. John Lewis said this payment now appears under the header “cash finance adjustment” rather than “interest credit adjustment” which had also caused confusion, and has confirmed exactly where the credit appears on your account. It has also given you £50 in compensation – again, this may not have been given to all cardholders.

A market-leading savings bond announced in the autumn statement will hopefully encourage other providers to unveil better-paying deals, and could mean the government thinks interest rates may rise next year, according to one industry expert.

During his speech on Wednesday chancellor Philip Hammond pulled a small rabbit out of his hat in the form of a government-backed three-year NS&I savings bond expected to pay around 2.2% interest, which will go on sale in the spring. The Treasury said this was the “indicative” rate, and added: “This may be adjusted to reflect market conditions when the product is launched.”

The best current equivalent bond pays 1.63%, and Susan Hannums from Savingschampion.co.uk said the fact the government opted for a rate that is market-leading but not completely out of reach for other providers could encourage competition. “We may see a flurry of activity around that time.”

She added: “Does [the rate] mean they are expecting interest rates to rise next year? That might be why they are pricing it around that level.”

Nevertheless, the offer is not going to cause a mass outbreak of excitement, and many market commentators said high-interest current accounts still offer some of the best returns. Nationwide and Tesco Bank have, respectively, accounts paying 5% for 12 months and 3% with no time limit.

However, there was also bad news for savers last week, with figures showing cash Isa rates are on the slide. First Direct revealed it is cutting the rate on its cash Isa from 0.9% to 0.5% from 10 February 2017. It had only just cut the rate from 1.3%.

Cash Isa rates have taken a hammering of late, with information provider Moneyfacts saying the average long-term fixed Isa rate has dipped below 1% for the first time. This month the figure stood at 0.98% – down from 1.98% a year ago. The highest five-year fixed cash Isa rate currently on offer is 1.5% from Metro Bank.

Meanwhile, the average no-notice cash Isa rate is now just 0.73%. If you want a decent-paying easy-access Isa Coventry building society offers 1.1%. Those with cash in what may be the lowest-paying instant-access Isa – NatWest’s 0.01% on £1-£24,999 – should probably move it pronto.

On Wednesday, Hammond also confirmed the increase in the annual Isa allowance from £15,240 to £20,000 from April 2017.

Lucy Kellaway, associate editor of the Financial Times, has made news by announcing that, after three decades as a journalist, she is switching careers. Aged 57, she is to train to become a maths teacher. She also plans to work with a charity, Now Teach, to persuade others in midlife and older to follow her example and have what in the US is called an encore career.

“It’s one of the best jobs in the world but I’m not getting any better at it,” Kellaway said of her years in journalism. “I’m part of the lucky generation that’s paid off mortgages and has a pension. I can afford to do something that tangibly improves people’s lives.”

Not everyone, of course, is in what Kellaway describes as this “demographic sweet spot”: financially secure for life so they can make an occupational shift that may bring rich rewards but not pay the bills.

To be clear, an encore career is not the same as finding a job, any job, after redundancy, illness or “enforced retirement” – plights that have befallen 1.5 million people aged 50-69 in the UK in the last eight years, more than a million of whom would work if somebody would employ them. And it is different from having to work those extra years – to 70 for today’s twentysomethings, according to some predictions – to scrape together a pension.

In the US, Marc Freedman set up Encore.org, “second acts for the greater good”, 18 years ago to make use of the experience, wits and wisdom of older people. He defines these second (or third or more) careers in the second half of life, paid – on an often significantly reduced income – and unpaid, as combining “greater personal meaning and social impact to improve communities and the world”. Freedman was among the first to recognise what was unfolding demographically. The combination of longevity – many of today’s newborns will live to 100 – and retirements that already stretch to three and four decades, plus the sheer numbers of baby boomers reaching their 60s, 10,000 a day in the US, meant that volunteering required an overhaul and the entry requirements and training for jobs with social impact needed to adapt to admit recruits who already had 30 or 40 years of experience.

Freedman established a one-year training scheme, “a fellowship” so that a banker interested in, say, community regeneration or a doctor wanting to work in literacy, had accelerated instruction and a network of support. Then, 10 years ago, he launched a $100,000 Purpose prize for “exceptional individuals over 60 working to address critical social problems”, and innovation has flowed from the scheme. Among the winners of the prize are Vicki Thomas, a former executive in public relations, who via a charity, Purple Heart Homes, matches disabled members of the armed forces with repossessed homes donated by banks; and W Wilson Goode, a former mayor and retired academic, who runs a scheme mentoring the children of prisoners.

Inevitably, it’s not easy challenging the traditional pattern of working lives, as Kellaway has discovered. Men and women who have been teaching for years don’t take kindly to vintage amateurs, fortysomethings and older, arriving in the classroom. But, as she points out, an acute shortage of maths, science and language teachers has a negative impact on children and age may bring other benefits.

Recently, the government and Nesta, an organisation promoting innovation, announced grants of £4m to explore how charities and public services can tap into “the skills and experience of volunteers over 50 for the benefit of society”. But money alone can’t make a movement. It needs a man or a woman, such as Freedman, on a personal mission – and that, as yet, the UK lacks.

In the meantime, professors Lynda Gratton and Andrew Scott have been studying the issue of working lives in (much) later life and some of the stereotypes that hinder its acceptance. The co-authors of The 100-Year Life surveyed 10,000 people from across the world aged 24-80. The results, reported in the Harvard Business Review, indicate that it is not just the young who invest in new skills, who are excited about their work and who make an effort to keep fit. Those in their fifth, sixth and seventh decades do too. Again, while more than half those aged 46-60 want to “slow down”, fewer than 20% of those over 70 agree and more people under 45 (43%) than over (35%) said they were exhausted – with the least exhausted over 60. Leave aside the idea that rampant ageism might inhibit the 50-plus group from telling the whole truth.

Research says that retirement makes many of us happy. However, if you decide to delay it for a decade or so to take up a new career and “give something back”, that may also help to inject positivity into what is currently a highly negative narrative about our changing demographics and alleged inter-generational warfare. Encore careers offer a bonus not least in the power to shift ageing from a problem to part of a solution.

52, academic, producer, feminist activist, artist, director of her own company for 12 years, Home Live Art, qualified as a midwife in September 2016

“I began training at 47. It made internal sense to me. I felt I’d come to an end. I knew what I was doing in the arts and I wanted to work in a different way with people. I wanted to combine art and midwifery and in a more caring, direct, hands-on role.

“I’d been running my own company but in my midwifery training I enjoyed stepping away from the leadership role. I had experience but I had to show some humility and learn from people much younger than myself.

“I was the oldest in training but there were others in their 30s and 40s and I have good friends now in their 20s and that’s refreshing. I’m fortunate in that I could afford to take the financial risk, I have a supportive husband and my own business but other older students with me took a bigger financial hit and it will be tougher still with the removal of the bursary system [bursaries will be replaced with grants next year].

“I’ve been a mother for 20 years so now I feel very strongly about ‘mothering the mother’, looking after other women in childbirth. I see myself doing this part-time for 10 or 15 years. It’s not trying to forge a career; it’s for different reasons.”

“I’ve had a lifelong interest in economic and social justice and woods and trees. I got my chainsaw qualification as a way of relaxing when I was a trade union organiser.

“At 53, I resigned from a job at the International Labour Organisation in Geneva. I wanted to come home and do something that meant I could give something back and work in a sustainable way. I did a two-week tree-climbing course and everybody else was a lot younger but I’m in good health and a long-distance runner.

“My brother Eamonn was 50 and a retired firefighter so we set up the tree surgery business together. As a volunteer I also manage a 63-acre wood. We also recycle by turning the wood we bring down into firewood.

“If I’d stayed full time as a trade unionist I’d probably be dead from a heart attack by now. When I was at school the careers advice person gave me a test and told me that my ideal occupation was farming or forestry. Now I feel so lucky. I love it up in the trees. When you’ve been climbing all day you know it but as long as my body holds out, I’ll keep going.”

A mother of two sons, 18 and 23, Lee was a carer for 20 years after leaving school with GCSEs in English anda art. “It was the only thing I thought I could do.” Fourteen years ago, she began to care for John and Irene Leal, a former headmaster and his wife, both in their 80s. In 2012, with John’s encouragement, she began a BA fine arts degree. “He had been waiting for my results but he died, aged 95, the day before,” said Lee.

She received a first-class degree and won a scholarship to do an MA at the Royal College of Art in oil painting and photography, where she is now studying, in addition to working part-time in Sainsbury’s.

“I do oil paintings and the subjects are influenced by my passion about social issues, about poverty and unemployment and homelessness and the loneliness of older people. I visited South Africa in 2011 and it changed my whole way of thinking. I wanted to do work that meant something that could be a catalyst.

“I want to set up a gallery and a work space in a deprived community to teach young people and encourage local artists – to give them a chance of something better. As a student, financially it’s crippling – canvases can cost up to £200 – but I believe as long as you have passion you can accomplish anything.

“Half my sitting room is my studio. That’s where I make the magic happen. Being a mature student is challenging, delightful and sometimes it’s lonely, but I love the environment because I’m learning and it means, eventually, I can give something back.”

First of all, I want to reassure you that things are infinitely better where I stand today, than where you are now. At the moment it feels like nothing is going right – be that your job, boyfriend, family, or friends. You feel unloveable and out of control. This will pass. An unstable and, frankly, crappy upbringing has at times taken its toll on you.

Your first job was in the film industry as a runner in 1998. While you’re not afraid of hard work, the relentlessly long hours and low pay took its toll and after 18 months working in London, you were £15,000 in debt. This was quite the wake up call. You’d wanted to work in the film industry your whole life and then it wasn’t what you thought it would be at all.



Onto a B2B publishing house as a PA. It was here that you met Mundy Ellis, who took a chance on you and trained you as a journalist – she will teach you to fight for what you believe in, and that your natural cynicism is healthy. She will challenge and support you in equal measure and will be a positive female role model in your life. In time, you’ll go on to be that role model for others too.

Over the years, there will be more career changes – from journalism back to television and post-production, then to PR – but none of these moves will be wasted. You’re gaining so much great experience, making contacts for life, and paving your way to a job that loves you and vice versa.

Throughout this time, you’ve always been more than a little uncomfortable. You can’t stand still. You’ve struggled to fit into normal office environments – the sight of rows of bowed heads at rows of desks fills you with deep depression – and you’ve always questioned those in authority. You have a heightened sense of “what’s fair” and that’s not always paid off for you. But none of your struggles will be wasted. Those attributes that you think make you “unemployable” are what enable you to take the leap and become an entrepreneur. 



You’re able to deal with huge amounts of stress. You’re willing to take chances. You can cope with whatever is thrown at you. You have great planning and crisis-management skills.

In 2011, you will move back to Bristol and leave the depressing daily two-and-a-half-hour London commute behind you. You will start your own PR business Conversation Creation from your kitchen table and – after years of being ashamed by your surname, because of the connotations with your childhood – you will launch Espensen Spirit, a range of flavoured gins, vodkas and whiskies.

As I look around now, I’m surrounded by chaos – we’re about to open a cafe and event space on the ground floor of our office. But I’ve never been happier. It’s warm, relaxing and comfortable. I walk my dog to work every morning. I’ve found the balance between work and a personal life that you just couldn’t find in London. We often hear “I wish I loved my job”, but I think the desire should be to say “My job loves me”.

You will champion this at Espensen Spirit, by encouraging your team to set objectives that help them achieve the home life they want, as well as career goals. I’m not saying we’re relentlessly happy or never stressed, but we spend a great deal of time making sure every person we add to the team is right. We know we have the right ingredients to think our way out of a problem collectively, and support and care for each other. It is so important to surround yourself with the right people, and nurture a healthy culture around you. People are either radiators and keep you warm, or drains who are only interested in what you can do for them. I have a no drain policy now.

Mental health will always have a place in your life as part of your ongoing recovery from complex post-traumatic stress disorder (CPTSD), but it’s made you an ardent champion of putting staff welfare first. Those of us who have psychiatric injuries should not be afraid to search for the job that suits us. And you have found coping mechanisms that help, such as getting up at 5am and going to bed at about 8pm to deal with your insomnia. Self-care is the most fundamental part of your recovery.

No matter how stressful running my own business has been, it has never been as stressful as worrying about holding down a job working for someone else. Don’t sweat the small stuff. Without your fighting spirit, I wouldn’t be here to write this to you. So keep fighting. I’m very proud of you. That’s not something I would have been able to say to myself when I was your age, I know, but it’s true.

Car insurance premiums are set to break through the £600 barrier for the first time next year as insurers pass on higher costs and this week’s premium tax hike, experts are warning. On Wednesday the chancellor, Philip Hammond, announced he is to increase insurance premium tax (IPT) from 10% to 12% from June.

This means drivers, now typically paying around £50 a year to the Treasury when they insure their car, will see it rise to above £60. Some young drivers could have to pay more than £250 just in the IPT part of their premium, according to comparison site GoCompare.

IPT, levied on around 50m insurance policies (including car, home and medical), has gone up nearly five times since it was introduced in 1994 at a rate of 2.5%. The AA says the extra tax will add further pressure on drivers already battling steep increases in underlying premiums. Its benchmark British Insurance Premium index shows a 16.3% rise over the past 12 months with the average “shop around” premium at £586.

“It’s disappointing the chancellor seems to have used the potential £40 saving on the average premium due to the whiplash crackdown, to increase IPT,” says the AA. “The upward pressure on premiums continues, which coupled with the unwarranted hike in IPT will see premiums go through the £600 mark before any benefit from the whiplash crackdown takes effect.”

Matt Oliver, car insurance spokesperson at GoCompare, says there are still “genuine inflationary forces in the market”. “That means it is unlikely we will see any real flattening for motor premiums in the next few months.

“Until firm action is delivered on whiplash and the compensation culture, claims costs will continue to rise. Any signs that the rate had slowed earlier this year are likely to be completely undermined by the announcement of a further increase in IPT.”

What can you do to keep premiums down? Guardian Money advises:

• Shopping around at renewal is key, but do so in advance. Buyers get significantly lower quotes (£100 less) if they buy 30 days in advance, rather than the day before cover is required.

• Don’t overbuy cover – if you only drive 5,000 miles a year, don’t insure for 10,000. And if you can park off-road, do so and tell your insurer.

• Consider adding a spouse or parent as a named driver – it could reduce the premium by hundreds of pounds.

• Don’t soup up your car with sports exhausts, spoilers etc – but do fit a tow bar. Bizarrely, adding one can lower your premium by as much as 20%. Who knew?

What do you do when your children have moved beyond piggy banks but aren’t old enough for a fully fledged current account? The good news is that there are a number of “youth” bank accounts on the market that can help teenagers, and those fast approaching their teens, obtain their first debit card, learn about budgeting and take their first steps towards financial independence.

However, which provider you choose will depend in part on how much financial freedom you want your offspring to have. Are you happy for them to have their own debit card which they can use in shops and online? Or would you rather they were limited to a cash card that can only be used to withdraw money from ATMs?

Aside from the youth accounts offered by high street players, there are also a growing number of products available that combine a prepaid debit card with a smartphone app. These are likely to appeal to parents keen to retain control over what their children do with their cash – for example, they want to be 100% sure they are not buying things that they shouldn’t be, or spending too much on iTunes. But the downside of these card-app combos is they all involve a fee.

“By getting used to running their own financial affairs youngsters will hopefully adopt money-management skills that will stand them in good stead later in life,” says Andrew Hagger of financial website MoneyComms. “Teenagers are far more tech-savvy than their parents these days, and they’ll have no qualms about banking online and by smartphone, and using the likes of Apple Pay or Android Pay as a means of payment.”

Many banks offer these. Typically they are available to children aged 11 and above, making them a good home for pocket money or cash earned from jobs.

They work in a similar way to adult current accounts, but do not offer an overdraft facility, so a youngster can only spend what they have in their account and won’t get any nasty surprises, says Charlotte Nelson at financial data website Moneyfacts.co.uk. And there are usually no fees or charges.

Many of these accounts pay in-credit interest, though some may take the view that a table-topping interest rate isn’t their main priority because they will only be keeping relatively small sums in the account.

One account that might appeal to Guardian readers is the FlexOne offered by Nationwide building society, which has mutual (as opposed to plc) status, which means it is owned by and run for the benefit of its 14 million-plus members. FlexOne is aimed at those aged between 11 and 17, though it can be held up to the age of 23. There is a promise from Nationwide that it won’t charge anything for using the account, and customers can choose either a cash card for taking money out of ATMs, or a contactless Visa debit card that can also be used in shops, online and over the phone. The account can be managed via Nationwide’s mobile app and pays 1% credit interest on balances up to £1,000, plus offers a linked regular savings account paying 3.5%. (I should disclose that both my teenage daughters have had a FlexOne account for almost two years and they have been a success.)

Santander offers the 123 Mini Current Account for those aged between 11 and 18, where again there is the choice of a cash card or a Visa debit card. You earn interest once you have £100 or more in the account.

Meanwhile, both Lloyds Bank and TSB offer an Under 19s Account, paying 1.5% and 2.5% interest respectively on balances up to £2,500. These accounts can be opened by those aged 11-17 and 11-18 respectively, and both offer the choice of a Visa debit card or a simple cash card.

HSBC’s offering is called MyAccount and is for children aged 11-17. A Visa debit card is automatically provided, though the bank says that if for any reason this is not wanted, it can stop one from being sent out.

Meanwhile, Barclays has an account for those aged 11-15 paying 0.25% interest, with a choice between a contactless debit card and a cash card, as well as one for 16-19-year-olds.

Halifax has Expresscash for 11- to 17-year-olds which pays 1.51% interest and comes with a Visa debit card, as does NatWest’s Adapt account for those aged 11-18, which pays 1%. The Co-operative Bank does not have a youth account, but people can apply for its current account once they turn 16.

The opening requirements for these accounts vary, with an adult sometimes needing (or wanting) to be involved. Nationwide’s FlexOne, for example, can be opened online or in branch, though an adult must be present to open the account in branch for children under 16, while applications can only be made online for those aged 14 and over.

Nelson says that when choosing a youth account, “it’s always important to shop around and not necessarily stick to the same provider as the parent or guardian”. Hagger adds: “These current accounts aren’t marketed particularly aggressively by our banks and building societies, which is a shame as they are a must-have for today’s 11- to 17-year-olds who seek financial independence and the chance to pick up some valuable money-related life skills along the way.”

There are several of these and they all work in a similar way, with a prepaid Mastercard or Visa for the child alongside a mobile app. Typically, parents put money into their child’s card account, and the app enables them to monitor transactions. Three of the main providers are Osper, which is aimed at eight to 18-year-olds and their parents, and which has been endorsed by TV presenter Davina McCall; goHenry, for those aged between six and 18; and nimbl, for eight to 18-year-olds.

These offer quite a few advantages – for example, you can often “lock” the card if it has been lost or stolen, set spending limits etc. But these parental controls come at a cost: Osper is free for 30 days, then costs £2 per child per month, billed annually; goHenry is free for two months, then is £2.49 per child per month; and nimbl is free for three months, then £10 per card per year. In some cases there are even extra fees on top of this – for example, nimbl charges 49p per ATM withdrawal in the UK (the first one each month is free).

The real shock about this week’s decision to ban letting fees to tenants is that it did not happen earlier. For more than a decade in Money we have highlighted the exploitative activity of some (but by no means all) letting agents. It evidently reached such absurd levels that in the end even a Tory government had to end the farce.

We have seen letting agents demand £800 in fees on a £650-a-month one-bed flat. Bills for £360 for running a standardised contract through the photocopier, and £90 for a credit check that costs the agent little more than a fiver. Tenants have had to go through the rigmarole of these sorts of bills every time they are forced to move.

Back in May 2004 I wrote how some letting agents were “deceiving tenants out of huge amounts of cash with myriad charges and fees that verge on the criminal”. In 2009 I wrote “Letting agents: are they even worse than estate agents?” The same year I suggested we “let letting agents sweat”. Finally in June this year I wrote a column headlined “It’s time to end the great letting agency rip-off in England and Wales”.

Truth is, some agents got too greedy. Not that many will agree. When news of the ban emerged, Haart said it was “yet another unwelcome and haphazard government intervention ... yet another government blow for landlords.” LCP, a London agent, said it was a “further attack on beleaguered landlords”.

The victim mentality among some agents and landlords is comical. Official figures this week showed that over the past four years, average incomes have nudged ahead by 1.7% a year, while rents have gone up 2.2% and house prices have jumped 5.6%. In parts of the country, it has been a lot worse.

It is simply undeniable that the owners of property have won, and tenants have lost. Buy-to-let merchants have made gains of 1,400% since 1996, far better than any other investment. Yet it’s these winners who bleat loudest. If I were them I’d have kept my gob shut about just how much money I had been skimming off working people.

Some more perspicacious landlords saw it coming. David Lawrenson of LettingFocus.com said: “Banning all tenant fees is a draconian step. However, the letting agency business, in particular, only has itself to blame. Too many agents charged rapacious levels of fees, frequently far in excess of the actual costs. Also, we are convinced too many engaged in hiding fees, only revealing them at the last minute when the tenant was committed.”

Letting agents will now have to try to pass the costs on to landlords, which is only right because they are the customer and are in a much better position to decide if the fee is acceptable, or if they wish to take their business elsewhere. Unfortunately, on forums such as Property118 some agents are trying to devise “workarounds” – one alleges that “larger agents are secretly discussing setting up referencing companies, and will only deal with prospective tenants who will use their company”.

I doubt such ruses will work. I’m more inclined to agree with an agent on the same forum who said that the ban on fees has been in Scotland for many years and “the sun is still rising in the morning and the rental market is alive and kicking. One thing I find strange is the view that landlords will have to put up rents to accommodate this.

“In my experience, the market sets the rent, not the landlord. Most landlords will take as much rent as they can get for a property in the prevailing market, so to challenge this on the basis that rents will rise seems a bit disingenuous.”

When Christopher Seddon popped into a Waitrose store last May on behalf of his housebound 89-year-old mother, he was only planning to buy a few items to get her through the week. After paying, he was stunned when two policemen seized and handcuffed him in front of watching shoppers. He was then forced to spend six hours in a cell at the local police station before being charged with stealing £102-worth of meat.

Over the next three months Seddon, a published author who lives in north London, says he spent £9,600 on legal fees and expert reports to prove that it was a case of mistaken identity and clear his name. Eventually the case against him was dropped, and Waitrose offered £500 to say sorry because he is a “valued customer” – but he says the incident has left him thousands of pounds out of pocket and he describes the way he was treated as “nothing short of scandalous”.

Seddon’s nightmare began when he made his twice-weekly visit to see his housebound mother who lives alone near the Waitrose store in Chesham, Bucks. Each week he shops for her, but as he left the store on that fateful Saturday afternoon he was confronted by two police officers. “They seized me, then handcuffed me with my arms behind my back, stating that they were arresting me on suspicion of shoplifting 17 days earlier, in spite of the fact that on that day I hadn’t even been in Chesham. The security guard thrust a mobile phone in my face [with a CCTV still on it] and screamed ‘do you deny this is you?’ at me. All this was going on in front of dozens of shoppers.”

He says he was not allowed to call his mother, who he knew would be distressed when he inexplicably failed to return. He was held at Aylesbury police station for more than six hours.

“Despite the nightmare of the situation I assumed that I could clear up what was obviously a case of mistaken identity – but I was wrong. When I was eventually questioned, I was shown CCTV footage from the afternoon of 11 May showing a bald male aged about 60 concealing £100 of meat products in a bag and leaving without paying. I was told that I had been identified as the offender by the security guard from a CCTV still he had downloaded to his mobile. But on that day I was working on a book at my north London flat and, ironically, visited the Waitrose store on the Holloway Road.”

In a statement given to the police after Seddon’s arrest, the security guard claimed Seddon had also visited the Chesham store just a few days earlier and become nervous when he saw he was being watched. He said he then saw Seddon run from the store.

Seddon believes the police were greatly influenced by this claim. He says the CCTV evidence, not available at the time of his arrest, shows that while he was in the store at that time, it did not show him running away.

“I had come into the store for a bacon and egg sandwich for lunch, saw that there were none on the shelves and decided to go to Sainsbury’s instead. I left at a normal pace and never noticed the security guard. I even complained about the lack of bacon and egg sandwiches on Twitter. But the police believed the security guard’s account of me running from the store, as well as his claim that I was the man shown on CCTV stealing meat products, and charged me with the earlier theft.”

As a result, Seddon says he was forced to hire first a solicitor and then a barrister at a cost of £6,000 plus VAT. Knowing that he had been in London when the theft took place, but living alone, he had to employ a mobile phone expert to provide evidence to that effect. He also employed a CCTV specialist, John Kennedy, who made his name in the Jamie Bulger case in which CCTV footage was central to the conviction of the boys who abducted him.

Kennedy’s report states clearly that Seddon was not the person who had stolen the meat, and that the security guard’s claim that Seddon had run from the store was not true. It lists several key differences in the look of the two men, and even notes that their jackets were of different colours, contrary to what the guard told police. The expert report suggested that the photo of the thief on the security guard’s mobile phone was distorted in the act of downloading it. The image was compressed and the aspect ratio changed as a result, it said.

After Seddon had paid for all this, the case was dropped the day before it was due to be heard at High Wycombe magistrates court on the instruction of the Crown Prosecution Service. But Seddon says he has since been told by his solicitor that he will recoup no more than 20%-30% of his costs, leaving him substantially out of pocket. “Having cleared my name I approached Waitrose with my expert report, naively thinking that it would be horrified by what had happened and would offer me compensation for the inconvenience, distress and financial loss, as well as take urgent steps to ensure that such an incident could not be repeated,” he says.

Instead, he says the supermarket spent two months fobbing him off before concluding that its security guard had done nothing wrong.

“They offered me a derisory £500 as a ‘goodwill’ gesture to a ‘valued customer’. Their emails throughout were headed ‘Waitrose customer feedback’ as if the whole affair was of no more consequence than an unsatisfactory purchase from the bakery. If a security guard cannot distinguish between running and walking then it is a matter of significant public concern that they continue to be employed as a security guard,” he says.

A spokesman for Waitrose declined to offer an explanation as to what had happened. Instead, he pointed us towards Thames Valley police. “We are very sorry to hear of the distress Mr Seddon has experienced. You will need to speak to the Thames Valley police press office about the decisions taken. We are continuing our conversations with Mr Seddon and the third-party security company with whom we work so, as you will appreciate, it would not be appropriate for us to comment further at this stage.”

Seddon says questions remain as to why he was treated so badly. At a meeting last week with Thames Valley police, which is still investigating his complaint against the force, Seddon says he was told by a long-serving officer that he had not ever heard of a comparable incident.

Seddon is still furious at his treatment at the hand of the store, and is considering legal action. “If Waitrose will not accept responsibility, then sooner or later it will happen again to somebody else. For my part, I would have been better off accepting a police caution for a crime that I did not commit and paying Waitrose for £100 of meat products that somebody else stole. It is morally repugnant that I should be left thousands of pounds out of pocket when I have done nothing wrong,” he says.

Thames Valley Police said that as it had received a complaint in relation to this investigation it would be inappropriate to comment further.

Christopher Seddon’s treatment at the hands of both Waitrose and the police shows a gap in the law: a completely innocent person can be arrested and prosecuted and may not be entitled to any compensation, not even all of his legal costs, writes barrister Richard Colbey.

When police make an arrest they are not liable for the consequences if they act on reasonable suspicion. There are sound public policy reasons why they should be free to do their job without worrying too much about the consequences, so long as they behave reasonably. 



Here the report by the security staff gave them that suspicion and meant they were duty-bound to question Seddon, and entitled to arrest him. Marching him away in handcuffs was unnecessary and apparently deplored by a more mature police officer, but it was not unlawful.

Had the security guard effected the arrest the situation would have been different. There is not the same public interest in “citizens’ arrests”, and civilians have no protection if they arrest an innocent person, however reasonable the suspicion.

In 1992 a Marina Davidson was accused, wrongly, of stealing from Woolworths in Bangor. The court of appeal said that a security guard, and hence a Woolworths employee, could only be liable for an arrest if it was effected by the police – ie, if they had given some direction or made a direct request or encouragement that the arrest should be made. There the court of appeal decided that the store detective had merely made a report – but the guard in Seddon’s­ case may have overstepped the mark. 



Also it is possible that Seddon could claim slander, but that is a notoriously difficult and expensive cause of action. He would have to show the guard acted maliciously as, otherwise, what the guard said to the police would be privileged and also that he suffered “serious harm” – a somewhat vague statutory hurdle introduced in 2014 to discourage the proliferation of defamation claims.

A person acquitted of a crime will usually be able to recover his costs from public funds, but only at fairly derisory legal aid rates. These will be nothing like £10,000 even for a trial that goes ahead, and are typically hundreds, rather than thousands, of pounds. 



The Law Society advises solicitors to warn clients where they are incurring costs that are unlikely to be recoverable, and if Seddon’s solicitors had not given such advice then it could have taken a hit on much of the difference between its bill and the amount recovered.

• Update: Christopher Seddon has confirmed that his solicitors did advise him that he may not be able to recover all his legal costs of defending himself. The barrister’s view was amended on 28 November 2016 to clarify this point.

So will the ban on lettings agents charging fees to tenants push rents up? That’s the question many renters will be asking after the government’s autumn statement announcement.

The good news is that this is more than a proposal: the chancellor, Philip Hammond, said ministers “will” bring in a ban, which means that tenants will no longer have to pay fees that can run into the hundreds when they sign a new tenancy agreement. But some felt there was a worrying lack of detail – Hammond merely said it would happen “as soon as possible”, while the Treasury said the government “will consult on this in due course”. So it’s far from clear when the fees will be outlawed.

But how much do people actually pay? There are varying figures. The latest English Housing Survey, published in July, found that 40% of private renters were charged a fee by a letting agency or landlord in 2014-15, at an average of £223. Citizens Advice last year put the total average tenancy fee at £337, while a 2013 report from housing charity Shelter said one in seven (15%) renters using an agency forked out more than £500.

However, the biggest area of debate was whether the ban will drive up rents, on the grounds that landlords will now have to pay these costs and will simply pass them on to tenants. Or will landlords or letting agents absorb the costs?

Guardian Money decided to round up the views of experts and commentators on the key question of whether the ban will mean higher rents.

Generation Rent, which campaigns for better privately rented homes, says: “We don’t think it will [push up rents], mainly because rents are really just set by what people are prepared to pay in the market. Rents have been rising because demand has been so high.” The organisation says the fact that there is such huge variation in the level of fees charged shows there is a lot of scope for getting these costs down. It adds that landlords will have the power to shop around for lower fees.

PricedOut, the group campaigning for affordable house prices, believes it is “very likely that landlords and agents will bear most of the costs, as they have done in Scotland, which banned fees years ago”. It adds that even if all fees were to be passed on in the form of higher rent, “this will still benefit tenants, as their costs will be spread and they will find it easier to move home, giving them more bargaining power”.

Shelter published a report in 2013 that looked at what had happened in Scotland. There, it has been illegal to charge “premiums” – fees charged at the start of a tenancy, in addition to rent and the deposit – to renters since 1984. However, the law wasn’t enforced until 2012, when it was clarified. Shelter said its research had shown that landlords in Scotland “were no more likely to have increased rents since 2012 than landlords elsewhere in the UK”. In fact, only one landlord in 120 surveyed said they had noticed an increase in agency fees and had passed this on to their tenants.

easyProperty, the online estate agent, says: “Any sensible agency won’t pass on the charges to landlords due to competition in the sector, so we don’t foresee rent rises, as there is no need to add the fees to rents.”

Housing minister Gavin Barwell was asked two months ago whether he would follow the Scottish example and ban letting fees. He tweeted: “Bad idea – landlords would pass cost to tenants via rent. We’re looking at other ways to cut upfront costs & raise standards”. It’s not clear whether Barwell has since changed his mind… or had it changed for him.

Beresfords, a chain of estate agents, says: “Ultimately landlords will be expected to pick up most, if not all, of any fees lost by agents. However, landlords will want to recoup such increases, and the most obvious way to do so is by increasing the rent. Unfortunately, over time, tenants could end up paying much more in uplifted rent than what they would have expected to pay in initial fees at the outset.”

The Residential Landlords Association says: “This will not help tenants, especially those who are ‘just managing’. Agents’ fees have to be paid by somebody. If any extra fees are passed on to landlords, tenants will end up paying them for ever, as rents will increase.”

Simon Gerrard, MD of London estate agency Martyn Gerrard and a past president of the National Association of Estate Agents, says yields for landlords are already low, “so lowering them further means landlords will simply sell rather than rent, which will push rents up even higher because there will be less stock”. He adds: “The landlords that do stay in the market will have to increase rents to cover these new costs.”

Lord Bourne of Aberystwyth, a communities minister, said during a House of Lords debate on 18 November that Gavin Barwell has “been clear that we must be mindful of the potential impact on rents from banning fees paid by tenants… This is not a straightforward issue, and we have to be careful that any changes do not have impacts elsewhere”.

Over the past decade Sarah Cross has become an expert on London’s rental market, having moved every year between 2007 and 2015 – often not out of choice. So she was pleased at the government’s decision to ban letting agents’ fees to tenants. “That’s a really positive thing – previously we’ve paid nearly £1,000 just in fees and charges.”

Like many young couples in the capital, Cross and her partner work full-time but are still priced out of buying. They rent a “very compact” two-bedroom house in Leytonstone, east London, where they live with their son Oliver who is nearly two and attends nursery.

She and her partner both earn above the national average – their household income is £80,000 – but they still can’t afford to buy a family house in London. “We have no money to save after rent and bills,” says Cross, 31, who works as an operations specialist for a major company. This also means the couple’s plans to grow their family are currently on hold. “We’d like another child, but living in London limits your funds – and we don’t really feel like we have enough behind us to have a larger family.”

The couple pay around £1,300 a month in rent, with childcare swallowing a further £1,000. They are clearly not financially destitute – “We go on holiday” – but Cross adds: “One of us basically pays the rent and bills, and the other pays for childcare and essentials.”

Having had to move so often in the past, the birth of Oliver in 2014 saw them negotiate a two-year contract “to ensure we wouldn’t have to disrupt our whole lives one year later”.

Cross says that, like many people, they are in a catch-22 situation: house prices are stratospheric because too few homes have been built in London to sustain the number of people, but they don’t feel they can move out because “the employment wouldn’t be there”.

She says something needs to be done to get the capital’s housing market working properly. She is “intrigued” by the news of 40,000 additional affordable homes, but says: “It’s really important we build more affordable homes that are fit for purpose – we’ve viewed several shared ownership schemes and haven’t found one appropriate for family living - and that maybe we limit the price that we pay on rental properties.”

Cross is a supporter of the charity Shelter, which also welcomed the decision to ban letting agent fees.
