“Told you once before / And I won’t tell you no more / Get down, get down, get down.”

Family car journeys to visit relatives could so easily become tedious affairs, especially once the obligatory I-Spy session reached its natural conclusion. That’s when my younger sister Catherine and I would often resort to singing the latest hits to help the time pass quicker. There was no car radio or cassette player in our Ford Escort, so it was usually a reprise of what we’d heard on the latest Top of the Pops.

Dad’s parents lived in Southampton, requiring a 100-mile trip from our home in Essex. Dad was more into classical music, Mum more the musicals, but I like to think they tolerated the mini-concert emanating from the back seat. It was a great year for child-friendly glam rock in 1973, but the song that transports me back to our Easter holiday trip to the south coast is Get Down by Gilbert O’Sullivan.

At the age of 11, I wasn’t really a fan but at the time he was a regular fixture on TOTP and Get Down must have been No 1. The lyric also sounded appropriate to the occasion; it conjured up an image of parents who were getting irritated by the antics of children behind them.

Memories of singing on that April day are particularly poignant. The next time we embarked on that route was for Dad to make arrangements for Nan’s funeral. Grandad couldn’t really cope with the big house on his own so he downsized to a flat too small to sleep us all. Therefore our belting out of Get Down and its ilk somewhere on the A3 signifies something special: a time before my cosy family world was rocked irrevocably.

Ingredients

Into a large pan, weigh out the following:

8oz (225g) butter or margarine

8oz (225) brown sugar

4oz (110g) golden syrup

4oz (110g) black treacle

2 level tsp bicarbonate of soda

Mix thoroughly, then add two beaten eggs. Warm half a pint of milk and pour into a bowl on top of two level teaspoons of bicarbonate of soda. Add this to the mixture, stir well, then pour into a roasting tin and cook for about one hour and 15 minutes at 150C (gas mark 2).

This was the cake of my childhood, rolled out by my mum for every bake sale, school fete and visiting relative. It is baked in a big roasting tin and makes so many pieces – one batch seems to last for ever, which was a shame as I hated the stuff. I guess it was too sophisticated for my preteen tastebuds, which preferred shoplifted Wham bars and cola Hubba Bubba.

I remember going to my first Brownie camp, with a Tupperware tub loaded with giant ginger sticky squares. The Brown Owls and Snowy Owls swooped on it but us young Imps, Elves and Pixies eyed it with deep suspicion, like we would blue cheese. Still, I was glad I brought that tub to camp. A reminder of home, vacuum sealed.

Lately, though, more than two decades on, I’ve quite fancied a slice. Delighted, Mum sent me a photo of her old handwritten recipe and I set about making some with my five-year-old son.

It’s dead quick and easy, but looks worryingly sloppy when you pour it into the roasting tin (“It’s like a gingerbread lake, Mummy”). But fear not, it rises beautifully. Even the edges I burned have a satisfying treacle toffee crunch. I think it is best drowned in custard.

Crucially, my son is a fan. But will he be so enthusiastic after the 95th batch?

‘I would like a weekend off now, please,” tweets my work friend Jemma, who, after nearly dying in a riding accident, has spent months dealing so well with the challenges of tetraplegia. I have taken heart in her hitherto positive messages, but read in that tweet her sorrow and the momentary, and understandable, desertion of her coping.

I am not sure that I share her strength, so often I have wished that fucking cancer’s cup had passed us by. It didn’t, but I am learning to deal with it in a way that mines some positives from the seabed of grief. So I take inspiration where I can.

I am suspicious that Matt, in his delight of Christmas, has bought me a book about RAF hero Douglas Bader. I have always found him fascinating, a man defined but not constrained by the accident that resulted in the amputation of both legs. I still love the story David Niven recounted about Bader giving a talk to an upmarket girls’ school, and describing the German planes attacking him as “the fuckers”. This prompted the pale-faced schoolmistress to interrupt with, “Ladies, the Fokker was a type of German aircraft,” to which Bader replied: “That’s as may be, Madam, but these fuckers were in Messerschmitts.”

I would love the story to be true. Many years ago, I had dinner with Peter O’Toole and, for all his many stories, he hadn’t heard that one, and hooted with mirth before reaching for his next bottle. “Bader’s stumps made him mentally stronger than his enemies and gave him a physical advantage in the air. With legs, you’d probably never have heard of him. Tragedy can grant gifts – something to learn there,” he finished, blue eyes twinkling my way. Star-struck and young, I had had no idea what he meant, but I do now.

Bader’s accident had made him mentally robust and determined not to be cowed or constrained by anything, and physically he was helped by the fact that his heart had less body to pump blood around, so he could peform tighter turns in a dogfight without losing consciousness.

For me, knowing that loss is now my brother is tragic but emboldening. I have no fear of change, or the decisions that change demands. When friends ask, “Will you look for another job in the media?” I say no with some certainty simply because I now see work as renting out bits of precious, short life – no money is worth something you no longer love. Bereavement is dreadful, but once you accept that the life you had is unrecoverable, you might just be able to create a new one that isn’t simply the old version but sadder.

So it was that when we briefed the brilliant stained-glass artist Tony with five of Helen’s passions for memorial windows in the Yorkshire house – a cathedral’s medieval knocker, an art deco light at the local cinema, her children’s story detective character, the battlements of the local historic house and the Hogwarts’ logo – I was reminded how much I loved stained glass and decided to go on a taster course in Scarborough.

There I met Dawn and her husband, Terry. We got on well, even going together to the theatre where Alan Ayckbourn is the director, with the great man sitting behind us critiquing the revival of one of his plays. Dawn seemed to be struggling. “It’s a shame,” she said, “but I’ve got cancer in my spine and won’t live very much longer.” I’m poleaxed, but also inspired. Just as Helen never stopped her piano lessons, Dawn is here on a course to learn a new skill because she enjoys it despite her illness. So many people spend their lives afraid of change, but I realise bereavement has gifted me a willingness to embrace it and not spend a moment of my life killing time or treading water.

So I approach Tony and will shortly be taking up a role as the oldest stained-glass-window trainee in the country. I know Helen would approve. Without her death, I would have had neither the courage nor the cash to take the plunge. She was the best part of me and in her loss I have gained an advantage over my risk-averse former self. It is another legacy of her love. I must not squander these new opportunities nor allow them to be shot down in flames out of fear.

Many of us will be spending Christmas with family this year. Some of us are wildly excited at the prospect, some ambivalent and some will be dreading it. In the days after the event thousands of people will be having tense discussions with their partner, stuck on various motorways around the country, about how next year they will be spending Christmas at home with the curtains closed and the door locked, and definitely not seeing family.

But it needn’t be like this, in fact when asked about fun in childhood, most adults talk about family as the most significant factor in their having fun. So here are seven sure fire ways to ensure fun festivities with the family.

Fun is social, families are social. Families are tight-knit units where members are assumed to have a good time with one another. However, they are full of “characters” who know each other well – and often familiarity breeds contempt. But rather than getting annoyed at the foibles of family members, revel in them. Enjoy the bizarre interactions. You can make a game of such idiosyncrasies by playing “family eccentricities bingo”, where a bingo card listing things that people always say or do is given out to everyone on Christmas Eve. The objective is to fill the card by Boxing Day. The winner gets to choose the route of the ever-popular Boxing Day “bracing walk”.

Fun is often vicarious. Much of the fun we have is when others are having fun. This is never more evident than at Christmas, where the fun can deteriorate as the day wears on – particularly when the kids have been up since 3.30am. To avoid this, make sure you pay attention to the fun of others. That can be in ensuring that everyone is happy or content. They needn’t necessarily be having fun, but you will be.

Fun and funny aren’t the same thing. When Christmas is going well, the house is full of laughter. However, fun and funny are different things. Be careful that laughter is not directed towards one or two people consistently. Fun happens when people feel part of a group, and laughter can be a means of exclusion, even if it is not intended to be. This means paying attention to what we say and how we say it – and this needs care and a certain degree of management.

Fun is contextual. Think in advance of the situations in which your family tends to have fun. It is tempting to suggest things to do at Christmas because they always happen – but if nobody really enjoys a “nice board game”, why insist everyone play one? You can be imaginative about the ways in which some things your family do well can be accentuated. If you are in a family of show-offs, do things that allow people to show off. If your family is less gregarious, think how individual family members can feel included, but the key is that things are done together.

Much fun is had through repetition. For many of us, tradition plays a significant role at Christmas – particularly important for children. Make the most of your family traditions – perhaps invent new ones. Talking about the past is often fun and there are family stories that get told and retold. Make sure you make time for conversations about Christmases past – the children love hearing about their family in bygone years and older family members will love telling you all about it … again.

… but be relaxed about spontaneity. Many people find fun takes them by surprise and being spontaneous is important. This does not sit comfortably with many of our experiences of the festive season. Christmases are often planned with military precision, but it can be liberating to imagine that not all of the plans need happen if something else fun is going on. Treat the plans as a guide that will be partially met. As long as everyone is having fun, the overall objective is met. Mission accomplished.

Turn off the screens. Other people are at the heart of our fun. At Christmas the temptation is to concentrate on the material stuff – presents – and increasingly this means screens. However, the Christmases we remember fondly are full of happy times talking and laughing with those close to us.

I was in a local pub recently when I  overheard a lament about Christmas opening hours. Contrary to what you may hear in The Archers or see in EastEnders, many British pubs now close on Christmas Day. The man at the bar was clearly troubled. Where was he to go on 25 December? The landlord – who was obviously looking forward to putting his feet up on Christmas Day – said there were quite a few websites that would tell you which nearby pubs were staying open, but I could see his regular was troubled. Not only was this the pub where he had always drunk on Christmas Day, but he had suddenly lost his surrogate family and at the most vulnerable time of year.

Depending on your circumstances, Christmas Day can be a nightmare. It is up there with Valentine’s Day if you are unhappily single, and Mother’s Day and Father’s Day if your children aren’t speaking to you. You can’t pretend it is just another day and simply get on with your life. Everyone and everything is telling you it’s Christmas Day. Even the Queen gets in on the act. There are few worse days to be on your own. It happened to me 14 years ago.

Newly divorced and with a lovely new flat in a new city, I stood at my picture window and watched a family – grandparents, mother, daughter and dog – going for a bracing post-lunch walk. Seeing them striding out, with an ecstatic dog and a young daughter in new gloves and coat rushing ahead, I remember thinking, “I’m like you. I’m sure if you met me, we’d get on.” But I knew I couldn’t nip down, introduce myself and say, “I’m all alone on Christmas Day. Can I walk with you?” They would have called the little girl over and put her safely between the mother and grandmother until the strange, sad man went on his way.

I wasn’t entirely alone in the world that day. On Christmas Eve, I had taken my children to their grandparents and we had opened presents over breakfast on Christmas morning and then I had driven them to their mother’s and come back to my flat.

At first, I felt like Matt Damon as The Talented Mr Ripley having his solitary Christmas in Rome. I unwrapped my presents, ate and drank some special things I had saved up for the big day. I may even have watched The Talented Mr Ripley. I certainly fell asleep at one point in best post-prandial style.

But when I woke up and walked to the window and saw that family, it hit me that here I was, in my late 40s, and life had only ever prepared me for “Christmas Day with family”, not to spend it on my own. I had been enjoying the single life up until that moment.

For many people who are on their own at Christmas, there are surrogate families. Going to church or helping out at a refuge can supply a sense of community, but as we lose pubs that offer open house on Christmas Day, we are losing the kind of family that many single men crave, the kind of benign family where you can drop in and chat, or keep to yourself but still feel welcomed by fellow human beings.

So how do we cope, we men who are looking at being on our own on Christmas Day? I address this question deliberately to men because I am one and can’t really speak to the female experience – although I have always felt that women have more effective support groups than men. But that is only because we have none.

It is a question of attitude. My overwhelmingly strong feeling was that I needed a family on Christmas Day. But Christmas doesn’t have to be about families. That was my mistake.

When I think back to The Talented Mr Ripley, Christmas Day is presented as the moment of perfect stillness in Tom Ripley’s turbulent life. In his Rome apartment, he plays the piano and sits by the fire opening a present that he has bought himself and that he clearly loves. Yet it is not the present, the music, or even the glass of wine he sips, that makes this moment special, it’s the stillness. The world stands still on Christmas Day. This stillness, at a point when the planet feels as if it has ceased to turn – and we will remain in the depths of a silent winter for ever – is a great moment to recharge our spiritual batteries.

Looking back, I see it was a mistake to gaze longingly at that family out on its bracing walk. I should have been enjoying the calm of a Christmas afternoon entirely on my own, rather than wishing it away. I was outside family life for the first time and, instead of appreciating the wonderful silence, I wanted to get back into family life as soon as I could.

The funny thing is, exactly 12 months later I drove my children from their grandparents to their mother and, instead of driving back to my flat, I drove on to Devon with the M5 entirely to myself (a very odd experience that quickly convinces you that zombies have taken over). When I got to Bideford, there was the family I was going to marry in to three months later. There were grandparents, there was my fiancee, there was her nine-year-old daughter and there was the dog.

I don’t quite know how I managed it. They can’t have been the family I saw walking that Christmas afternoon, but it was strange how what I got for that Christmas was exactly what I had craved the year before.

But my point is not that if you wish for something hard enough, you will get it. The world is full of people who have wished hard and been desperately disappointed. No, my point is that if you are alone without a family this Christmas Day don’t wish it away but see if, like Tom Ripley, you can enjoy it. I think you can.

The first of the three fathers that Nicky Loutit remembers is Robert Kee. He had been a fighter pilot and prisoner of war, and later became a writer, broadcaster and member of the “famous five” who founded TV-am. He was handsome, charismatic and angry.

Aged two-and-a-half, Nicky was put in a children’s home by her mother, Janetta, who is now 95. “She said to me recently that she knew I didn’t like that home, but she was so mad about Robert that she put me there for my own protection,” says Nicky. “She felt she was saving me. I remember crying and crying and crying. Still now, it makes me cry. If I’d talked about it 10 years ago, I probably wouldn’t have cried.” Getting older, says Nicky, now 73, she “feels more tender”.

Nicky is a painter who has produced a unique and haunting memoir, in pictures and words, of her extraordinary childhood. It reveals a trio of fathers who were highly regarded figures in public, but who, in private, variously inflicted on her mental, physical or sexual abuse.

She is upset when we meet because an event to promote her book has been marketed as, “Come and meet Nicky Loutit, the sexually abused child from the London elite.” Her publisher points out that this is all true. “I don’t remotely feel I am an ‘abused child of the cultural elite,’” says Nicky. “The book is more about an old person remembering ghastly things and the emergence of exquisite beauty.”

Then again, she recognises the possibility that her distress about the event is a form of denial. “I’m astonished at the power of denial. Even when I was little, teachers might say, ‘I understand you’re from a broken home.’ I was like, ‘That’s fine.’ ‘No self-indulgence’ and ‘nobody is special’ was what I picked up from my mother and her friends. I was in constant pain, but I didn’t recognise it. I had this wonderful act, acting cool, and it was gross denial. Gross denial gave me the strength to get through.”

Nicky was the first child of Janetta Slater, a beautiful young bohemian woman who mixed with leftwing artists and writers of 1940s and 50s London: Kee, George Orwell and the literary critic Cyril Connolly. Unsurprisingly, given Connolly’s famous dictum about “the pram in the hall” being an enemy of good art, Nicky felt unwanted, an impediment to the creative high-achievers around her. “That’s what made me so vulnerable to being abused,” she says. “I was desperate to be some use, in some way.”

When Janetta fell in love with Kee in the late 1940s, Nicky, her daughter by another man, was “in the way”. Nicky “genuinely can’t remember” if Kee pushed her down the stairs, but she had a terror of stairs as child. “He used to get hold of me and violently shake me, shouting, with his face very close to me. It was very frightening. He was jealous, resentful, maddened. For anyone else, he was charming, amusing and very popular.”

Nicky wasn’t in the care home for long and was reunited with her mother before being sent to boarding school. Nicky loved her new school uniform and tie but was subjected to a subtler form of mental abuse after her mother left Robert for Derek Jackson, a brilliant, wealthy physicist who split from Pamela Mitford to marry Janetta in 1951. Derek drove eight-year-old Nicky to her new school in his flash car. “He had this great Buick and I was embarrassed. He sensed my embarrassment and drove round and round on the gravel in front of the school. He loved it.”

Derek called her Knickers. “Oh, God, he was ghastly. I never liked him. He was quite happy to pay for me to go to school, he wanted to please my mother, but he didn’t care a fiddle about me.” He would test Nicky on maths and delight in her failures. She often confuses her numbers, even now.

Derek had a daughter with Janetta. “When my sister was born, Derek went off with my mother’s sister. My mother was devastated and miserable. It was all very frightening. The big question of my childhood was to help her be happy – it was the wrong way round, but that’s how it was.”

All the while, Nicky secretly idolised her biological father, Kenneth Sinclair-Loutit. He was a doctor who had treated casualties in the Spanish civil war and enjoyed an illustrious career with the World Health Organisation (“His life is an inspiration to all of us,” said a newsletter for former WHO staff after his death). Janetta never married Kenneth but Nicky bore his surname, looked a bit like him and “thought he must be wonderful”. She only met him a couple of times but her fantasy was sustained when he posted her “a really exciting American Indian leather jacket. I was thrilled with that present but it would be months, years between contact.”

When she was nine, the one reliable man in her childhood helped to reunite father and daughter. James MacGibbon was a publisher and friend of Nicky’s father Kenneth; Nicky played with James’s son, Robert, and adored them both. James, Robert and her father planned to sail across the Channel and on to Paris together and James, thoughtfully, suggested they invite Nicky along.

In her book, Nicky’s paintings recall her excitement about the trip, the boat setting sail and then the horror: her father forcing himself on her in a cramped cabin. He sexually abused her on their week-long journey across the Channel and up the Seine to Paris. She couldn’t tell anyone: “He specifically said it was something special between us.”

The MacGibbons slept in a separate cabin and didn’t know. They were appalled when Nicky told them 30 years later.

Boarding school was a release. “I felt saved by boarding school. I loved it but had to slightly pretend that I didn’t, because my mother and her bohemian friends were scornful of school,” she says. She was beaten by a maths teacher and then found friendship with one particular teacher. “He was wonderful, very inspiring,” she says. “He loved me and I was very important to him.” He took her on little excursions in his car and read Under Milk Wood and the Bible. He continued lessons in his bedroom, where several pupils joined him in bed. As his favourite, Nicky had to put her head on his chest. “Looking back, it was sexual, but it wasn’t overtly sexual like my father’s abuse,” says Nicky.

One day, she was swimming with other pupils, naked, in the lily pond in the school grounds (which, bizarrely, they were allowed to do). She had reached puberty and her friends were envious of her breasts, but he saw that she had “got too big” and “I wasn’t this sweet little girl snuggled up to him”. He ended their special relationship. “It was devastating. His rejection was like everything in my childhood. It wasn’t said, so I couldn’t reply, ‘Please don’t.’ It just happened. Suddenly, I was never invited into his room again.” She recalls his next favourite: a younger, skinnier pupil. “It was terrible,” she says.

“Everyone’s life is like that isn’t it?” says Nicky at one point. “This isn’t brute horror, it’s just normal life.” Doesn’t she feel angry about her abuse? “Oh. Anger,” she ponders. “A lot of the abuse wasn’t violent. I’ve had a very privileged life.” But she is angry with her father. “I can rage at the image of him in his grave. I can’t really speak to my father’s [other] children, who don’t really believe my father did anything, so there’s anger there.”

When she was 15, she met him again, in Paris. “He took me out to dinner and wanted the fantasy that we were lovers. I was terribly confused. He didn’t lie on top of me and do terrible things like he did when I was younger, but I was certainly in an abusive relationship.” A decade-and-a-half later, she confronted him about the abuse. “He cried and said, ‘Yes, I was a terrible bastard’ and he was so sorry. I even managed to feel sorry for him, but he tried to continue his sick relationship with me. He was never really sorry and he never really changed.”

Nicky’s adulthood has been shaped by this abuse. Most disastrously, when she was a young mother, with three young boys, she and her ex-husband joined an ashram in India led by a charismatic, free-loving, abusive guru. Nicky was beaten up in group “therapy” yet remained in the ashram for four years. Nicky knew she must escape and eventually returned to Britain, where she raised her three boys. “Was it being a painter?” she wonders. “Somehow I knew there was beauty in life too and I had to get out.”

Nicky can now talk about her three abusive fathers but is less comfortable discussing her mother: “Her own mother died while she was pregnant with me and she hated her father. She was a lost, beautiful young thing in the war. She talks about me in rosy, romantic terms, what a wonderful, independent child I was – ‘independent’ is the biggest praise she can give anyone. That was just how posh parenting was in those days: children were seen and not heard.”

In contrast, Nicky’s three grown-up sons are “absolutely central” in her life. “They are all terrific, which is amazing because I’ve not been a terrific mother,” she says. “The only thing I’ve done is consistently loved them.” Despite her traumatic childhood, her life, she says, has been full of beauty. “Painting isn’t an escape, but through creating I’ve realised the depth of existence. Even if I’m agonised, there’s another side full of joy and light. I’ve had such a rich life and I’m grateful. I suppose I was enabled to explore, even when things were very painful.”

She does not see herself as a victim. “Funnily enough, being a victim is one of my mother’s positions,” she says. “My mother was quite clear, ‘All men are bastards’, but because of the abuse, if men wanted me that was wonderful.” When she met her current husband, the author Jonathan Gathorne-Hardy, she was “startled that he could be so kind,” she says. “The major thing he’s done is allow me to be myself and we’ve really, really loved each other ever since, so that’s all right.”

I wonder at her achievement of enjoying loving relationships when her childhood was cursed by terrible men. “How the hell have I done it?” she laughs. She points out that as well as her two marriages she’s had great support from James MacGibbon, his wife and their son, Robert, who is still a close friend. “I did feel loved,” she says. “There’s always been someone in my life who has sort of loved me.”

How is it that a ton of old metal can make a grown man cry?

This heavyweight bohemian is nearly 40, has four wheels and a fibreglass pop top. It’s my campervan, or to be precise it’s no longer my campervan as I have just sold it.

Each morning, the first thing I see outside my window is this crazy orange character – a free spirit of the 70s that doesn’t say much, but speaks to me in code. We have a telepathic relationship. Just a glimpse at those long simple lines makes me smile and for 10 years it has been my constant, my reliable friend, a conduit for my hopes, my dreams and most importantly my symbol of dad-dom. And over time this van has made me feel better about myself.

If I could, I would mate with such beauty – except he’s a boy and he’s called Dave.

The thought of him leaving home has created a hole in my heart, which I know will be VW-shaped. God, I’m going to miss him.

A decade ago, having just gone through divorce, I became obsessed with buying an old VW. It had to be the Type 2 and the more orange the better. That iconic shape was burned into my psyche ever since I bought a cheap split screen as a 20-year-old and drove through Europe for six months with my Australian girlfriend. Back then, Italy had the lira, Spain the peseta, and Greece the drachma. The trip felt terribly exotic.

But I wanted more than to just recreate a sense of freedom and adventure, I also felt the need to provide something my kids would think of as uniquely “dad”. It had to encompass an experience they would enjoy, look forward to and participate in because they wanted to, not because they felt obliged.

Having moved into a rather pokey and clinical flat, I couldn’t compete with the family home and, rightly or wrongly, felt I needed reasons for the children to want to be with me. Everything was smaller and darker where I lived, so what better way to make them think time spent with Dad was fun than by enjoying life under the stars?

The VW campervan had all the required prerequisites. It was one of the few objects that spanned the generations. It was stylish, cool and came with a fridge, which at one stage was more than could said for my flat.

It took months to find it. There were many fruitless journeys around the country, arriving a little too late for some, finding others held together by suspect welding and extra shiny ones with eye-watering price tags.

And then Dave came into my life and my van-tastic romance started. Owned by a loving family who spent years on careful renovations and getting him roadworthy, they initially eyed me with suspicion. It was as if I was being interviewed for a job. Was I good enough to care for Dave? Would I bring him up right? As they parted with their beloved, I noticed a deep sense of regret, but he was mine now …

After presenting Dave to the kids with the minimum of fuss (Oh yeah, Dad’s got a campervan, kids. Check me! Backflip!), I parked him outside and posed holding a large hippy flower. They looked quite proud.

Over the years, we set off at dawn to all parts of the country: Devon and Cornwall with a surfboard; the New Forest with bikes, and Norfolk to strap on harnesses for Go Ape treetop adventures. And each time we’ve parked, within seconds we’ve flipped up the top, dragged out the small gas cooker, and started to sizzle sausages. It’s been a bonding experience, but without the major fuss of camping under canvas. Then, in the evening, we’ve sat together under the stars, looking at the moon, knowing we’ll get a fine night’s sleep even if it rains.

I would drive Dave at a heady 57mph – not that he couldn’t go faster, it was just that I didn’t see the point. Dave was born in the slower, pre-internet era when having five gears was showing off. If Dave wanted to take his time, I may have been in the driving seat, but he was the cool dude calling the shots.

Few drivers took exception to my slowness and occasionally I was known to put my foot down. When heading back from Cornwall, my son and I were flagged down by an unmarked police car. I gave my son a cheery thumbs up thinking Dave had actually managed to sneak past the speed limit. Instead, we were given a lecture as the back wheel of my bike was inhibiting a full view of the brake light.

Back home, when my daughter was revising for exams, she’d sit in the van. I’d pop out every hour or so and there she was, on the main road, with her books spread over the van’s table. Dave had become her library and can take full credit for preparing a maths teacher of the future.

The van was a symbol of what fatherhood represented to me. He was dependable, fun and always there. He looked slightly bulky and just chugged along at his own speed. (Although, like any dad, he’d still got enough in the tank to attract attention with his own special dance.) And of course, he gave the illusion of being so damn cool.

For Christmas and birthdays they bought me model kits, VW miniatures, VW egg cups and salt and pepper shakers. Over the years, I became synonymous with my camper.

But then the inevitable happened. The children grew up. My daughter left home and my son went off to university. They acquired boyfriends and girlfriends and my reason for having Dave started to fade. Suddenly, all the van things we did together were being relegated to the past. Would the kids really want their dad, a middle-aged geezer with a dodgy T-shirt, at Glastonbury?

I secretly dreamed that one day I would again do the tour of Europe. But more sedately. Or, maybe the kids would implore me to take them to Cornwall for old times’ sake. And although I knew the truth, each time I tried to summon the courage to sell, I managed to find something else to do. I couldn’t bear to think of Dave’s smiley face no longer parked outside my door.

So I hung on, and for two years the van’s remained part of the family, waiting for a trip further than the shops. He’s been underused and over-cleaned and has been taxed and insured purely as an emotional crutch. I could not part with him – it was like being told I could never tell bad dad jokes again.

Then, of the blue, Dave’s previous owners contacted me. They inquired gently if he might one day want to return home. I wanted to scream: “But he is home! I’m the daddy! This is where he belongs.”

His old family missed him so badly that their lives had never been the same since I bought him. He was just the pick-me-up they needed. I was so touched, I really had no option.

The symmetry felt right and I realised I wouldn’t have to worry about him because he’d be back with another dad, doing all the things I once did. I was just passing on the mantle.

I’m a little choked as I wave goodbye. Dave’s work is done.

It started with the decorations. Christmas was once a supermarket plastic bag bristling with sweet, tacky, red and green tinsel that smelled like 20 years of pine, a string of mini pretend presents that, in spite of their very obvious hollowness, begged to be opened, and – most important – the angel tree-topper. Her face was a 1970s plastic nightmare. I loved her. She meant magic.

Apparently, my dad had bought the whole job lot from a petrol station, way before I was born. Little did I know, aged four, they had been purchased in the spirit of, “this’ll do”.

One December in the late 90s, they disappeared. I came home from school that evening to find something grim. Something unholy. Something … classy. My mum had been to Habitat. The arboreal costume jewellery of every Christmas I could remember had been replaced by wicker balls painted a matte gold so unenticing I cried. Where was the tinsel? Where was the beautiful drag queen-looking angel? Where was Christmas? As I sat weeping for the lost innocence of that day, my mum tried to explain to eight-year-old me what “naff” meant. The new decorations – if anything so insipid can be awarded decoration status – dangled like upcycled Weetabix. I’d recently learned about Hitler. I think I hated them more than Hitler.

So began my mum’s all-encompassing programme of de-sentimentalisation. She and my dad reinstated the “this’ll do” philosophy. And this time round I noticed. For my older siblings and me, Christmases and birthdays now, increasingly, meant one thing: cash.

“How much do we give them again?” my dad would ask my mum, before stuffing the contents of his wallet into cards to suit whatever occasion had been simmered down to the emotional equivalent of buying a pack of batteries.

By the time I reached my teens, my family’s cold war on gift giving was in full swing, fuelled by mutually assured disappointment. This didn’t start as an anti-capitalist, or anti-commercialisation movement; it was mostly just anti-effort. My mum’s reasoning was that taste is just too personal a thing. For her, being presented with some unknown thing wrapped in paper is to relinquish control. Why buy one another things we’re bound to hate when we could buy ourselves things we actually want? Eyes locked on the middle distance, she tells the story of when, in the 80s, my dad bought her seed pearls.

“You could barely even see them,” she says of the earrings that were – if her increasing volume is anything to go by – anathema to her. In all fairness, my mum has never been a seed pearl kind of woman. When I was three she had a pair of earrings made of pink liquorice allsorts, which I duly ate. The point is though, jewellery-wise, if it’s not loud, she’s not interested. To her, my dad’s choice of seed pearls prompted the question, “Who do you even think I am?”

My seed pearls were boat-shaped. At Christmas 1996, when I was seven, I suffered a mild identity crisis when I unwrapped a remote-control yacht. Just to clarify – this is in no way a case of “pity the poor, neglected child who got a toy yacht for Christmas”. I wasn’t upset, exactly; I was confused. I hadn’t asked for a yacht. I’m not sure I knew what a yacht was. When my older brother took me to the park to sail this “yacht” thing on the pond, I watched with bemused indifference as it bobbed around for 30 seconds before sinking like a shoe. I was almost relieved. The yacht wasn’t me at all, and I was disturbed at the idea of having to become a yacht person, so as not to offend a presumably senile Father Christmas. When I didn’t cry, my brother assumed I was dead inside, and we went home. Yacht-less. The highlight of that afternoon was learning what “capsize” meant. To this day, my dad claims I asked for that yacht. Knowing me, and not knowing yachts – I didn’t.

As far as my mum was concerned, the yacht incident was perfect fodder for her anti-gifting propaganda machine. “See what happens when other people choose possessions for us?” Maybe she’s right in a way. Perhaps gifts are just expensive emblems of how little we actually know one another. I still really wanted them though. I wanted wrapping paper. I wanted suspense. I wanted the “naff” Christmas decorations back. Where’s the mystery in opening a card and having a couple of banknotes flop on to your lap? It was borderline bureaucratic. Every birthday felt like payday for the job that was staying alive another year.

My brother, whose annual refrain is “Mum’s ruining Christmas again”, has managed to maintain his rigidly pro-gift stance. Meanwhile, I’m weakening. My terrifyingly practical older sister – now too busy with two young kids to wrestle with the endless email thread of family politics – has been on my mum’s side all along. My dad hovers in the background, shrugging from behind his laptop.

I have a suspicion that another one of my mum’s motives for her crackdown on gifting was the avoidance of mess. The first Christmas my now brother-in-law spent with my family, he was horrified to be woken up – at 7am – by my mum ushering us all down to the Christmas tree with the festive call of: “Let’s get this over with, I want to tidy.” Genuinely afraid of disobeying her, we sat in the living room opening our presents as quickly as possible, while my mum disposed of wrapping paper like some kind of bah, humbug robotic furnace.

I have friends who do “Christmas shopping”. Who agonise for days over what things their family may genuinely like. Granted, these friends probably have conventional Christmases with drunk uncles, and Monopoly, and turkey. I doubt they grew up – as I did – thinking Christmas dinner was all about screaming and tidying. Constant tidying.

There is nothing more festive to me than the melancholic, “hoooooooove”, of a vacuum cleaner, and my mum yelling, “Whose is this?” seconds before binning whatever “this” may be.

In recent years, the mess and sentimentality elements to gift giving were stripped so bare that, as an entire family, we’re down to one Amazon voucher.

Whoever has a birthday receives a now ceremonial email informing them that they are, for now, in possession of The Voucher, which has been paid for by the rest of the family. The Voucher is passed from person to person, from birthday to birthday. The Voucher is good. The Voucher is safe. The Voucher is invisible. All glory to The Voucher. Although, while it may work for birthdays, we haven’t figured out a way of making it work at Christmas. Perhaps the only logical solution is that we sit in a circle, each behind a laptop, and everyone buys an Amazon voucher for the person to their left. We all press “send” at the same time. One blow of a party horn indicates it is time for us to shake hands. The second blow signals the end of all festivities until next year.

This year, as usual, my mum has suggested a full moratorium on Christmas presents. A part of me wants to buy her something so meaningful that her faith in gift giving is restored. A much bigger part of me knows that, whatever I buy her, she’ll pretend to like it for about 15 minutes, begin to grimace, ask for the receipt, then dispose of the wrapping paper like it’s nuclear waste. All evidence of there ever having been a present will be demolished.

Twenty years on, my yacht may still be at the bottom of that pond. Coated in algae. Ignored by frogs. Serving as a wistful reminder to absolutely no one that, in some families, gift giving is futile.

The band I’m in has three gigs across the weekend – two in Kent, one in the West Country. At this time of year we tend to arrive at venues after dark, which can be disorienting. Later, while trying to establish a rapport with the audience, I’m reluctant to admit that all I’ve seen of their town is a pay and display car park, or to complain that poor mobile reception left me unable to look up interesting facts about the area.

Overall I try to avoid saying too much, but there comes an inevitable moment early in the first set when I have to talk while a guitar change is effected. In order to make these moments seem spontaneous and unrehearsed, we tend to rehearse them not very well. I once forced an audience to pretend to be from Salisbury so I could reuse an anecdote from the previous evening.

After the second show, in Kemsing near Sevenoaks, I drive home. When I arrive my wife is still up, sitting in the kitchen with a visiting friend.

“You’re not supposed to be here,” she says when I come in.

“I barely am,” I say. “I have to be up and out tomorrow.”

“How was the gig?” the friend asks.

“Fine,” I say. “I got flustered because my banjo wouldn’t stay in tune, and said stupid things.”

“Shut up about your band,” my wife says.

The next afternoon I arrive at South Petherton in the dark, after a three-hour drive. Once again I have no idea where I am, except in relation to the A303. After the sound check we have a brief discussion about who is going to speak and when, but nothing is settled.

“Is this Somerset?” I say. “Are we in Somerset?”

The hall fills. At the appointed hour we take the stage. Between the second and third songs, my inevitable moment arrives. I step up to the microphone, my mind a perfect blank.

“It’s great to be here in South Petherton tonight,” I say. “It brings us one step closer to our dream of playing in North Petherton.”

There is a collective intake of breath, followed by a long, rumbling boo and some hissing.

“I guess that means there actually is a North Petherton,” I say. The boos become louder and more sustained.

“Any North Pethertonians in tonight?” I say. “Maybe don’t raise your hands.”

I mention North Petherton several more times during the first set, each time eliciting catcalls and general derision. I feel I have united the audience in a single purpose, but I also get the sense I’m playing with fire.

During the interval, a local resident tries to explain.

“There’s a sort of ongoing antagonism,” he says. “It’s weird, because North Petherton is 20 miles away.”

“You mean they had to move it?” I say.

My confusion only deepens. It’s not as if the two villages are fighting over a playing field, or the rights to a shared aquifer. I get the impression few of these people have ever met a North Pethertonian in the flesh – it’s at least a 45-minute drive. It seems to me a wholly irrational hatred, based on ignorance, fear and misdirected post.

But the people of South Petherton know how to have a good time. Afterwards they come up to thank us, and to buy our promotional tea towels. They shake our hands as they file out, begging us to return soon.

“This was a good gig,” I say to the guitar player.

A man in a dark coat touches my elbow and leans toward my ear. “Seriously,” he says. “North Petherton’s a shithole.”

Sweet aromatics infuse the winter months: ginger, nutmeg, clove, clementine, spiced rum and brandy. Their exotic, warming flavours wrap around you like a warm blanket. My California blood almost curdled when I was first faced with Christmas pudding, but now I crave the concentrated sweetness of sun-dried fruits in midwinter. We all know a recipe for the classic, but why not switch things up now and again? This week, I’ve created five show-stopping alternatives to Christmas pudding.

At this time of year, I can’t get enough of cranberries. A traditional New York-style cheesecake is only made better with this tart, pungent compote.

Makes 1 cake

For the cheesecake

175g ginger biscuits

75g butter, melted

600g cream cheese

180g caster sugar

¼ tsp salt

¼ tsp cinnamon

A grating of black pepper

A grating of nutmeg

¼ tsp mixed spice

A pinch of ground allspice

2 tsp vanilla extract

4 eggs, plus 1 extra yolk

200g creme fraiche

For the cranberry compote

340g cranberries

300g caster sugar

Zest and juice of 1 orange

2 Grind the biscuits in a food processor until fine. Stir in the melted butter, then press into the bottom of the tin.

3 Beat the cream cheese with the sugar, salt, pepper, spices and vanilla until smooth. Beat in the eggs and extra yolk. Fold in the creme fraiche.

4 Wrap the bottom of the cake tin with tin foil, then scrape in the batter. Put it in a roasting pan large enough for it to sit in comfortably. Pour in water to 3/4 up the side of the cake tin and bake for 1 hour 20 minutes. It should have a slight wobble but be set around the edges. Allow to cool completely, then chill in the tin for at least 2 hours.

5 For the compote, add all the ingredients to a heavy-based saucepan. Cook for around 15 minutes, or until jammy. Allow to cool.

6 Serve the cheesecake with a dollop of the cranberry compote, or spread it all over the top.

Custard and cream are flavoured with ample nutmeg and booze, topped with perfectly ripe bananas drizzled with lashings of dark chocolate ganache.

Serves 6-8 

For the meringue

4 egg whites

¼ tsp salt

½ tsp vinegar

1 tsp vanilla extract

270g caster sugar

2 tbsp cornflour

½ a nutmeg, grated, plus extra to finish

For the custard

50g cornflour

4 egg yolks

600ml whole milk

100g caster sugar

½ tsp salt

2 tsp vanilla extract

For the cream

400ml double cream

2 tbsp rum

A grating of nutmeg

1 tsp vanilla

2 tbsp caster sugar

To finish

3 ripe (but not over-ripe) bananas

1 Preheat the oven to 110C/230F/gas mark ¼. Line a tray with baking paper. With an electric mixer, beat the egg whites, salt, vinegar and vanilla on a high speed until soft peaks form.

2 Whisk the sugar, cornflour and nutmeg together by hand, then add half to the frothy egg whites. Whisk until very stiff, then add the remaining sugar mixture. Whisk until smooth and glossy.

3 Pipe the meringue into a 23cm circle or oval, making a slight depression in the centre. Bake for about 2 hours. Remove from the oven. Transfer the meringue on to a cooling rack right away to cool completely.

4 To make the custard, have ready an iced water bath, with a bowl set inside it. In a small bowl, whisk the cornflour into the yolks.

5 In a heavy-based pan, heat the milk, sugar, salt and vanilla until it starts to foam. Pour a little over the yolks to temper, whisk, then return to the pan. Cook until the custard has thickened and coats the back of the spoon. The custard should be the thickness of a creme patisserie.

6 Transfer the custard to the bowl set in the iced water bath to stop it cooking any further. Cover the surface of the custard with clingfilm to prevent a skin forming. Chill.

7 For the cream, mix all the ingredients together in a large bowl. Whisk until it has just thickened into loose peaks, as it will continue to thicken after you stop whisking. Set aside.

8 To make the ganache, chop the chocolate finely and put in a heatproof bowl. Heat the cream until it is just bubbling, watching it closely to ensure it doesn’t bubble over. Pour the hot cream over the chocolate, and leave to sit for five minutes. Stir to combine and until the ganache is shiny.

9 To assemble the pavlova, transfer the meringue to a serving dish. Top with the custard, then the cream, and finally the sliced bananas. Drizzle with the ganache, and finish with a grating of nutmeg.

Dried figs are plumped with the remains of yesterday’s red wine and steeped in spices, then drenched in honey. The texture and stickiness of this one makes it my favourite.

Makes 1 cake

400g dried figs

165g unsalted butter

75g brandy

300ml red wine

Zest of 1 orange, and 25ml freshly squeezed orange juice

250g honey, plus extra for drizzling

1 egg

1½ tsp ground cinnamon

¼ tsp ground cloves

200g wholemeal wheat or wholemeal spelt flour

1½ tsp baking powder

½ tsp bicarbonate of soda

1 Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4 and line a 23cm cake tin with baking parchment.

2 Trim the rough stems off the figs, then chop into 1cm pieces. Cut the butter into small pieces and allow it to soften to room temperature.

3 Put the brandy, wine and dried figs in a heavy-based saucepan and simmer over a medium-low heat to plump the figs. After 15 minutes, remove the pan from the heat and cool for 20 minutes.

4 Add the orange zest and juice, then stir in the butter and honey. Leave for 15 minutes, then whisk in the egg.

5 In a separate bowl, whisk together the cinnamon, cloves, flour, baking powder and bicarbonate of soda. Slowly whisk into the wet ingredients. Transfer the mixture to the prepared tin, and bake for 45 minutes.

6 Cool the cake in the tin for 10 minutes, then turn out on to a plate. To serve, drizzle with a little extra honey and serve warm with yoghurt.

Claudia Roden’s orange cake is famous for its use of an orange boiled whole. I’ve spiced it up here with cinnamon, added whole, unpeeled almonds that you grind yourself, and drizzled it with a Cointreau-laced syrup.

For the syrup

Juice and zest of 1 orange

100g caster sugar

100ml water

Juice of 1 lemon

4 tbsp Cointreau or other orange liquor

2 Wash the oranges, then simmer them whole (including their peel) in a saucepan of water for two hours. Cool, then cut open and remove any pips.

3 Grind the almonds to a fine powder in a food processor, then set aside.

4 Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6. Cut the oranges into quarters and put in a food processor. Process to a pulp. Add the ground nuts, then the eggs one at a time, then the sugar and baking powder.

5 Scrape the batter into the prepared tin and bake for about an hour. Cool in the tin, and then turn out on to a serving plate.

6 For the custard, put the bay leaves and the cream in a heavy-based saucepan. Steep over a medium heat just until the cream comes to the boil. Watch it closely as it can boil over.

7 In a bowl, whisk together the yolks and sugar. Temper the yolks with a little of the bay cream, then return to the saucepan and whisk over a low heat for five minutes. Allow to cool.

8 For the syrup, put all the ingredients into a small saucepan. Reduce by half. Skewer the cooled cake, then pour half of the syrup over just before serving. Serve the remaining syrup separately for pouring over individual slices of cake with the custard.

This is made with the moreish caramel that results from reducing cream and sugar or condensed milk into a jam. Chocolate and cinnamon have a long history together in Mexico and here they make this delicious, self-saucing, flan-like dessert more Christmassy. The cake mixture and the flan mixture could both be made in advance and then assembled and baked closer to the serving time. Alternatively, you could bake the dish a few hours before serving and serve at room temperature, but it really should be made on the day.

For the cake

150g caster sugar

100g plain flour

40g cocoa powder

1 tsp ground cinnamon

½ tsp bicarbonate of soda

¼ tsp baking powder

A pinch of fine sea salt

180g plain yoghurt

4 tbsp mild olive oil

1 egg

1 Preheat the oven to 190C/375F/gas mark 5 and have ready a roasting tray that is large enough to house a round or oval pudding dish, and is at least 4cm deep. Spread the dulce de leche inside the pudding dish, as if you were buttering it. Sprinkle with the Maldon salt.

2 For the cake, whisk together the dry ingredients. In a separate bowl, whisk together the yoghurt, olive oil and egg. Whisk the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients, and pour into the prepared pudding dish.

3 In a separate bowl, whisk together the evaporated milk, condensed milk, eggs and vanilla. Decant into a jug, and slowly and gently pour this over the chocolate cake mixture. You want to try to keep distinct layers at this stage.

4 Set the pudding dish within the larger roasting tray, then carefully fill the tray with water until it is halfway up the sides of the pudding dish. Cover the whole roasting tray with tin foil (shiny side down), and bake for one hour, until the chocolate cake has risen to the top and is set.

5 Remove from the oven and allow the pudding to cool for 10 minutes in the water. Remove from the water and cool for another 10 minutes. Run a small sharp knife around the perimeter of the pudding to separate it from the dish. Invert on to a serving plate and serve.

Do you remember that TV channel, Trouble? In the late 90s/early 00s, it was a colourful graveyard for American teen and young adult shows of the recent past, repackaged for young British eyes. It brought me TV shows no other channels would have thought to – and is how I came to watch The Parkers, and fall for the comedian and actor Mo’Nique.

The Parkers, a sitcom about a mother and daughter attending college together, was a nice break for Mo’Nique, now 48, but it was hardly her first outing in the business. She was doing stand-up before the siren call of TV, and if you haven’t watched her (filthy, hilarious, repeat: filthy) sets, particularly her turn on The Queens Of Comedy, I urge you to. Her jokes can be uncomfortable, but then they come from uncomfortable situations, and I appreciate that edge; her riff on “skinny bitches” will always make me laugh. Her raspy voice is like a shot of something strong and oaky, and her laugh is contagious, even when you’re semi-scandalised at the joke.

She has branched out from straight comedy, too: her stunning portrayal of Ma Rainey in the TV film Bessie shook me up; before that, she won an Oscar for her astounding performance in the 2009 drama Precious. She’s an agile dancer, too (her Instagram is a delight) and her little inspirational quotes about love and life give off the vibe of a woman who is happy with her lot.

But comedy’s still her main thing: earlier this year, she released a special, Mo’Nique’s Something Different, and her new family comedy, Almost Christmas, just came out. With that infectious laugh, she’s the best thing in it. Of course.

Television chef Michel Roux Jr has emerged this week as an unlikely champion of the common man. He is worried that restaurant goers do not understand the difference between a tip and a service charge, and hopes that others in the catering industry “will join me in making it clearer for the public to understand what they are paying for”.

He said this after admitting that his restaurant, the Michelin-starred Le Gavroche, keeps all the service charge added to its customers’ bills, instead of distributing the cash to staff.

Allow me to help. A tip is cash given to your waiter in a private transaction denoting personal gratitude and also shared knowledge that the restaurant trade generally pays front-of-house staff as little as it can get away with. A service charge is a ruse restaurants have developed in order to gain control over the tips their underpaid staff might otherwise receive. Which I think is pretty clear.

How could it be otherwise? Adding a service charge in a restaurant is like adding a body-covering charge in a clothes shop. The whole point of going to a restaurant is to sit at a table while people prepare and bring food and drink to you. Or, to put it more simply, to receive services. And pay for them. A service charge is a charge on your charge for services. The public is confused, as Roux knows perfectly well, because restaurants want us to be.

The trouble is that people are not as confused about Roux’s restaurant as they were a couple of weeks ago. First, it was revealed that staff in the extremely posh restaurant were being paid £5.50 an hour for a 68-hour week. Roux said he was sorry – presumably he meant for flagrantly breaking the law in this manner while assuming that the victims of this violation would protect him because they wanted the work.

But he couldn’t leave it there. When the thoughts of his critics turned to questions about what happened to service charges and tips, Roux, or a spokeswoman anyway, decided once again to have a go at outfoxing people. “Wages are not dependent on fluctuating levels of discretionary service charges or cash tips.”

That sentence has a terrible beauty about it. The spokeswoman is trying to make out that it would be terribly unfair to let staff rely on the vagaries of customer discretion and that they’re doing the staff a favour by “treating service charges as revenue”, so that no criminally underpaid staff member is left behind. They pay tax on the service charges, they explain. So if their staff need in-work benefits, they’re doing their bit there too. Lovely.

So, basically, Roux has come over all educate-the-public because he got caught out in deceiving the public. I say the public, though of course hardly anyone can afford to eat at Le Gavroche, which is now raising its menu prices because it’s removing its service charge. Which only goes to show what a moveable feast, if I may say, the service charge was in the first place.

The depressing thing is that this issue has been around for years. If the public isn’t by now fully educated about the less than transparent nature of service charges and the variations in how they are distributed, then we’re never going to be. The government is currently considering making it illegal for businesses to take any cut of service charges at all. This is a good idea, but as we have seen from the wages paid at Le Gavroche, the most putatively respectable and financially secure of businesses are not at all averse to breaking the law.

Yet more depressing is the fact that the public for whom Roux cares so greatly is so enthusiastically complicit in helping the world of business and finance towards its goal of a cashless economy – in which money can become entirely abstract even as it controls and tracks our every move. We don’t want to fart around with splitting bills on cards then digging around for cash to provide a tip as well, because we’re all convenience junkies. It makes it easy for businesses to hoover up everything.

And you can never tell the good guys from the bad guys. Plenty of restaurants are pretty scrupulous about ensuring tips are divided equally among employees. They’re the ones in which the staff are familiar figures, because they stay for years in their jobs. And that really is the second best way: the charming young people who know how to flirt will get plenty of tips, the acne-scarred washer-upper will get none. So pooling and dividing the tips evens out the Darwinism.

The best way, of course, is to set your wages so that neither the giver nor the receiver feels used or exploited, mutual respect is maintained and no one relies on tips at all. But, somehow, that kind of thinking seems to be something akin to totalitarian Marxism.

Meanwhile, back in the gentle world of the free market, the only thing to try to keep doing is naming and shaming, picking off bad employers one by one so that others think they might be next. It may not be the village green stocks. But it’s still pretty medieval. No wonder restaurants weren’t a thing back then.

The Netherlands has found a solution to the problem of car doors and cyclists (Transport secretary knocks man off his bike, 16 December). Dutch motorists are trained to open the car door with their opposite hand. This forces the body to swivel, and your eyes to look backward, thus spotting a passing cyclist. Drivers must demonstrate this to pass the driving test. It is referred to sometimes as the “Dutch reach”. In the Netherlands it is simply called how you open your car door.

• As the transport secretary is now a little more aware of the safety issues surrounding the opening of a door, can we look forward to a prompt resolution to the current rail dispute?

The Japanese owner of Jim Beam, Maker’s Mark, Teacher’s and Courvoisier is thought to have paid as much as £50m to buy out Sipsmith’s shareholders, including Sam Galsworthy and Fairfax Hall, who founded the brand with Jared Brown just eight years ago.

All three will be staying on to run the business, which has 35 staff and will continue to be run out of its traditional copper pot distillery in Chiswick, west London.

Galsworthy said Sipsmith already sold 30% of its gin overseas and demand was “growing like billyo” in the US, Australia and northern Europe as well as Japan. He said teaming up with Beam Suntory would help the company achieve its aim of building a lasting brand.

“We have worked tirelessly to share our gin of the highest quality with discerning sippers,” said Galsworthy. “In this new chapter, we have found the perfect partners to take Sipsmith to all four corners of the globe.”

Sipsmith is one of hundreds of artisanal distillers set up in recent years amid a growing trend towards smaller brands with an authentic backstory. It claims to have pioneered a gin renaissance in London by starting up the city’s first copper distillery for nearly 200 years.

Sipsmith’s sales have risen by between 60% and 70% a year for the past two years as Brits have been quaffing gin in record amounts. This year 40m bottles were bought as a 19% rise in sales outstripped growth in sparkling wine, according to the Wine and Spirit Trade Association (WSTA).

That is part of an international trend that has led to gin exports rising at record levels. Sales to the US alone have soared 553% in the past decade, reaching £159m in 2015.

Jonny Forsyth, global drinks analyst at the market analysts Mintel, said it was no surprise that Beam Suntory had bought Sipsmith as the major spirits producers recognised they faced a challenge from fast-growing craft brands.

“Millennial consumers, in particular, really value small-batch heritage spirit brands rather than big brands with a more mainstream audience. It is a lot like the craft beer where we’ve seen big brands say ‘it’s time we bought these brands before they become big competition’.”

He said the buyout of the craft gin distiller Monkey 47 by Pernod Ricard in January marked the beginning of a trend that was likely to escalate, although there were few craft gin makers who have reached any serious scale.

Forsyth said major spirit companies were moving to buy out producers at a relatively early stage in their development, after letting craft beer startups gain market share before they began buying them up.

But he added: “It’s a risky thing to do as the younger consumer really demands authenticity from a brand. Sipsmith is still playing on its craft and smaller size and there’s a real disconnect with being part of one of the major spirits companies in the world.”

Galsworthy said he was confident that Beam Suntory would give the brand real independence and it would continue to produce its gin in exactly the same manner. He said he was “committed for life” to Sipsmith and while the current staff and founding shareholders, who include family and friends, would no longer hold shares in the company they had agreed long-term financial incentives so they could share in its future success.

Matt Shattock, chairman and chief executive of Beam Suntory, said: “We really admire what [Sipsmith has] accomplished, and we’re very excited to team up with them to maximise the global potential of Sipsmith.”

Gin is thought to have been first produced in Italy, but gained popularity as a medicine in early 17th-century Holland.

“Genever” was used a treatment for stomach complaints, gout and gallstones. It was flavoured with juniper to improve the taste and add medicinal properties.

Gin was popularised in the UK via British troops who were given the spirit as “Dutch courage” during the 30 years’ war. But the industry really boomed in the early 1700s after King William III loosened regulation.

Gin became so widely consumed that the amount sold daily began to exceed that of beer. It was a cheap drink drunk by the poor.

Attempts to control the market in the 1730s led to riots and failed to put a lid on growing sales. In 1750 the Gin Act finally restricted distribution by licensing spirit retailers. Hogarth’s famous print Gin Lane, produced in 1751, showed the dangers of addiction to the spirit.

Gin’s image first began to change in the 1850s when distillers opened gin palaces, luxurious drinking establishments designed to entice more well-off patrons. The gin and tonic was also born as Brits in colonial India mixed the spirit with sugar and lime to make taking quinine for malaria more palatable. Gin reached the peak of sophistication when mixed with vermouth to create the martini cocktail, chosen by Ian Fleming as the drink of choice – with vodka and shaken, not stirred – for James Bond .

Two weeks ago, he was a chicken fan with a tiny YouTube following. Now, he has a manager, millions of fans and a secret plan for world domination. But the Chicken Connoisseur has zero appetite for discussing his age. Is he a teenager, as many assumed when his video reviews of London chicken shops went viral last week? With boyish features and dressed in his Sunday best, the then-unnamed critic attracted millions of hits. But then, in a tweeted – and now deleted – reply to the question of age, he said he was 23.

“I don’t really see that there’s much of a need to confirm it,” says Elijah Quashie, in a phone interview arranged by his manager and old friend Marwan Elgamal. Quashie is promoting episode seven of Pengest Munch, which you can watch below, in which the Chicken Connoisseur goes to North Finchley. “To be honest, I can’t remember what I tweeted or didn’t tweet – a lot’s been going on,” he says.

Quashie, from Tottenham, north London, realised things were exploding when his phone started buzzing while he sat on a train. Until a little over a week ago, his videos had about 700 views each. His YouTube channel, which he started in August 2015, had 150 subscribers. At the time of writing, the videos now have about a million views each and the channel almost a quarter of a million subscribers.

“My head is still spinning,” Quashie says. “Before, I might have had a lie-in, take my time and go and make some jam and peanut butter sandwiches. Now it’s this interview, or this thing. It’s been hectic. But it’s kind of what I wanted, just not necessarily at this scale.”

Quashie attributes his unexpected fame to “the bald one on MasterChef”. Last year, he was idly watching Gregg Wallace judging a plate of food. “I wondered to myself, what makes his opinion more valued than anyone else’s? Is it because he’s been eating more food, so he has an experienced palate? I’m not sure. I thought, no one is doing this for the type of people who eat at chicken shops.”

Chicken shops have become integral to communities across our cities. “This isn’t me being cliched, but I genuinely don’t know what life would be like without them,” Quashie says. “When I link up with my friends, we go to the chicken shop and eat and chill. If not there, we might end up going to someone’s house but then someone has to cook and it’s a bit long.”

Quashie, who has always been the class joker, is unimpressed by the more recent rise of high-end pretenders, including Chicken Shop, the Soho House chain. “If I want to spend £10 on chicken, I’ll go to my local bossman and feed five people,” he says. For Quashie, shops live or die by price, but he says that lighting and seating arrangements are also vital. “These things affect the mood of the place,” he adds.

The suits he wears while reviewing (typical line: “The burger caught me off-guard, ’cos it was hench … man definitely chewed on a bone”) are his church clothes. “I thought it was funny, because people might demean chicken shops,” Quashie says, “but it’s just as much a restaurant.”

The videos, made by Elishama Udorok, a filmmaker friend of Quashie’s, went viral when the sixth episode took off on Reddit and Twitter. Now Quashie, a former shoe-shop worker with a collection of 40 pairs of rare trainers, is getting recognised on the street. Recently, he says, a paramedic shouted at him from an ambulance, insisting that his local Chick-King could not be matched.

Quashie tries to limit chicken shop meals to one or two a week. “Before this thing blew up, I was thinking I might need to cut down to get my diet on point, but now …” he says. “But most of the time I’m eating jollof rice or a bit of plantain.” He also has plans to leverage his burgeoning fame into a new project. As to what that might be, though, he wants to keep fans guessing. “We’re talking about expensive intellectual property, so I will keep it under wraps,” he says.

The Christmas countdown has started, and to avoid the usual last-minute fluster, I’m trying to plan ahead. Knowing what we’re going to eat next weekend and beyond means I can get some cooking done early. It also limits panic buys: every year, I never think we have enough food in, but there’s always way too much. I’m making this comforting and inexpensive Persian rice for Christmas Eve, most of which can be made ahead; and a light salad for the evening after the big lunch.

This is the type of dish you can eat with a spoon while curled up in a heap or when celebrating around a crowded table. Serves four to six.

6 medium-sized squid

100g brown lentils

200g basmati rice, soaked for 1 hour

6 tbsp olive oil

2 small white onions, peeled and finely chopped

80g sultanas, soaked in boiling water for 10 minutes

1 tsp turmeric

1 stick cinnamon

1 pinch saffron threads, soaked in 100ml warm water

For the onions

150ml vegetable oil

2 white onions, peeled and finely sliced

For the dressing

1 orange

1 lemon

½ small bunch parsley, leaves picked and finely chopped

1 small bunch dill, finely chopped

1 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil

Cut down one side of each squid and open it out. Scrape out any gunk, then wash. Score the inside surface in a criss-cross pattern, but don’t cut all the way through, then refrigerate.

Warm the oil for the onions in a deep pan (or wok) on a medium-low heat, and sweat the onions, stirring often, for 30-40 minutes, until golden and crisp. Transfer to a plate lined with kitchen paper.

Put the lentils and rice in separate small pans, cover both with water, season with salt and bring to a boil. Cook the rice for 10 minutes, drain and leave uncovered to steam dry. Let the lentils cook for 10-15 minutes longer, until just cooked, then drain and steam dry in the same way.

Warm half the olive oil in a casserole and sweat the chopped onions on medium heat for 10 minutes, until soft. Add the sultanas, turmeric and cinnamon, cook for five minutes, then stir into the lentils.

For the dressing, grate the orange and lemon zest into a bowl, then add the onion mix and the herbs. Cut off and discard the lemon pith, roughly chop the flesh, stir this into the salad mix, and season to taste. This can all be done ahead of time.

Just before serving, wipe clean the casserole, add the remaining oil and put on a medium heat. Spoon in half the rice in an even layer, then top with half the lentils, and repeat until both are used up. Poke holes all over the top layer of lentils, and pour the saffron water into the indents. Cover the pan with a clean tea towel and a lid, pulling the towel up and over the lid, to keep it away from the heat source, and cook on a medium heat for 25 minutes, until the bottom layer of rice is golden and crisp.

Five minutes before the rice is done, heat a griddle until smoking hot. Rub the squid in a little oil, salt and pepper, then lay it unscored side down on the griddle, pressing it flat with a fish slice. Cook for a minute a side, then cut into big chunks.

Spoon the rice and lentils on to a platter, scraping the bottom to get all those lovely crunchy bits. Scatter over the squid, spoon on the dressing and top with the onions. Serve hot.

Grilling gives the pears a lovely smokiness, while the dressing adds a sparkling acidity. Serves four to six.

1 small shallot, peeled and finely sliced

2 tbsp sherry vinegar

4 firm pears, cut lengthways into 2cm slices

50g blue cheese (gorgonzola or stilton)

Juice of 1 small lemon

2 tsp creme fraiche

2-3 sprigs tarragon, leaves picked and finely chopped

5 tbsp olive oil

300g radicchio, chicory and watercress leaves, washed and dried

Put the shallot and vinegar in a small bowl, stir and leave to macerate while you get on with the everything else.

Heat a griddle until smoking hot (or heat a grill to its highest setting), then grill the pear slices for two to three minutes a side, until lightly charred, but not cooking them so much that the fruit falls apart. Set aside to cool.

Meanwhile, put the nuts, sugar, pimentón and butter in a small saucepan on a medium-high heat and cook, stirring, for five minutes until the butter and sugar have melted and coated the nuts. Tip out on to a plate covered in greaseproof paper, and separate the nuts a little, so they don’t stick together too much as they cool.

For the dressing, mash the cheese and lemon with a fork, until smoothish, stir in the creme fraiche and tarragon, then slowly whisk in the oil until emulsified and thick. Season to taste. Rip the leaves into random shapes and sizes, and arrange on a platter. Sit the pears on top, followed by the shallots. Break up the nuts with your hands, sprinkle all over the top, then spoon on the dressing and serve at once.

If, like me, you over-order blue cheese at Christmas, don’t worry. Beaten into an equal amount of mascarpone, it makes a glorious filling for mini cheese scones. Or add some to a rarebit mixture made with strong cheddar or Lincolnshire poacher, for the perfect simple and quick supper. Or use it up in a cheese soufflé. Whizz leftover tarragon with parsley to make a fast salsa verde. And sprinkle excess crisp onions on just about anything.

Soju, the world’s bestselling alcohol, is a rice-based Korean hooch that packs a fair punch. That said, it is almost Christmas, so you could use St Germain instead of the cordial to make this even boozier. Serves one.

Shake the soju, cordial, Cointreau, citrus and egg in a shaker, add ice and shake again. Strain into a coupe glass, add a drop of bitters and serve.

What’s going for it? Those wily French! No sooner had they stormed the Bastille than they had designs on storming us. Again. The last invasion of Britain took place on 22 February 1797, just outside Fishguard, though it seems more omnishambles than shock and awe. Two of the three prongs of attack were scuppered by bad weather; the third was marred by a right old shower. Many opted to get drunk and loot farmhouses; the rest were seen off after a couple of days by reservists and locals, including folk heroine Jemima Nicholas who, it’s reputed, rounded up a dozen Frenchies with nothing more than a pitchfork. That’s the spirit. After which Fishguard and its mini-me Newport returned to business as usual, catching herring and supping ale. Today, they’re rather idyllic, with their boats bobbing in the harbour, their wooded slopes and tranquil beaches, while tourists and downshifters hungry for the Pembrokeshire Experience invade Tenby and the south coast, armed with selfie sticks and demands for artisan ice-cream.

The case against They’re remote, but that kind of goes with the territory.

Well connected? There’s a station, but few trains: three a day to Carmarthen (50 mins), a couple of direct trains a day to Cardiff (2-3hrs). Driving: half-hour drives to Haverfordwest and St David’s, an hour to Carmarthen, 90 mins to Swansea. Buses to Haverfordwest, Cardigan and St David’s.

Schools Primaries: Fishguard’s Glannau Gwaun and Holy Name Catholic are “adequate”, Newport’s Bro Ingli is “good”, Estyn says. Secondaries: Fishguard’s Bro Gwaun is “adequate”.

Hang out at… Cnapan or the Golden Lion, both in Newport; the Fishguard Arms or the Royal Oak in Fishguard, where the Frenchies got drunk.

Where to buy Fishguard is a game of three halves: the pretty Lower Town down on the harbour, all wooded slopes, pebbledashed cottages, slipways and seaweed; the main town up the hill, with fine sea views, whitewashed or brightly painted town houses and terraces; and Goodwick, home to the ferry and train station, and a more humdrum affair. Newport, on the other side of Dinas Head, is smaller and quieter, straggly with old stone houses tumbling to the beach. Large detacheds and town houses, £300,000-£400,000. Detacheds and smaller town houses, £150,000-£300,000. Semis, £110,000-£250,000. Terraces and cottages, £80,000-£125,000. The rental market is teeny.

Phil Rowson “The Cambo pub, short for Cambrian: a proper local for young and old, families, regulars and drop-ins.”

Angela Griffiths “The Gourmet Pig deli for Welsh cheeses, wines and beer – they serve great coffee, too. The Royal Oak pub has a fantastic folk night every Tuesday.”

A group of British modelling agencies that represent names including Yasmin Le Bon, Sophie Dahl and Stella Tennant have been fined £1.5m for colluding to fix prices charged to retailers, fashion brands and other customers.

The UK competition regulator has fined FM Models, Models 1, Premier, Storm and Viva, along with industry trade body the Association of Model Agents (AMA), for price-fixing modelling services for at least two years from March 2013.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) found that the agencies and their association “systematically exchanged information and discussed prices”, in some cases agreeing to fix minimum prices or agree a common approach to pricing.



The price collusion affected customers including high street chains, online fashion retailers and consumer goods brands that use models to front their products and appear in ad campaigns.



The regulator’s investigation looked into pricing practices across a broad spectrum of modelling assignments, from fashion magazine shoots offering models fees of a few hundred pounds to ad campaigns offering more than £10,000.



The CMA said that the collusion and price fixing did not extend to the services of so-called “top models”.



The fine and ruling is hugely damaging to the reputation of the modelling agencies and their industry. Premier represented Naomi Campbell for 17 years, while Storm discovered Kate Moss and Cara Delevingne, although all three are now with other agencies. Models 1 represents Sophie Dahl and Yasmin Le Bon, while Viva’s models include Stella Tennant and Natalia Vodianova.

The two biggest fines were charged to Storm (£491,000) and Models One (£394,000). FM Models, which has been given a £251,00 fine, shut down earlier this year.



Models 1, Premier and Storm said in a joint statement that they intended to appeal against the ruling. “The CMA’s findings are wholly mistaken,” the agencies said.

The agencies said the CMA has failed to understand the role of the modelling agency, which is in part to protect the interests of models. They said their actions were not designed to force up or fix prices but to “protect the interests of models and also ensure a sustainable market which benefits customers, the economy and society”.



“We reached our decision to appeal the CMA’s findings without hesitation,” said John Horner, the managing director of Models 1. “The CMA is penalising modelling agencies for seeking to maintain professional standards within the industry whilst also protecting the interests of young and vulnerable people.”



Le Bon credited the AMA with “nurturing and protecting” her at the beginning of her career and said it “taught [me] how to become the model I am today”.



“Had it not been for the knowledge, experience and professionalism of the agency I would not have sustained a career in the industry,” she said. “It takes time and commitment to build a career and the AMA, with its agents, have always sought to protect young models from exploitation, but also from clients who are under pressure to pay increasingly low fees.”



Storm model Hannah Cassidy said the AMA’s guidance had been “essential because the pressure and dangers of exploitation are real”.



“I have benefited from their experience in negotiating rates, working conditions, terms and image use,” she said. “Agents promote but also protect models from unfair contract and exclusivity terms which could harm their careers. They also make sure I get paid on time.”



Viva, which was fined £245,000, also strenuously denies wrongdoing.

“Viva strongly denies it agreed to fix minimum prices or that it agreed a common approach to pricing,” said a spokeswoman for the agency. “To date, the CMA has produced no evidence to demonstrate that the conduct which is the subject of the CMA’s Decision had any effect on the rates models represented by Viva received for assignments; this is because it did not have any such effect.”

The CMA said that the AMA and the agencies also sought to influence other members of the industry body by regularly issuing email circulars, known as AMA Alerts, urging them to resist the prices offered by customers on the grounds they were too low.



“When businesses collude rather than compete the ultimate losers are customers,” said John Wotton, the chair of the Case Decision Group at the CMA, which made the decision. “This type of behaviour harms the economy and deprives businesses and consumers of the benefits of competition.”

Could having fun in middle age help you live longer? A study from University College London, tracking 9,000 people over four years, has found that enjoying life and having a positive outlook in your 50s is linked to longevity. We asked people over 50 how they keep their happiness levels up.

Deb: Doing things separately away from family is good. Having lots of grown-up girly time. Now our children are grown up, it’s easier to fit in socialising. We get together at the weekends and sleep over. Our families benefit because we’re happy – we have free time away from them and we go home relaxed. It’s good to get away from normal day-to-day routine, just being ourselves. I forget how old I am. I definitely have more fun now than I did when I was 20 or 30. My life seems fuller, a better quality of life. Sometimes it is hard to keep in touch with friends. But you have to make time, and take the time out.

Sally: I love my allotment, which I’ve had for about five years. It’s fresh air, and I love the view. It’s quiet and peaceful – it’s “my time”. Friends and family are important. We have a friend who has MS and it makes us realise what we can do and she can’t anymore.

Julie: Days meeting up with friends make me happy. We’ve had the most wonderful time, reliving our teenage years! We went to see the Bay City Rollers, our 1970s heroes – we’ve seen them three times. Such good fun. It takes us back. I have more fun now. Back then you worried about how you looked, but now you’re just relaxed.

Stephen: I’ve just taken six months unpaid leave to go out and start trying to enjoy things. It’s like a pre-retirement, to get used to it. And to spend more time as a couple, doing things we enjoy. We took the whole family – our three children, their partners and our grandchild – on holiday to Florida. We spent a week in Disneyland and a week on the coast. And now we’re planning our next holiday in Malaysia.



Loraine: My family is key to my happiness. My granddaughter is just so gorgeous. I used to look after her for one day a week because everyone was at work. I haven’t changed that much now I’m older. I don’t go out to discos now, but I do still like to dance. I’m looking forward to Steve retiring, as I’ve been home alone for three years.



I’ve got four kids, who I brought up myself, and five grandchildren. They’re my joy. For fun, I love travelling, and I’ve been to amazing places. I was really happy when I walked the Great Wall of China.

London’s tough. It’s a hard city to live in. My balance is going back to Sheffield and seeing my kids – then I’m happy. And no, I’m not worried about smoking. You’re going to die from something, right?

I stay happy playing cricket, watching cricket, or playing football. I think friendly competition gives me happiness. The same things that got me going in my youth keep me going now: achievement in sport, but also in work.

In work it’s winning research grants and consultant contracts, and publishing a good paper that’s well read gives me a kick. I think if you follow what you’re good at and what you enjoy doing, and make that your career, then you’re having fun and getting paid for it.

As I’ve got older, I’ve learned that mood has much more to do with the machine of your body rather than how you think. If you get the sun on your skin, talk to another human being, use your body and wear it out a bit each day, eat good food and sleep, I think it’s impossible to feel depressed. I live on a boat and so I spend a lot of my life sitting outside. And because I run a bookshop from it, I spend a lot of my time talking to other people.

Most of my socialising and having fun when I was younger was a way to meet girls. When your testosterone levels calm a little bit, it’s like like the sun falls and all the stars become visible. Softer things like live music and reading books seem to be immensely pleasing things. The most fun I have is with the guy I run the bookshop with. Having a creative thing to do with someone else is another secret of happiness, because there’s always someone to motivate you when you’re feeling flat.

I will be 28 at the end of this year, and I am feeling very anxious about the next stage of my life.

I am generally very sociable, and have built a wide circle of friends. However, lately, I have found that many of my friends are in committed, settled relationships, and I worry that I have nothing in common with my peers any more. I am grateful to have had three romantic relationships in my 20s, although none of these have worked out. I have considered dating, but I find that a lot of men my age and older are more interested in women who are in their early 20s. This has surprised me and made me feel insecure about searching for a partner.

I lived in a different city when I went to university, and I have been lucky to have visited several countries all over the world throughout my life, but now I am working in a career in the city I was born in, and I feel very restless and unmotivated. I have considered moving abroad, but I am lucky to have the job that I have and I am not sure it would be productive to leave it.

I am also concerned that I would face the same challenges abroad, such as having things in common with peers who are in settled relationships. I am not sure that I am happy with the way that my life has gone over the past decade, and I am worried it is too late to do anything meaningful or exciting. I can appreciate that I have my health and that I have a lot of life left to live, but I can’t shake this feeling of dread and anxiety about what is coming next.

It’s not uncommon when friends go through stages you are not sharing with them (new job, relationships, new baby, etc) to feel a bit adrift, left out, left behind – no one likes this feeling. And I think your 20s is when this happens a lot, and it can leave you feeling really disoriented. But unless the friendship is very transient (and some friendships are, but that doesn’t mean they’re not valuable for the time they last), you should be able to meet one another on the other side. After all, you will one day go through a life stage that your friends aren’t going through and they may feel like this. What’s important is to look for the landmarks of similarity, rather than where you diverge.

I consulted Andy Cottom, a psychotherapist (ukcp.org.uk), who wonders “who made up the rules that you’re trying to follow? The expectations of stages in life: school, university, buy a house, settle down? You seem to be at a stage where your friends are settling down, but perhaps you don’t want to?”

If I were to tell you that, actually, you will get all the things you want (whatever they are) later, what would you do with this stage of your life? Of course, I can’t guarantee anything, but it’s a useful exercise to think like this. Because if you could be sure you would, for example, settle down (this is the thing you seem to have mentioned the most, that other people are doing and you are not) – how would you view this period in your life now? Would you not, actually, be able to enjoy the freedom and independence more, instead of worrying about what will happen next. Are you not, perhaps, more worried and anxious about what won’t happen, rather than what is happening?

You mention being back in the city you were born in – was that a fall-back decision or a positive one? You present this as if it were a step backwards, as if everyone else is moving forward but you are not. I don’t think that’s accurate because you are not comparing like with like. Can you pinpoint why you are unmotivated? Did you feel unmotivated before “all your friends started settling down” – have their choices made you look more acutely on your own? It is hard not to be swayed by what’s happening around you but I wonder what grounds you? (Family? No mention of them.)

If you could tap more into what makes you feel safe – in this period of what you feel to be instability – it might give you a chance to zone into what it is that you really want. Maybe moving cities and jobs is the right thing to do, but you should do it because you want to, because it’s right for you – not as a reaction to what is happening with your friends.

Did something particular trigger this feeling of dread and anxiety? Can you trace it back to a particular event and, if so, could you examine what this represents to you?

You know, there may be someone in your circle right now looking at you and thinking how much you’ve got going for you, because nothing is ever as it seems and all those people around you who seem to have it so sorted – they haven’t. You are not quite 28; you say yourself that you have a lot of life left to live – you do! You have the whole of the rest of your life to do something “meaningful and exciting” or just meaningful and very ordinary, if that’s what you choose to do.

Cottom advises you to “have more confidence in your abilities. Don’t be frightened by the freedom you have.”

At what age are you too old to achieve breakthrough success in your field? That question fascinates so many people, I suspect, because almost nobody considers themselves already entirely successful. The unpublished novelist longs to be published, the published one yearns for bestsellerdom, the bestselling superstar craves the Booker prize. (Also, everyone always thinks they’re just a few years from being “over the hill”. The web is cluttered with listicles offering the supposedly reassuring information that, say, JK Rowling wasn’t a publishing sensation until, well, her early 30s.)
