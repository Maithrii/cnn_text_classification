Certain family court hearings to take place in public in radical trial
###########################################################
Family court hearings are to be held in public for the first time, in a radical trial being pursued by the leading family judge for England and Wales, the Guardian understands.

Sir James Munby, the president of the family division of the high court, is to continue far-reaching reforms to bring more transparency to the system in 2017 by launching a trial in which some types of hearings would be held in public. 



It is expected appropriate orders will remain in place to protect the identities of the participants. A separate plan is being considered to allow the media access to documents from hearings that have previously been kept secret.

Women who have suffered domestic violence and experienced the family courts broke the ban on discussing their cases to reveal to the Guardian how they believe the secrecy of the system allows them to be further abused by ex-partners.

Claire Waxman, of Voice4Victims, who campaigns to highlight abuse of process within the family and civil courts, welcomed moves to increase the openness of the court system. “We would support the increase of transparency in the family courts,” she said. “We are seeing far too many victims of stalking and domestic violence being exposed to unnecessary risk and harm in these court proceedings.”

But Munby’s changes are likely to be opposed by much of the legal profession working within the family division.

Joanne Edwards, former chair of Resolution, the national family law association, and head of family law at Forsters, said: “There is pretty widespread, if not universal, opposition to the public hearing pilot which is being suggested and to the release of court documents to members of the press.



“There is strong opposition to any further opening up of the court amongst the professions. For us it is about safeguarding the interests of children who, unlike in criminal proceedings, invariably become embroiled in family proceedings through no fault of their own. There is a real risk of jigsaw identification and once details of their private family life are out there, they can never be retrieved. The resulting harm to children can be profound.”

Family courts, which deal with issues such as divorce, financial provision for children, contact with children, adoption and local authority intervention to protect children, were opened to the media in 2009, but hearings largely remain secret. Judges can limit media attendance, there are tight restrictions on what – if anything – can be reported, the media have no access to documents and can be ordered to leave the court on the decision of the judge or magistrate.

Munby consulted closely with senior lawyers in Australia, where family courts have been held in open hearings for the last 30 years, before launching the reforms. He has said pursuing further transparency in family courts is a subject close to his heart.

He issued guidance in January 2014 aimed at encouraging judges to publish their judgments on the judicial website Bailii in redacted and anonymised forms to protect the identities of children. But the guidance only applied to the top level of judges and in the vast majority of family cases heard by district judges and magistrates, judgments are not published.

According to Ministry of Justice figures, 225,590 cases were completed in the family court in 2015, almost half of which were divorce cases. In the same year, judges published 469 judgments on Bailii.

Prof Julie Doughty, lecturer in law at Cardiff University, who is being funded by Nuffield to research transparency in the family courts, said current measures did not go far enough. “The judicial guidance of 2014 hasn’t ended the perception and allegations of secrecy in the family courts,” she said. “I don’t think you get transparency through publishing judgments on Bailii. To get transparency you have to present it in a way people can understand and make sense of quickly. Bailii does not really help the system become more transparent at all.”

In a consultation document issued to lawyers in 2014, called Transparency: the next steps, Munby acknowledged the profession’s “nervousness” about further moves to increase transparency. But he said there was a need for greater openness to improve public understanding of the court process and confidence in the court system. “The public has a legitimate interest in being able to read what is being done by the judges in its name,” he told lawyers.

He is likely to announce progress in the new year on the two key reforms in the consultation document: a pilot of family hearings being held in public, and the release of documents to the media. The latter will include case summaries, skeleton arguments of the case, documents which are issued during fact-finding hearings – for example where allegations of domestic violence have been made – and experts’ reports, to allow the media to perform their watchdog role in society, he said.

Munby has already canvassed initial views on the public hearings and if he gives the go-ahead for the trial, it will go out to further consultation with the profession.

But responses to his consultation were almost universally hostile. The proposals were rejected by the Association of Lawyers for Children, which has 1,400 members, the Family Law Bar Association, Resolution, the national family lawyers’ association, and Family Justice Young People’s Board, a group of young people who have had direct experience of the family justice system.

Cris McCurley, a family lawyer who specialises in representing black and minority ethnic women in cases involving extreme domestic violence, said holding hearings in open court could stop vulnerable women taking part in hearings. “Family courts hear intimate personal details and even with anonymity imposed I think the particulars of cases would be identifiable certainly within their communities,” she said. “My worry is it would stop women coming forward to seek help to protect their children.”

Lucy Reed, a family law barrister, who runs the Transparency Project, which aims to increase understanding of the system, said opening up the courts further should be an issue for parliament to discuss.



A spokesman for the judicial communications office said Munby intended to issue further guidance on the issues raised in his August 2014 consultation on transparency in the new year.

One day in early August, 36-year-old Gavin bumped into an old friend outside That’s Entertainment music and DVD shop in Preston market.

“He pulled me to one side, but I didn’t recognise him,” Gavin (a pseudonym) says when we meet a week later. “He was like, ‘How you doing? I’m just going to get some stuff, make some money.’ He’s opened his bag and it’s full of razor blades. He’s selling razor blades for a tenner a pop, all of that business.”

Gavin says that he and the man were former “grafting partners”: commercial burglars and thieves, working around Lancashire. But in the six years since they had last seen one another, their lives had taken divergent paths.

“He’s ended up on the gear, shoplifting,” Gavin says. “I was like, ‘See you later mate.’ I felt guilty, tight, leaving him, but I thought: ‘What would happen if I’m with him and he gets pulled over and I’m in the hospital?’ I’d be in a lot of trouble, wouldn’t I? I gave him a couple of quid to buy himself a couple of pies, a cup of tea, and he wandered off … I sat there and thought: ‘If I’d not been in here, it’d be me doing that.’”

Gavin relates the story inside a meeting room at Guild Lodge hospital, in the Lancashire village of Whittingham, where he has lived for the past three years. Guild Lodge is one of 60 medium-secure mental health hospitals in England and Wales that house people deemed to be a danger either to themselves or others on account of their mental illness. Most of the 149 patients have committed offences while mentally ill, or have been diagnosed with a mental illness while already in prison. Some have been in higher-security institutions; almost all are being held under the terms of the Mental Health Act.

Gavin, who has schizophrenia, describes a life of substance abuse and crime, sometimes with violence, that took him in and out of prison and secure care settings for the past 18 years – his entire adult life. He was most recently admitted to a medium-secure ward at Guild Lodge in 2013, and is now in low-secure, from which he is permitted release to go into town, as he waits first for a tribunal hearing that could clear him for discharge and then, crucially, for a bed in supported accommodation.

“It might not work if I was just kicked out like I was in the prison system. I would have nowhere to go,” Gavin says. “I’d be on the street, in a hostel, back in crime or something. When I’ve been released from prison, it’s been a few weeks at the most. I’ve been straight back in for something else.”

From 1873 until 1995, the leafy park that surrounds Guild Lodge’s complex of modern buildings concealed Whittingham Hospital, which was Britain’s largest psychiatric institution and a centrepiece of the notorious Victorian asylum system. But Guild Lodge, which opened in 1999, is a striking representation of the advancements in secure-care provision across the UK – particularly at a security level one step below Broadmoor, Ashworth and Rampton, England’s three high-secure forensic psychiatric services.

From the outside, the pale bricks and long windows of the medium-secure area of Guild Lodge could pass for a leisure centre. Even the high mesh fence that surrounds it could be for tennis courts or a five-a-side football pitch. The low-secure area that sprawls outside looks and feels like a business park. There is little to distinguish buildings containing administration offices and meeting rooms from the wards in which patients sleep.

Service users (the preferred term for patient) considered low-risk are free to wander through the adjacent woodland, around an Anglican church, a cemetery and even a cricket pitch. One service user, who told me he spends much of his days watching wildlife and listening to music on a wind-up radio, insisted that a relative of local hero Andrew Flintoff was the groundsman.

As with all hospitals, the aim is that patients will one day be discharged from Guild Lodge with their illnesses under control. It is recovery-focused rather than punitive, and although the Ministry of Justice retains a controlling interest in the onward progression of many patients (some will go back to prison), funding for medium-secure hospitals comes entirely from NHS England’s special commissioning budget.

The unique challenge is to balance care with custody; to maintain the public’s security while effectively treating patients’ illnesses. For thousands of people like Gavin, who is genial, articulate and rational when his schizophrenia is under control, secure care units can prove the difference between what might be considered a worthwhile life, and one wasted as hostage to an unpredictable and often dangerous illness.

Such endeavours are not cheap. According to figures from NHS England, expenditure on medium- and high-secure mental health services during the past year was £1.23bn, which accounts for 74% of the special commissioning budget and is one fifth of all public spending on adult mental health care. Accurate figures on a patient-by-patient basis are difficult to obtain, but conservative estimates put the cost of a bed and care for a year in a medium-secure hospital at £150,000, nearly five times as much as a male inmate in a category B prison.

Partly because of their cost, forensic psychiatry hospitals are under almost constant review. Medium-secure services in particular have remained a focal point for mental health campaigners, who say patients are often too readily admitted to an unnecessarily high level of security and then stay too long. The most recent government taskforce report on mental health – titled Five Year Forward View for Mental Health, released in February – made fresh commitments to “prevent avoidable admissions”, support recovery in the “least restrictive setting” and “address existing fragmented pathways in secure care”. In essence, it emphasises a need to get patients hastily into secure care when mental illness is the root cause of their offending, but also to discharge them quickly and safely, with adequate continued care, to get on with their lives.

Yet there remain frequent claims that the Ministry of Justice is overly cautious in approving discharge from secure hospitals, and that there is inadequate onward housing provision for patients reintegrating into communities. In general, treatment for mental illness has progressed significantly since the days of the asylums, but age-old misconceptions persist about psychiatric institutions. Patients still suffer familiar prejudice on account of their illness, compounded by their detention in hospital.

“It’s very, very risk-averse stuff,” says Jenny Shaw, the recently retired clinical director for specialist services at Lancashire Care Foundation Trust, which oversees Guild Lodge. “Even having conversations with some of my friends, who should know better, [I hear] ‘How can you ever let people who have committed those kinds of offences out?’ It’s a complete lack of understanding of what we’re trying to do. I think there’s still a massive stigma around mental health, and people with mental health problems and who are offenders – it’s a massive double whammy.”

I visited Guild Lodge twice earlier this year, touring the medium-secure unit and talking to some service users about treatment programmes and the challenges they face. Journalists are rarely permitted inside secure care environments: service users are often vulnerable and their recovery programmes easily undermined by external distractions. Administrators are also wary of the sensationalist reporting mental health hospitals have been known to attract, while victims and their families stand to gain little by repeated exposure to the perpetrators of the crimes against them. All names have therefore been changed and details of offences omitted.

In general, people who have committed offences as a result of a mental illness tend to be blighted by extreme guilt for their actions. Many people hear voices or suffer delusions that have encouraged their offences. Hospitals house people suffering from a vast range of illnesses – schizophrenia, psychosis, acute depression, bipolar disorder – from hugely varying backgrounds, many of whom have suffered extreme trauma. The propensity to self-harm is also high.

The area “over the fence” – as one service user described the medium-secure part of the hospital – has the atmosphere of a vocational college, albeit one in which most doors are permanently locked. Staff and visitors pass through an air-lock security door, past a small office where patients can meet guests, and then into a courtyard, with various separate buildings situated either side of an access road and areas of green lawns. After appropriate risk assessment, service users are allowed access to an art room and wood and metal-working workshops, or to learn gardening skills in an on-site greenhouse and nursery. There is also a music room, and a service-user band regularly plays gigs both in and outside the hospital.

My visit to the medium-secure unit coincided with lunch, when the common areas were almost entirely deserted. Patients were in gender-specific wards, where they sleep in single-occupancy rooms, with washing facilities, and are locked in overnight. Although neither staff nor service users denied that tempers can flare, and that patients’ moods and illnesses can often raise tensions inside the hospital, I saw no threatening behaviour. Patients at different stages of recovery demand varying levels of supervision, but I met service users for interview in the low-secure area to which they brought themselves and left unescorted.

Many patients in secure care have co-morbidity issues – drug or alcohol misuse, or personality disorders – and programmes work to tackle these, as well as to improve patients’ physical health. Smoking is entirely prohibited inside Guild Lodge, and service users are encouraged to use an on-site gym and sports hall. Weight gain remains one of the most damaging side-effects of many psychotropic medications, leading both to physical ailments and reduced self-esteem.

Guild Lodge is also relatively unusual in that its administrators have won a battle to permit computer use for service users. Access to technology brings out the most risk-averse tendencies of lawmakers, who fear that vulnerable patients may be drawn to the darkest fringes of the internet. (Mobile phones are also strictly forbidden.) But a lack of even rudimentary IT skills may be damaging to a patient’s prospects of reintegrating to the job market on release. Service users can suffer an extreme sense of isolation, as though they are separate from the community in which they hope to reintegrate. Any further barriers, such as a lack of basic skills, only compound anxiety issues surrounding discharge.

One low-secure service user named Janet, who was not at Guild Lodge and who met me in a coffee shop in London, described a scenario where she was required to go online to arrange her own onward housing in order to be discharged from a hospital, but was not permitted access to the internet before she left.

“In the five years I’ve been in hospital, the world has moved a lot,” Janet says. “One of the people I live with has been in hospital for 16 years. She is about to be discharged and she has got no concept of how to use the internet. None at all.”

She adds: “No matter how confident you are as an individual, your confidence just plummets. Even the most arrogant individuals in hospital – it’s quite interesting watching them go out into the community, all that arrogance and bravado seems to quite quickly crumble. It’s fearful. We have a bridge at the front of the hospital. It’s called ‘life beyond the bridge’. Patients fear crossing that bridge.”

In recent years, studies into the effectiveness of treatments for mental illness, including schizophrenia, have centred on involving patients themselves in planning their own recovery. Research has shown that patients respond better to treatment when they are engaged in it and given more control over the direction of their own care.

In the secure environment, attempts to empower patients in this way can be seen to run counter to the demands of security, but initiatives are now in place that focus on service-user involvement and are aimed at hastening recovery and expediting discharge. “These things are related,” says Ian Callaghan, a former service user, with experience of both low- and medium-secure hospitals, who now works for Rethink Mental Illness. “As soon as a person’s mental health is stabilised, things should change. Stabilising mental health and managing risk go hand-in-hand.”

Callaghan is the national service user lead for a Department of Health initiative named My Shared Pathway – a programme followed throughout a patient’s stay in hospital. My Shared Pathway is tailored to an individual’s specific needs and defines closely their shared relationships with the clinicians, support workers, other service users and eventually the community they hope to return to. Meanwhile, a scheme launched by Rethink Mental Illness’ Innovation Network is aiming to involve service users in planning their futures in a far more detailed way than has been the norm.

These initiatives aren’t to everyone’s taste. One 57-year-old service user, who had spent many years in Ashworth high-secure hospital before transferring to Guild Lodge seven years ago, said: “They have meetings about when to organise meetings.” The same service user was also not a supporter of the smoking prohibition, and said fellow patients squirrelled cigarettes just outside the fence.

Nevertheless, initial feedback from staff and patients has mainly been good, and further trials are also currently under way to enhance the role of peer-support workers in secure hospitals. The idea is that experienced service users can volunteer their support and advice to other patients, building on informal relationships on some wards and broadening networks of trusted individuals. Service users are known to respond well to people who have been through the secure-care system and have successfully returned to the community. Janet says: “It does sometimes take somebody who has recovered to let you see the light a little bit.”

Service users and staff both told me that it can be detrimental to recovery if, after being cleared for discharge by a clinician, a patient is denied release either by the Ministry of Justice, or by a lack of onward accommodation provision. After the taskforce recommendations, NHS England is trialling a reorganisation of budgets to allow local administrators to manage pathways out of hospital and into community mental health care teams. The aim is that medium-secure services be used only to address the most pressing clinical needs, rather than by patients for whom there is simply nowhere else to go.

Gavin says that the severity of his illness did not allow him to understand the benefit of his treatment during previous admissions to secure hospital. He returned to the prison system and stopped taking medication, leading to a deterioration in his condition. (Prisoners can reject medication, but some sections of the Mental Health Act, under which service users will be in hospital, allow for doctors to administer it without consent.) Eventually, after returning again to secure care, a course of therapy helped him manage his illness and turn over a new leaf.

“You get to a certain point where [you think], ‘What’s been going on? What have I been doing with my life?’” he says. “I just want to leave now. I don’t smoke anymore, I’ve not done drugs, I’ve not drunk alcohol and I don’t intend to. I don’t want to go back to that life.”

The shadow attorney general, Shami Chakrabarti, has pledged to end the “authoritarian arms race” to lock up more criminals as prison officers deal with the aftermath of the latest in a string of prison riots.

In remarks that are being seen as signalling an end to New Labour’s “tough on crime” mantra, Chakrabarti said prison overcrowding had contributed to “a crisis this Christmas in British prisons”.

Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme after riot officers ended a disturbance at HMP Swaleside on the Isle of Sheppey, Chakrabarti said: “In my adult lifetime I have seen a doubling of the prison population and I think this was caused by an authoritarian arms race in British politics between the two parties. We are not in the arms race.

“After my background, I wouldn’t have joined this shadow cabinet if I didn’t think there was an opportunity to at least reflect on what has been going on for nearly a quarter of a century. I don’t believe the sum of human wickedness has doubled in my adult lifetime.”

Her comments follow the intervention by the former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg and the former home secretaries Ken Clarke and Jacqui Smith demanding a dramatic reduction in the prison population.

Chakrabarti, the former director of the human rights organisation Liberty, suggested that Labour was prepared to listen to prisoners who had been rioting in Britain’s jails. “There is a crisis this Christmas in British prisons. We have to call for calm, because I’m sure it is a very miserable time to be inside a prison, whether you are working there or incarcerated there. We know there is a crisis. We have to say to prisoners: ‘We are listening. We want this to be a better, safer environment.’

“We now have overcrowded, understaffed prisons. They are very unsafe places for prison officers and prisoners alike.”

She also called for a fundamental rethink of criminal justice policy that would include ending private sector involvement in running jails.

“We have an opportunity now for a different kind of conversation and to ask some really serious questions about what prison is for, and what do we want to achieve when we send someone to prison?” she said.

“I think we need to ask questions about whether it is right that there are companies that are profiting from incarceration. Private prisons are exempt from freedom of information, so we can’t deliver the same level of scrutiny to G4S that we can in relation to public sector prisons. I question whether there should be commercial incentives to lock up more and more people.”

A G4S spokesman said Chakrabarti was wrong to claim that private companies had a financial incentive to see an increased population behind bars.

“We are paid by the taxpayer per available prison place, not per prisoner, so it’s inaccurate to suggest we have an incentive to see more people locked up,” he said. “In fact we run some of the most progressive programmes in the country aimed at reforming and rehabilitating prisoners in the hope that they turn away from crime on release.

“Nor is it true to say that our prisons business is not subject to freedom of information. We provide government with information all the time to satisfy FoI requests regarding the facilities we manage.”

The Labour MP and former minister John Spellar accused Chakrabarti of unilaterally abandoning Labour’s policy of being “tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime”.

Her remarks came as the Prison Officers Association threatened a new wave of industrial action after rejecting a government pay offer. A ballot of members turned down the offer by 65.7% to 33.7%.

The POA’s general secretary, Steve Gillan, said he wanted to end the dispute through negotiation, but had not ruled out taking further industrial action.

“We have got a meeting on 10 January with the secretary of state [Liz Truss]. If she indicates to us that there is nothing else on the table, then our executive will determine a way forward and that will rule nothing in and nothing out,” he told the Guardian.

Asked whether the union was considering strike action, Gillan said: “I can’t spell out what that could mean, because we keep everything under wraps. I would rather a negotiated settlement than confrontation with the government.”



Gillan said the latest riot at Swaleside prison showed the kind of pressure that prison officers were under. “Our members at Swaleside and all over the country are picking up the pieces of failed government policy. Our members are brave and resilient, and it is about time they were rewarded by government … to ensure that prisons are safe and our members are safe,” he said.

Mike Rolfe, the national chair of the POA, said: “Prisons can work. What you have got to do is make sure you have got the staffing in place and you resource it properly. They need to be resourced properly. Unfortunately because it is a service that is behind walls and hidden, it is just somewhere they think they can cut quite easily and the general public aren’t going to notice.”

Other lives: Human rights activist who spent her later years championing animal welfare causes
###########################################################
Just as we’d resigned ourselves to the fact that the best 2016 was going to offer by the way of cheer was a new Star Wars film, and the prospect of a few mince pies and a tonne of mulled wine, Europe’s top court has given us a very welcome early Christmas present.

For anybody with an interest in protecting democracy, privacy, freedom of expression, a free press and the safety and cybersecurity of everybody in the UK, Wednesday’s EU court of justice judgment is cause for celebration.

In a landmark ruling – its first major post-referendum judgment involving the UK – the court ruled that our government is breaking the law by collecting all our internet and phone call records, then opening them up freely to hundreds of organisations and agencies.

This was a challenge brought by Labour deputy leader Tom Watson (and initially Brexit minister David Davis), and represented by Liberty, to the Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act (Dripa) – a temporary “emergency” law covering state surveillance, rushed on to the statute books in a matter of days in 2014.

It makes communications companies store records of all our emails, texts, phone calls and internet correspondence. This treasure trove of private information can then be accessed by a huge number of organisations and government agencies – from police forces to HMRC – and of course by hostile powers and terrorist hackers too.

If police wanted to root through your bedroom drawers, you’d expect them to have a warrant and a bloody good reason. But if they want to dip into this deeply sensitive personal data, they have a year’s supply of information sat waiting and can grant themselves permission. No need for sign-off from a judge. No need to suspect someone of a crime.

We argued that this breached British people’s rights – and on Wednesday the judges agreed. They said this national data hoard lets the state draw “very precise conclusions” about people’s private lives – including “everyday habits, permanent or temporary places of residence, daily or other movements, the activities carried out, the social relationships of those persons and the social environments frequented by them […] information that is no less sensitive, having regard to the right to privacy, than the actual content of communications”.

The judges also said it’s not right to gather data on innocent people – that instead it must only be harvested where there is suspicion of serious crime. And they said if someone is spied on, they have a right to know about it afterwards so that they can challenge it if it was wrong, and so we all know the true scale of the state’s surveillance regime.

These are simple, vital safeguards to introduce fairness, accountability and transparency into an otherwise shady world.

Dripa expires on 31 December. So why does any of this matter? Because a new law – the Investigatory Powers Act – has been passed to replace it. Think of it as the Death Star of surveillance laws – huge, impenetrable, and capable of doing massive damage.

It replicates all the same powers found unlawful yesterday – but it goes much further. It forces service providers to generate and store records of all our internet histories. Every site we visit, every app we open, every piece of software we download.

What do your internet searches give away, when you think about it, that might be dangerous in the wrong person’s hands? Your religion? Sexual interests? Health concerns? Political views?

As with Dripa, this can then be accessed by hundreds of public bodies – everyone from the Department for Work and Pensions to the Gambling Commission. No need for a judge to authorise access. No need for suspicion of crime.

After yesterday’s ruling, the unlawfulness of these new powers is beyond question too.

They’re also a major threat to our cybersecurity. These records are stored in vast databases which – at a time when companies and governments are under increasingly debilitating attacks from hackers – create goldmines for criminals and foreign spies. And it’s set to cost an estimated £170m.

But there’s more. Under the Investigatory Powers Act, the state has the ability to indiscriminately hack phones and computers, intercept our communications and build and acquire huge databases containing sensitive information on millions of people – which could include everything from your Oyster card logs to Facebook back-ups.

The government has announced it will try to fight the EU court’s ruling. Instead of wasting public money battling unwinnable cases, we urge it to swallow its pride, shoulder the responsibility of being democratic leaders and amend the act to create a targeted surveillance system – not one that sweeps up everyone’s private lives and swamps our spies with too much data.

The British state has used fear, spin and the guise of counter-terrorism to sneak through totalitarian-style surveillance laws. But our message to the government is clear: the jig is up. Since the Investigatory Powers Act passed, more than 200,000 people have signed a petition calling for its repeal – and if the government doesn’t act, Liberty will see them in court.

There’s reason to hope in 2017. This is a big victory, and it will be the first of many. And we all know what happened to the Death Star in the end.

My friend Joan Court, the animal and human rights activist, who has died aged 97, was driven by a powerful impulse to expose and remedy injustice and cruelty. She was also, as she put it, a “born sensualist”, her tastes running to strong colours, perfumes and “exciting action”. This, and her desire to do good, underpinned her many adventures.

Her start in life was hard: her father, Cecil Court, a solicitor, took his own life, and her mother, Muriel (nee Gibson), was an alcoholic. She had an older brother, Peter.

Joan’s schooling ended when she was 12, after her father’s death. She and her mother moved from their London home to work in domestic service in Cornwall and then Cape Town, South Africa. Returning to London in 1936, she went on to qualify as a nurse and midwife at St Thomas’ hospital, and as a social worker in Bristol. She practised as a midwife and, funded initially by the Friends Service Council (FSC) and later as a World Health Organisation employee, worked in impoverished regions of India and Turkey, and the Appalachian mountains of North America.

In the 1960s, she was appointed director of the NSPCC battered child research unit, and was influential in gaining acceptance of a then unfamiliar concept in the UK.

In 1946, when she was working for the FSC, organising midwifery services in the slums of Calcutta (Kolkata), she met and got to know Mahatma Gandhi. Joan, a lifelong vegetarian, developed a profound respect for his commitment, compassion and determination to achieve change through non-violent means. She tried to emulate these goals, campaigning first for children and, for the last 38 years, for animals.

In 1978, after seeing a poster describing the horrors of animal research, she took part in an Animal Aid anti-vivisection march in Cambridge. The next day she founded a new Cambridge group, which was soon involved in all animal-related issues, including live exports, hunting, shooting, whaling and the meat and dairy industries.

Her advanced age made her attention-grabbing stunts also irresistible to the media. Her animal campaigning began just before she was 60 – when she gained a social anthropology degree from Cambridge. There were banner-hangs, public hunger strikes and sit-downs in inconvenient places. She locked herself in a cage and chained herself to railings. In speeches and interviews she refused to apologise for radical direct action, although she was opposed to violence.

Her most lasting triumph was, with Pat Griffin and Sue Hughes, as one of three Cambridge “granarchists” who initiated what became a national campaign of opposition to Cambridge University’s plans for a massive new research facility that would have specialised in invasive neurological experiments on monkeys. The university abandoned the project in January 2004.

At the age of 85, she joined the Sea Shepherd flagship, Farley Mowat, on a hunt for illegal fishing vessels in the South Atlantic.

Joan could be self-absorbed, cantankerous, bossy and infuriating, but her friends were friends for life.

A teenage prisoner killed himself after he was transferred to a new institution, where staff failed to recognise his history of self-harm as a risk factor, an inquest jury has ruled.

Josh Collinson, 18, was found hanged at Swinfen Hall young offender institution in Staffordshire on 3 September last year.



He had been transferred the previous day from Parc prison, in south Wales, where he had self-harmed on six occasions and been placed on a list of at-risk prisoners.

The inquest jury at South Staffordshire coroner’s court found that Collinson should have been on the register – known as an Assessment Care, Custody, Teamwork (ACCT) register – after he had self-harmed six times at his previous prison.

Deborah Coles, the director of the charity Inquest, said Collinson’s death was preventable and an example of the catastrophic consequences of failures in assessment of vulnerable prisoners and sharing of vital information.

“The failures to protect vulnerable teenagers with mental health and learning disabilities were well documented in Lord Harris’s review of the deaths of young people in custody,” she said.

“The failure of government to implement the Harris review recommendations is resulting in the ongoing number of people dying alone and in despair in prisons. It is shameful.”

The inquest heard that Collinson, who was serving four years in prison for having sexual relations with a girl under 16, had been monitored closely at Parc after self-harming six times.

The jury were told that reception staff at Swinfen Hall failed to put Collinson on an at-risk register, despite the incidents at Parc.



The inquest heard that the staff on duty on the day Collinson arrived at Swinfen Hall were not aware of its policy of treating all new transfers as potentially being at risk of self-harm.

In their narrative verdict, the jury said Collinson should have been placed on an ACCT register immediately on his arrival at Swinfen Hall.

Collinson had lived in Ynyswen Treochy, about 40 miles from the prison, and had received regular visits from his family. He was moved due to population pressure and the jury ruled this was also a factor in his death.

The South Staffordshire coroner, Andrew Haigh, said he would write a “prevention of future deaths report” to the National Offender Management Service to recommend the implementation of a clear policy on transfer which ensured that a prisoner’s particular vulnerabilities were considered.

The inquest heard that, although Collinson was placed on an ACCT register after he self-harmed at Parc, he was not referred to a psychiatrist and received no therapy.

The jury were also told that Collinson’s mother was seriously ill while he was in Parc and died the following May. A member of the Collinson family said his mother was mindful she might not see the outcome of her son’s inquest and thought it important that the process continue in order to seek accountability and prevent future deaths.

The barrister Sam Jacobs represented the family at the inquest. He said that having a swollen prison population had real consequences and Collinson’s death was an example of that.

There were signs Collinson had begun to cope at Parc, Jacobs said, but due to population pressure he was moved many miles from his family.

“Transfers between prisons are known to be a difficult and high-risk time and he died on his his first night in Swinfen Hall. It is good news that the coroner is asking for the issue of prison transfers to be looked at nationally,” he said.

The Collinson family member said he was a loving, protective and thoughtful brother, son and uncle.

She said the family hoped the conclusion of the jury and the recommendations of the coroner would help to cultivate a culture of care and compassion in the prison system, especially among vulnerable, young people suffering mental health issues and learning difficulties.

A Prison Service spokesperson said: “This is an appalling case and our thoughts are with Josh Collinson’s family and friends. The safety and welfare of people within our custody is our top priority but we recognise that there were significant failings in the care of Mr Collinson.

“We have already taken action and accepted all the recommendations following the [Prison & Probation Ombudsman] investigation. We will now carefully consider lessons from the inquest findings to help ensure such incidents are not repeated.”

India’s rupee recall appears to have had “a massive impact” on the country’s human trafficking industry, according to advocacy and rescue groups, with some reporting reductions of up to 90% in the number of women and girls being admitted to their shelters.

But other activists said the illegal trade was already rebounding, and that the financial strain of demonetisation on poor communities was pushing new, younger girls into sex work, and forcing women already in the industry to work for credit or for free.

The Guardian contacted 10 human trafficking advocacy and rescue groups to assess the impact of the Indian government’s shock decision last month to scrap the country’s two most used bank notes.

The decision, which voided 86% of the currency in circulation in India and has left the country’s informal economy reeling, was justified partly on the basis that it would deprive criminal groups, including traffickers, of their cash stockpiles. But Indians too have been deprived of cash, limited to withdrawals of 2,500 rupees (£30) a day and stymied by long lines at ATMs and outside banks.

Demonetisation complicated every point in the human trafficking supply chain, starting with a “drastic reduction in the number of sex buyers”, said Sunita Krishnan, the co-founder of Prajwala, a Hyderabad-based NGO that rescues victims of sex slavery.

The dearth of customers for sex workers meant “it obviously did not make any sense to induct any new girls in this period”, Krishnan said. “In my shelter home, on average every month 60 to 70 new, rescued victims are admitted. From 8 November [the day demonetisation was announced] in the last 40 days, only six new victims have been admitted.

“I have been on this mission for more than two decades, and this is the first time I’ve seen the entire flesh trade so badly affected.”

There are 18 million people living in slavery in India, according to the 2016 Global Slavery Index, with about 135,000 children believed to be trafficked in the country every year.

Ashok Rajgor, the chief investigation officer at the Rescue Foundation, said no formal surveys had been conducted, “but our operatives in the field have noticed a sharp change”.

Fewer customers for brothels meant that traffickers had less capital to buy and transport women and girls from states such as Jharkhand, Assam and Bihar, all hubs for the trade.

“The market is totally down,” he said. “When you buy a girl, it’s a huge amount of money, maybe 200,000 rupees. It’s really big money and nowadays it’s very difficult to get that kind of cash.”

But he added: “The traffickers will look for other options. It’s too early to say how, but they’ll manage.”

The introduction of a new 2,000-rupee note, while supplies of small change remained scarce, had distorted the market, making younger girls more vulnerable, said Ruchira Gupta, the founder of Apne Aap, an NGO that works with women across Bihar and in Mumbai, Delhi and Kolkata.

“The demand for younger girls is going up,” Gupta said. “Now that [they] have only 2,000 rupee notes, clients don’t want older women, they want virgins and underage girls.”

She said the financial impact of demonetisation had left some women without enough money to buy food and their daughters at risk of being pushed into sex work.

Pimps, who in some red-light districts will take up to 70% of what a sex worker is paid, were beginning to force women to work for credit, she added.

“Women’s debt is increasing. Where we work in [the Delhi red light district] GB Road, I’m being told that brothel managers have started to keep log books, promising to pay the women later,” she said. “These women are being asked to work for free. They have to sleep with as many man as the pimps say just to have a bed and a meal.”

Other women were paid in old, invalid 500 rupee notes. “And the pimps are forcing them to take the money. [The women] have to stand at the bank for hours ever day [to exchange or deposit the notes]. Their income has been dramatically reduced,” she said.

Swati Maliwal, the head of the Delhi Commission for Women, which has been campaigning to have GB Road shut down and the women working there retrained, said her teams had observed similar phenomena. “The exploitation of women on GB Road has increased tremendously because men are coming and not paying them properly,” she said, adding that some women had started sleeping with up to 30 men each day to make ends meet.

Often, trafficked women lacked the identity papers required to set up a bank account to exchange void currency for new notes – meaning some had seen their cash savings wiped out, said Urmi Basu, head of the Kolkata-based New Light Foundation. “There are thousands of women who have no documentation, no bank accounts, apart from a few hundred rupees they tuck under their blouses,” she said.

A “very big slowdown” had been observed in the child labour trade, said Rakesh Singhal, from the NGO Bachpan Bachao Andolan.

He said his organisation – whose founder, Kailash Satyarthi, won the Nobel peace prize in 2014 for his work – had commissioned a study of the impact of demonetisation on the industry.

“But we have observations that show a very big slowdown,” Singhal said. “Most of the placement agencies for children say there is no domestic child labour supply.

“The whole trafficking industry runs on liquid money, you’re paying the whole supply chain, including agents in village areas, who are paying between 5,000 and 10,000 rupees for each child.”

All agreed the decline in the trade was likely to be temporary. “Trafficking is an organised crime, and traffickers and people involved in this crime adapt to newer means whenever there is a change in situations and the external environment,” said Prabhat Kumar, the general manager of Save the Children, India.

A court in Edinburgh has ruled that an environmental activist can sue Donald Trump’s golf resort near Aberdeen for breach of privacy and compensation after she was apparently filmed without her consent on the course.

A lawyer acting for Rohan Beyts, a long-time critic of resort’s impact on the environment and community, accused Trump’s staff of breaching the Data Protection Act by taking mobile-phone footage of her in April as she allegedly urinated behind a dune on the course.

The ruling raises the prospect of Trump facing a battle in the Scottish small claims court a few months into his first term as US president.



The Guardian revealed in August that Trump International Golf Course Scotland, which is wholly owned by Trump, had breached the UK’s strict laws on data protection and privacy after it failed to register with the Information Commissioner’s Office, despite operating an extensive CCTV system and handling data on thousands of golfers, guests, staff and suppliers. The resort insisted this was due to a clerical error.

Beyts’s lawyer, Mike Dailly, said the result was fantastic. “Although the defendant sought to have the case dismissed as incompetent, or transferred to the ordinary courts with unlimited expenses, or transferred to Aberdeen, all attempts to stop the case progressing were rejected by the sheriff,” he said. “So now there is a case to answer, and witnesses will have to give evidence on behalf of TIGC”.

Beyts, 62, told the Guardian she was delighted with the result and looked forward to making her case.

The case arose from an incident last April when Beyts and a friend used a public footpath across the Trump course to reach the sand dunes and beach that border the golf links. Returning from their walk, the pair say there were challenged by resort staff and then photographed by a local newspaper photographer.

Three days Beyts was visited at home by two Police Scotland officers who formally charged her with public annoyance. A third officer in charge of the complaint told her that two members of Trump’s staff and a guest on the course had filmed her on their mobile phones as she ducked out of sight.

Her prosecution raised fresh accusations from Trump’s critics that his staff were deliberately persecuting opponents and closely monitoring their movements on the resort.

The claim was heard before Sheriff Gordon Liddle on Thursday morning, who swiftly dispatched the arguments made by Paul Motion, the solicitor advocate acting for the resort.

Dailly argued that the case was a straightforward claim for invasion of privacy, on the basis that the resort had admitted it was not registered with the ICO, and that being filmed without her consent had caused distress to Beyts, for which she was seeking £3,000.

Motion questioned whether a small claims court was competent to deal with such a case.

Liddle concluded, however, that while he was aware that he was “dealing with ifs and buts, not black and white”, nothing had persuaded him that the case was incompetent as a small claim.

When Motion argued that the case should be held in Aberdeen, closer to the golf course and relevant witnesses, Liddle quipped: “Should I transfer it to Manhattan?” before noting that there was no reason why Beyts could not sue a company in the place where it had a registered office, in this case, Edinburgh.

Liddle was staunch in his defence of the principle of the small claims court when Motion argued that the case should be transferred to the ordinary courts. The sheriff said: “The effect of sending it to ordinary proceedings may well be [that Beyts] is discouraged from pursuing it because of the expense implications.” The limit on expenses was an “essential component” of the small claims system, he said.

TIGCS said: “Our position on Rohan Beyt’s claim remains unchanged and the matter is now in the hands of our lawyers.”

The next hearing is set to begin on 3 April and last for three days.

Sarah was cross-examined in a family court for more than two hours by a man who was the subject of a restraining order because of his violence towards her.

Michael had attacked her while she was pregnant with his child. He also had 18 convictions for violence, including two attacks on a previous girlfriend, one while their child was present, and had served at least two prison sentences.



Sarah had moved to a secret address to escape his stalking and was a high-risk victim of domestic violence, according to police officers, probation staff and other specialists.



Their relationship had always involved violence and threats. In 2010, when she was pregnant with their child, Michael attacked Sarah in a carpark. He was convicted of actual bodily harm and jailed for 17 weeks.



He was jailed again for 30 weeks when he punched another man linked to Sarah.

By 2013, Sarah had found the courage to leave. But the abuse did not stop. Michael stalked and harassed her for weeks, following her every movement and forcing Sarah to call the police 40 times. He was jailed again for breaching a non-molestation order. When he was released the criminal court imposed a restraining order against him, which prevented him from contacting Sarah or going near her.

But Michael initiated proceedings in the family court for contact with his child and in November 2014, during a fact-finding hearing, he was allowed to stand a few feet from her and question her.

She said: “When he was questioning me, it was like I was back in the house with him. I don’t think for one second the judge had any idea what I was going through. I don’t know how I had the strength to sit there with him asking me all these ridiculous questions and the judge didn’t intervene. But I did it for my children.

“The court’s attitude was that just because he has been violent in the relationship doesn’t mean he cannot have a relationship with the child.”

The court found the majority of facts presented about his abusive behaviour to be true. But after more than 25 hearings, Michael was granted supervised contact with his child, which would eventually move to unsupervised meetings in a church hall. “He has attacked me in public and many others,” Sarah said. “Yet they were suggesting a few ladies in a church hall would be enough protection for me and my child.”

When the child refused to see Michael, saying: “He hurts my mummy, I want to go home”, the court pursued contact for him.

An official from Cafcass, the children and family court advisory service, tried to persuade the child in several interviews, but eventually the official told the court that further persuasion was inappropriate and essentially abusive. The court upheld his recommendation with a final order of no contact for Michael.

Sarah said: “When I first went to court I was blind really. He had all of these convictions, he has been arrested, he has been to prison. I thought he has got no chance. How wrong I was.

“I got out of a really violent relationship but the court threw me back into harm’s way.”

Andrea has been going through the family courts for three years after her ex-partner applied for contact with his child. He has a criminal history of stalking and harassing her. Police say he poses a high risk to her and her family.

Andrea ended the relationship while she was pregnant because of his obsessive behaviour and harassment. He then began stalking.

“When my baby was two-months-old, he came to my new home late at night, he told me he had moved to be near me,” she said. “I agreed to meet him with my baby, but when I did he was only interested in resuming our relationship, which I did not want. He frightened me and tried to manipulate me so I stopped responding to him.”

Andrea reported his behaviour to police and he was given a caution. In May 2012, he was arrested and pleaded guilty to harassment, getting 12 months’ probation. Andrea was granted an indefinite restraining order.

When the child was 18-months-old the father applied to the family court for contact. “The family court ignored the restraining order the criminal court had put in place and continued with his application,” said Andrea. “They forced me to attend court without putting any safeguarding in place.”

Within two days, her ex-partner had set up a fake social media profile and used it to harass Andrea. He was convicted of breaching the restraining order and fined £100. But in the family court he pursued contact with his child.

Separate Cafcass reports strongly recommended no contact between the man and the child because of the high risk he posed to Andrea.

But in 2015, lay magistrates said he should have indirect contact with his child. They were satisfied the man was engaging with mental health services as required.

Andrea was promised she would be able to give evidence via video link but was later told she had to attend.

“I just couldn’t do it, it was just feeding his obsession. I was terrified,” she said. As a result, her written evidence was disregarded. The case is now with a more senior judge.

In late 2016, a senior Cafcass official urged the court to make a final order of no contact, saying any contact may feed the man’s obsession and place mother and child at risk. He wrote: “It is time the matter was ended … the facts do not argue for contact.”

Another Cafcass official agreed, saying a well-documented history of harassment and stalking meant there should be a final order of no contact.

But the judge is continuing the man’s application for contact.

“It feels like they are targeting me and my family,” said Andrea. “I am constantly terrified the court is going to put me and my family in even more danger.”



Clare is a victim of extreme domestic violence, who is considered at risk of severe harm or murder at the hands of her ex-partner.

In 2014, while she was tending her baby, he attacked her at home. He was later refused contact with the child but is now challenging that through the family courts.

For the last year Clare, who received legal aid as a victim of domestic violence, has submitted documents, text messages and witness reports to provide evidence of his violence, repeated threats to kill her and her children and his controlling behaviour.

In a two-day fact-finding hearing, the judge upheld almost all of the facts alleged by Clare against her ex-partner, including threats to set fire to her and the children and a threat to rape her. The judge said the threats to kill Clare and her children were “hideous”.

He acknowledged the behaviour was that of an overly jealous man who wanted to control her, saying one incident was the most “upsetting and distressingly abusive” thing he had ever heard.

However, the judge is ordering the agencies involved to find a way of allowing the father contact with his young child. Clare said: “For me as a mother it shocks me that a judge can see all these violent threats, and see from his criminal record that this is a man who does what he threatens to do, and can be considering allowing him contact with his child. That leaves me speechless.”

Violent and abusive men are being allowed to confront and cross-examine their former partners in secretive court hearings that fail to protect women who are victims of abuse, a Guardian investigation has found.

Mothers involved in family court hearings have given graphic descriptions of the “torture” of being questioned by abusive men – a practice still allowed in civil cases but banned in criminal courts.

They describe how former partners can make repeated, sometimes spurious, court applications to continue the harassment.

In one case, a mother was cross-examined for two hours by her ex-husband despite him being the subject of a restraining order to keep him away from her.

Sarah, whose name has been changed, said: “I thought, why does the judge allow him to continue this abuse? I had escaped a really violent relationship, it was a very hard thing to do, and the court threw me back into harm’s way constantly. It was torture for me.”

Family courts cases are held in private in England and Wales. The testimony of witnesses, documentary evidence, expert statements and judicial decisions are mostly still secret.

Women who spoke to the Guardian knew they were at risk of being held in contempt of court but said they wanted to shine a light on the secretive processes.

The revelations have prompted one MP to demand a review of the way the court system operates and a change in the law. Peter Kyle, Labour MP for Hove and Portslade, said the situation amounted to the “abuse and brutalisation” of women by the legal system. “Mothers need the protection of the law and they need to know in advance that the system is there to look out and protect their interests,” he said.

“It only takes one woman to be placed in a situation where she can be legally be asked by the man who has violently abused her; ‘When did you last have sex?’. That only has to happen once to realise that the system is corrupted and domestic abuse is going on in our system in the courtroom.”

The evidence obtained by the Guardian spans ongoing and completed cases, interviews with participants, lawyers and court officials. It reveals how the family court:

Research by the all-party parliamentary group on domestic violence found that 55% of women had no access to special measures in the family courts, where 70% of separation and child contact cases involve some form of domestic violence.

One mother whose case was examined by the Guardian was told by a judge to sit next to her ex-partner to view a police video of her reporting his sexual assault. She said: “Since when is it OK to force a victim of abuse to sit next to her abuser around a laptop and watch the police video of the statements she made to the police about her sexual abuse? There was no screen in place, they provided no separate room for me.”

Polly Neate, chief executive of Women’s Aid, has presented research to the judiciary that shows a quarter of victims of domestic violence surveyed had been cross-examined by abusive partners. “When we talk to judges about this they say that this never happens. But it is happening, that is clear, and it seems fairly difficult to get this across,” she said.

Neate is in talks with a senior judge selected by the president of the family division, Sir James Munby, to force the courts to follow guidance, known as practice direction 12J, which is designed to protect mothers from direct cross-examination by violent perpetrators of abuse.

Responding to the revelations in the Guardian, Cris McCurley, a family lawyer from the north-east, said: “I have worked on hundreds of cases and the direct cross examination of victims by a perpetrator happens a lot. It is absolutely traumatising. We have got to get something in place to stop this, even if it means appointing a special advocate or even a law student to put the questions instead of the perpetrator.”

McCurley said the cuts to legal aid and the cutbacks in the whole court estate, meant the situation for vulnerable women within the family courts was getting worse. Women who have suffered domestic violence are entitled to legal aid if they can prove with documentation that they are a victim. Many women do not qualify and are forced to represent themselves before their alleged perpetrator.

Jane Monckton-Smith, an expert in domestic homicides, stalking and coercive control, said the family court system was antiquated. “The family courts need to up their game in order to prevent abusive men using the access they are being given by the courts to continue their behaviour,” she said.



Monckton-Smith said the case of Ben Butler, the father who killed his six-year-old daughter Ellie after a family court judge returned the child to him and his partner, should have been a warning sign about how some abusive men can manipulate the system and put women and children at risk. But that had not happened.

Legal aid cuts mean increasing numbers of men and women are representing themselves in court, increasing the chance of some men being able to use the process as part of their continuing harassment, abuse and controlling behaviour. Ministry of Justice figures released in October 2016 show in 80% of family law cases at least one of the parties was a litigant in person.



Zoe Dronfield set up a support group, I want my Mummy (IWMM), after her abusive ex-partner was given emergency custody of their child.

“I speak out because most women cannot,” she said. “The family court stipulates that they must not talk about their case, so the secrecy goes on and they are kept silent.”

Cases examined by the Guardian reveal that judges in some cases appear to be ignoring advice from agencies including police, social services and Cafcass officials, to allow an abusive man contact with a child.

Mandip Ghai, legal officer for Rights of Women, said: “Judges will bend over backwards to try and find a way for contact to take place. We have cases where there has been quite serious domestic violence and Cafcass has recommended no direct contact, but the judge finds a way of deciding to allow it anyway.”

Many courts, she said, were failing to carry out fact-finding hearings where there were allegations of domestic abuse and that could put a child at risk.

“If there is no fact-finding hearing to establish whether there has been domestic violence, then there is no assessment of the risk the child might be in. There needs to be some thought about how this situation can be improved,” she said.

A judiciary spokesman said the president of the family division has acknowledged in public a pressing need to address the issue of abusive men questioning their victims, and the wider issue of protecting vulnerable victims of domestic violence.

In another case, a district judge is allowing a father with a history of violence, who has made repeated threats to kill his ex and his child, to continue his case for contact with the child. His former partner said: “It shocks me that a judge can see all these violent threats, and see from his criminal record that this is a man who does what he threatens to do, and … consider allowing him contact with his child. That leaves me speechless.” 



Claire Waxman, of Voice4Victims who are campaigning to end the abuse of process in civil courts, said the family courts were undermining the criminal justice process. “Women feel bullied by the court and they are terrified of their restraining orders being altered because they know it will put them at risk, so they agree to everything the family court says. It is shocking.”

The Prince of Wales has warned that the rise of populist extremism and intolerance towards other faiths risks repeating the “horrors” of the Holocaust.

Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s religious Thought for the Day slot, the prince delivered an outspoken attack against religious hatred and pleaded for a welcoming attitude to those fleeing persecution. 



He said: “We are now seeing the rise of many populist groups across the world that are increasingly aggressive to those who adhere to a minority faith. All of this has deeply disturbing echoes of the dark days of the 1930s.

“My parents’ generation fought and died in a battle against intolerance, monstrous extremism and inhuman attempts to exterminate the Jewish population of Europe.”

The prince did not mention any politicians by name, but his address will be seen by some as a veiled reference to the election of Donald Trump in the US, the rise of the far right in Europe, and increasingly hostile attitudes to refugees in the UK.

“That nearly 70 years later we should still be seeing such evil persecution is to me beyond all belief,” he said. “We owe it to those who suffered and died so horribly not to repeat the horrors of the past.”

Prince Charles said religious hatred was on the increase, leading to a rise in refugees fleeing persecution.

“According to the United Nations, 5.8 million more people abandoned their homes in 2015 than the year before, bringing the annual total to a staggering 65.3 million. That is almost equivalent to the entire population of the United Kingdom,” he said.

“The suffering doesn’t end when they arrive seeking refuge in a foreign land.”

The prince urged listeners this Christmas to remember “how the story of the Nativity unfolds with the fleeing of the holy family to escape violent persecution”.

He added: “We might also remember that when the prophet Muhammad migrated from Mecca to Medina, he did so because he too was seeking the freedom for himself and his followers to worship.”

The prince recalled meeting a Jesuit priest from Syria. “He told me of mass kidnappings in parts of Syria and Iraq, and how he feared that Christians would be driven en masse out of lands described in the Bible,” he said. “He thought it quite possible there would be no Christians in Iraq within five years.”

He continued: “The scale of religious persecution around the world is not widely appreciated. Nor is it limited to Christians in the troubled regions of the Middle East.” He then cited a recent report that found an increase in attacks on minority faiths.

The Labour MEP Claude Moraes, chair of the European parliament’s civil liberties, justice and home affairs committee, welcomed the prince’s intervention.

He said it was “obvious” which politicians the prince was referring to, “but for protocol reasons he can’t say”. Moraes told the Guardian: “It was a good intervention I think when the right and rightwing UK newspapers dominate the anti-refugee, intolerance, and anti-EU protectionist narrative.” 



The prince was invited to speak as part of BBC Radio 4’s religious programming. It was the third time the heir to the throne had given the address. He first broadcast in the Thought for the Day slot on the anniversary of VE Day in 1995, and did so again in January 2000 to mark the new millennium.

He pre-recorded his message on Monday at his official London home, Clarence House, before it was announced that the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh had delayed plans to travel to Norfolk for Christmas, because of illness. The prince did not mention the health of his parents.

A trio of senior figures from the three main UK parties has called for a radical rethink of prison policy in England which would lead to the jail population being almost halved.

Kenneth Clarke, the Conservative former home secretary and justice secretary, Jacqui Smith, the Labour former home secretary, and Nick Clegg, the Lib Dem former deputy prime minister, have warned that the prison crisis will do “untold damage to wider society” if it is not addressed.

The prison population should be cut from its current level, around 85,000, to what it was in the 1980s, around 45,000, they say in a letter to the Times.

“To restore order, security, and purpose to our jails, ministers should now make it their policy to reduce prison numbers. We want to see the prison population returned to the levels it was under Margaret Thatcher, herself no ‘soft touch’,” their letter says.

Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Thursday, Clegg claimed that the problem originated with an approach that Michael Howard, as Conservative home secretary, set out in a speech to his party conference in 1993 saying “prison works”.

Clegg claimed that the “‘prison works’ dogma” had subsequently been adopted by governments of all political persuasions, leading to a “very dramatic increase” in the prison population.

This had created an “overcrowded, large, dangerous and crucially ineffective prison system”, he said.

“I think what people are increasingly appreciating is the test of an effective criminal justice system is what keeps the public most safe. And actually locking up, warehousing, increasingly large numbers of people in very, very dangerous conditions, only to see them go out and commit crime again, is not the way to keep society safe.”

Clegg accepted that one cause of the current problem in prisons was the reduction in staffing levels that took place under the coalition, from around 25,000 in 2010 to 18,000 now.

But he claimed that this policy was initiated at a time when Clarke was pursuing policies as justice secretary intended to reduce the number of people being sent to jail. Clarke was subsequently replaced as justice secretary by the more authoritarian Chris Grayling, who did not share Clarke’s views.

Clegg said the size of the prison population was not simply indicative of the crime rate. Sentencing policy was a crucial factor, he said, and he cited factors such as the increase in the number of people subject to indeterminate sentences, the “explosion” in the amount of extra days being added to sentences for crimes committed in jail and the increasing use of recall for prisoners who breach their conditions when released on licence as reasons for the rise in the number of people being detained.

“So there is a lot you can do while keeping society, not only safe, but safer, by bearing down on repeat crime, making sure that prisoners are both punished and rehabilitated, but also changing the myriad of rules that apply to sentencing such that you do not have this overstretched and overburdened prison population,” Clegg said.

In a separate development, it has emerged that G4S, which runs Birmingham jail, has decided to replace locks in the prison after a picture of a set of keys to them was posted on social media during last week’s riot. Replacing the locks will cost around £750,000.

Belfast gay-themed cake case will not go to UK supreme court
###########################################################
Northern Ireland’s attorney general cannot refer back to the supreme court the case of a local bakery fined for refusing to bake a gay-themed cake.



John Larkin QC’s legal bid to get the supreme court to review court rulings against Ashers Bakery was deemed to have come in too late, Northern Ireland’s lord chief justice said on Wednesday.



In October the court of appeal in Belfast upheld a conviction that found Ashers guilty of discrimination for refusing to bake a pro-same sex marriage themed cake.



The family-owned firm in the original case was also ordered to pay £500 compensation to the local gay rights activist Gareth Lee, whose legal action was backed by the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland.



Lee had tried to buy a cake depicting the Sesame Street characters Bert and Ernie below the motto “Support gay marriage” for an event to mark International Day Against Homophobia in 2014.



In his ruling on Wednesday the lord chief justice, Declan Morgan, said that the attorney general’s move came after the case against the McArthur family-owned firm had ended. 



“We do not consider there are exceptional circumstances in this case which require us to re-open proceedings,” Sir Declan said in his judgement.



The rejection of Larkin’s request for a supreme court hearing came about after lawyers for the McArthur family were also refused a plea to appeal the verdict in the same court seven days ago.



The Ashers case has received international attention, and highlighted the tensions between gay rights reformers and the politically influential and socially conservative born-again Christian lobby within Northern Ireland.



Gareth Lee placed his order at Ashers Bakery shortly after the Democratic Unionist party used its power of veto in the Northern Ireland assembly to block moves to make gay marriage legal in the province. The region is the only part of the UK where same-sex marriage is still not recognised in law. 



Lee claimed the baker’s refusal to bake his cake made him feel “like a lesser person” and so he made a formal complaint with the Equality Commission in Northern Ireland who acted on his behalf though the courts.



The DUP has a strong base in the province’s evangelical Christian community and was founded out of the late Dr Ian Paisley’s Free Presbyterian church. The party has consistently blocked proposals in the assembly from other parties including their main partners in government, Sinn Féin, to legalise gay marriage.

A family court judge has criticised “serious and systemic flaws” in how West Yorkshire police and Wakefield council handled a case in which a girl and her mother were wrongly identified as appearing in a child sexual abuse video.



The police and council have paid £20,000 in damages and Wakefield council apologised for the “horrendous” allegation, after the girl and her brother were kept in care for more than nine months.

It emerged that the police had known for months that the video did not show the girl and her mother before the children were returned.

Judgments in the family court are usually private, but Mr Justice Cobb decided to make his ruling, issued this week, public on the condition that the family involved was not identified.

The two children, a boy and a girl, were removed and placed in foster care in February 2015 after their parents were arrested in relation to an investigation into child sexual abuse content.

During the search, police found a video that they believed showed the mother engaged in a sex act with the daughter and a photograph they believed showed the daughter. 



The children were kept out of any contact with their parents for several days after being taken into care, despite expressing “very considerable distress”, the judge wrote, and a lack of coordination between the police and safeguarding authority meant that the girl was medically examined twice in three days.

Forensic experts told the officer leading the investigation, DS Hudson, in late March that video analysis had “eliminated” the mother as a possible candidate for being the woman in the video. In June, evidence emerged showing the video had been shot in the US, rather than West Yorkshire and that it conclusively did not show either the woman or her daughter.

But West Yorkshire police did not share this crucial evidence with social workers or anyone else involved in the case for almost five months. Even the police lawyers were only told of the new evidence in passing in August and were only made aware of how crucial it was in November.

In the meantime, the police continued to investigate, interviewing the parents under caution and showing them the photo of the girl in the video despite knowing it was not their daughter.

DS Hudson “struggled to shake off” his conviction that the video showed the mother and daughter, the court found. At a meeting in August, the judge found, he “misled the local authority” by encouraging them to spot similarities between the woman in the video and the mother. “At that time, he knew that the mother had been definitively excluded from consideration,” Cobb wrote.

The children’s father pleaded guilty to having downloaded images of child sexual abuse in August and was later sentenced to jail. The mother did not learn that she had been cleared until November and her children remained in foster care until mid-December. The authority later accepted “without reservation” that she neither abused her daughter nor allowed her daughter to be abused by the father.

“The damage has been significant; for a period of many months, two children were separated from their mother against whom allegations of the most serious form of abuse were levelled, while all the while, evidence was available which served to exonerate her,” Cobb wrote.

Wakefield council and West Yorkshire police acknowledged a series of failings in their handling of the case. The judge found that although it had been correct to take the children into care when their parents were first arrested, the way the investigation was handled led to the authorities “profoundly and obviously” breaching the human rights of the mother and her children. Among the failings, he said, was “a casual regard, and in some respects total disregard, of ordinary principles of good professional practice”.

Human Rights Watch has condemned the Home Office for its “non-transparent and arbitrary” process for transferring unaccompanied child refugees to the UK.

In a scathing attack, the campaign group said the process was so ill-considered that the government had ended up separating siblings, in breach of the Dubs amendment to immigration laws, which pledged to give some unaccompanied children refuge in Britain.

In the case of two boys from Ethiopia, a 12-year-old was transferred to the UK while his 15-year-old brother was left behind.

In another case, Human Rights Watch said a boy and his half-sister were separated when the girl was reunited with an uncle, but the boy was not because he was not directly related to the adult.

The group based its criticism on interviews with 41 unaccompanied child refugees from Ethiopia, Eritrea, Sudan, Syria and Afghanistan in reception centres in France.

The interviews took place between 5 and 16 December, the period directly before and after the Home Office announced on 9 December that it had stopped transfers from France.

Human Rights Watch said children were being left in the dark on the process, leading to psychological distress and, in two cases, suicidal thoughts.

It said: “Children said they did not have information about how and when they would learn the outcome in their cases, the selection criteria, what recourse, if any, they have if they are not accepted, and how they could follow up with the UK Home Office.

“Several said they were so upset that they could not sleep or eat, and two said they thought of taking their own lives. A 17-year-old boy who had been detained in his home country, Ethiopia, and in Libya en route to France, said that he was desperate to join his aunt in the UK,” it said. The charity said the boy told them: “‘I am very lonely here … I am going to kill myself [if I cannot go].’”

The group concluded that the transfer process for children lacked transparency and was arbitrary, hurting children’s mental health.

The findings echo those of other charities, including Help Refugees, Safe Passage and Social Workers without Borders, who have said both the French and British governments were breaching children’s rights by not having a care plan for each child, as they would for a homeless British or French child.

Minors being monitored by Social Workers without Borders in a reception centre in Taizé, near the Swiss border, have been refusing to eat because of the lack of information from the Home Office.

Other volunteers working in Bruniquel, in the south of France, said two children who had refused to eat had been taken to hospital. They have since been returned to the reception centre.

in the south-western French town of Biscarrosse, a group of Sudanese children demonstrated this week to show their anger at having their applications rejected without explanation.

About 2,000 children were dispersed across France from the Calais camp at the end of October, all of whom expected that they would be eligible for transfer to the UK under the Dubs amendment or the Dublin regulation.

The Dublin law allows unaccompanied minors who have family in another EU country to have their asylum considered in that country.

The Dubs amendment to the Immigration Act allows the government to consider unaccompanied children who have no family for asylum in the UK.

Human Rights Watch said it had found minors who appeared to qualify under the regulation – including a 16-year-old boy who has an uncle, aunt, and grandparents in the UK – still in France.

It said the Home Office transfer criteria to implement the Dubs amendment were too strict and did not comply with its spirit.

Last month, the Home Office was criticised after it announced new Dubs criteria that would stop many Eritrean, Afghan and Yemeni teenagers aged 13 or 14 from getting sanctuary in the UK.

The new guidelines, issued to charities two weeks after the Calais camp was cleared, in effect barred those teenagers regardless of why they had left their home countries.

The guidance said it would take under-13s of all nationalities, those deemed at high risk of sexual exploitation, and those who “are aged 15 or under and are of Sudanese or Syrian nationality” because people from those countries are already granted asylum in the UK in 75% of cases.

Human Rights Watch said the Dubs criteria did not appear to have been correctly followed in all cases, including the separation of older siblings from younger ones who do qualify.

It called for the Home Office to broaden its selection criteria and reminded it that the Dubs amendment was “intended as a humanitarian measure”.

It also criticised the French government for abandoning normal safeguarding rules for children in the reception centres.

It said that the children were being looked after “outside the regular child protection service” and that the children in the reception centres “have not had access to asylum procedures or the regular child protection system in France”. The Home Office has been contacted for comment.

The number of children and men who fall prey to traffickers is rising, a UN study has found, with the global movement of refugees and migrants a major contributory factor.

Although women and girls account for more than 70% of human trafficking victims, the largest increase in the number of refugees and migrants since the aftermath of the second world war has left children and men more vulnerable to exploitation, according to the report.

Yury Fedotov, head of the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the UN body charged with tackling the problem, warned that the average number of convictions for the crime remains low.

“As this crisis has unfolded, and climbed up the global agenda, there has been a corresponding recognition that, within these massive migratory movements, are vulnerable children, women and men who can be easily exploited by smugglers and traffickers,” wrote Fedotov in a foreword to the study.

Children account for almost a third of all human trafficking victims worldwide, according to the UNODC’s global report on trafficking in persons (pdf), with the number rising to about two-thirds in regions such as sub-Saharan Africa, and Central America and the Caribbean.

While women and girls tend to be trafficked for marriage or sexual slavery, the report found that men and boys are typically exploited for forced labour in the mining sector and also as porters, soldiers and slaves.

The number of men detected among trafficking victims globally rose from 13% in 2004 to 21% in 2014. The number of trafficking victims pressed into forced labour also rose, accounting for 38% of all trafficked people identified in 2014 (as opposed to 32% in 2007). Of that 38%, almost two-thirds were male.

The flow of trafficking victims from sub-Saharan Africa and east Asia was more globally dispersed than elsewhere, for instance in eastern Europe and Central Asia, South America and south Asia. However, most trafficking flows are largely a regional and local phenomenon rather than a global one.

When it comes to trafficking into key destinations such as richer European countries, flows from the continent’s south-eastern regions were the most prominent for a number of years and continued to increase.



Fedotov said there had been a “huge improvement” in the number of countries criminalising human trafficking, which has increased from 18% to 88% since 2003. But conviction rates remain far too low, he said, with victims not always receiving the protection and services countries are obliged to provide.



Fedotov added that people escaping from war and persecution are particularly vulnerable to trafficking: “The rapid increase in the number of Syrian victims of trafficking in persons following the start of the conflict there, for instance, seems to be one example of how these vulnerabilities play out.”

A lawyer for 249 men seeking compensation for alleged sexual abuse at a Catholic children’s home has vowed to continue with one of the largest compensation claims against the church despite a judge dismissing three of the first test cases.

The high court in Leeds awarded one of the claimants £14,000 in compensation and ruled against three other men. Judgment in a fifth case will be given next month.



The men’s lawyer, David Greenwood of Switalskis, said outside court: “This is a skirmish; we will win the ultimate war.”



The claims were made against the diocese of Middlesbrough and the De La Salle Institute, which ran the St William’s children’s home in Market Weighton, east Yorkshire.



The civil case followed the imprisonment earlier this year of the home’s former principal and chaplain for sexual offences against 11 boys between 1970 and 1991.



James Carragher, the former principal, was jailed for 15 years for 21 indecent assaults and three serious sex offences, but cleared of a further 30 charges. It was the third time he had been sent to prison for sexually abusing boys at the home.



Anthony MacCallen, the former chaplain, was convicted of 11 charges, including a serious sexual offence. He was acquitted of eight others.



The residential school, which closed in 1992, was owned by the diocese of Middlesbrough and run by members of the De La Salle brotherhood. It took boys from troubled backgrounds referred by local authorities.



A civil action was launched in 2004 but delayed by a dispute between the diocese and brotherhood over which was liable for compensation of potentially £8m. In 2012, the supreme court ruled that both were liable.



On Wednesday, Judge Mark Gosnell awarded one of the claimants £14,000 “for injury to feelings and the additional upset caused by the fact that it was perpetrated by someone who should have been looking after him”.



He dismissed three other claims, saying the claimants had failed to “discharge the burden of proof of [them] satisfying me that the abuse occurred on the balance of probability”.



Greenwood, who has been pursuing the claims since 2003, said he would appeal against the judge’s dismissal of three of the claims.



“I would say, obviously, on the central issue of whether it happened or not, there was compelling evidence given by all four, all five, of these claimants, and that should be the main issue that we are talking about,” he said.



He was “disappointed that the judge did not see through all these arguments about minor inconsistencies but this is a skirmish; we will win the ultimate war. There are 245 cases still to go, so I’m very confident we will succeed.

“There was a lot of sexual abuse going on at St William’s and these boys deserve justice.”



Both the diocese of Middlesbrough and the De La Salle brotherhood have previously issued statements condemning abuse.



“We deeply regret what happened at St William’s and the harm that was done there through the behaviour of James Carragher. We unreservedly apologise to all who have been affected by his behaviour. Our hearts go out to all victims of abuse and their families,” the brotherhood said earlier this year.



The diocese said: “Abusive behaviour has absolutely no place in the Catholic church, or anywhere in society, and is against everything we stand for.”



Another set of compensation claims is expected before the high court in late 2017.

“General and indiscriminate retention” of emails and electronic communications by governments is illegal, the EU’s highest court has ruled, in a judgment that could trigger challenges against the UK’s new Investigatory Powers Act – the so-called snooper’s charter.

Only targeted interception of traffic and location data in order to combat serious crime – including terrorism – is justified, according to a long-awaited decision by the European court of justice (ECJ) in Luxembourg.

The finding came in response to a legal challenge initially brought by the Brexit secretary, David Davis, when he was a backbench MP, and Tom Watson, Labour’s deputy leader, over the legality of GCHQ’s bulk interception of call records and online messages.

Davis and Watson, who were supported by Liberty, the Law Society, the Open Rights Group and Privacy International, had already won a high court victory on the issue, but the government appealed and the case was referred by appeal judges to the ECJ. The case will now return to the court of appeal to be resolved in terms of UK legislation.



The aim of going to Luxembourg was to clarify EU law on surveillance. The two MPs had argued successfully in the domestic courts that the Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act (Dripa) 2014 was illegal. Dripa has since been replaced by the Investigatory Powers Act, which comes into force at the end of this month.

At issue was whether there are EU standards on data retention that need to be respected by member states in domestic legislation. The result, though immediately significant, could prove academic once the UK has withdrawn from the EU and the ECJ no longer has jurisdiction over the UK.

In a summary of the ruling, the court said electronic communications allow “very precise conclusions to be drawn concerning the private lives of persons whose data has been retained”.

It added: “The interference by national legislation that provides for the retention of traffic data and location data with that right must therefore be considered to be particularly serious. 



“The fact that the data is retained without the users of electronic communications services being informed of the fact is likely to cause the persons concerned to feel that their private lives are the subject of constant surveillance. Consequently, only the objective of fighting serious crime is capable of justifying such interference.

“Legislation prescribing a general and indiscriminate retention of data … exceeds the limits of what is strictly necessary and cannot be considered to be justified within a democratic society.” Prior authorisation by a court or independent body to access retained data is required for each official request, the ECJ said. 



Before becoming Brexit minister, Davis travelled to Luxembourg to hear the case. He argued that the British government was “treating the entire nation as suspects” by ignoring safeguards on retaining and accessing personal communications data.

Davis, one of the most vociferous critics of the state’s powers to collect data on its citizens, withdrew from the case following his ministerial appointment.

The Dripa case was heard by 15 ECJ judges. It coincided with successive atrocities in Paris, Brussels and Nice that reinforced political demands for expansion of powers to intercept emails and phone calls to help catch Islamic State militants operating on the continent.

Lawyers for the UK government maintained that intercepted communications have been at the heart of every terrorist case investigated by police and the security services in recent years.

Responding to the ruling, Watson said: “At a time when we face a real and ever-present terrorist threat, the security forces may require access to personal information none of us would normally hand over. That’s why it’s absolutely vital that proper safeguards are put in place to ensure this power is not abused, as it has been in the recent past.

“Most of us can accept that our privacy may occasionally be compromised in the interests of keeping us safe, but no one would consent to giving the police or the government the power to arbitrarily seize our phone records or emails to use as they see fit. It’s for judges, not ministers, to oversee these powers.”

Martha Spurrier, director of the human rights group Liberty, said: “Today’s judgment upholds the rights of ordinary British people not to have their personal lives spied on without good reason or an independent warrant. The government must now make urgent changes to the Investigatory Powers Act [IPA] to comply with this.

“This is the first serious post-referendum test for our government’s commitment to protecting human rights and the rule of law. The UK may have voted to leave the EU – but we didn’t vote to abandon our rights and freedoms.” Liberty is preparing to challenge the IPA in court. 



Jim Killock, executive director of the Open Rights Group, said: “Blanket surveillance of our communications is intrusive and unacceptable in a democracy. 



“The government must act quickly to rewrite the IPA or be prepared to go to court again.”



A Home Office spokesperson said: “We are disappointed with the judgment from the European court of justice and will be considering its potential implications.

“The government will be putting forward robust arguments to the court of appeal about the strength of our existing regime for communications data retention and access.”

The shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, said: “Many of us warned that these powers were far too widely drawn. Effectively, they allow for fishing expeditions where data is collected on a vast number of individuals. They also allow for data gathering against anyone suspected of the most minor crimes, not just terrorism and organised crime, and there is insufficient judicial oversight. Targets were not informed.”

The Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Brian Paddick said: “Collecting and storing everyone’s internet web browsing histories and phone records so government agencies can look at them is an Orwellian nightmare that intrudes into our privacy and erodes our civil liberties.”

Daniel Carey, the solicitor from Deighton Pierce Glynn who represented the Open Rights Group and Privacy International, said: “The court is very clear that indiscriminately retaining everyone’s metadata is unlawful, which is a point my clients placed particular emphasis on. This prohibition arises out of longstanding EU legislation, which the UK played an important role in creating.”

Camilla Graham Wood, of Privacy International, said: “Today’s judgment is a major blow against mass surveillance and an important day for privacy. It makes clear that blanket and indiscriminate retention of our digital histories can be a very intrusive form of surveillance that needs strict safeguards against abuse and mission creep.”

The National Police Chiefs’ Council lead for communications data, assistant chief constable Richard Berry said: “We will work within any authorisation and oversight regime deemed appropriate by parliament and courts of law. But it is important for us to have a regime that is practical and dynamic enough to be able to respond to the volume and urgency of our cases. Any changes that impede our ability to access data quickly with appropriate safeguards will undermine our ability to keep people safe.”

The European court of justice (ECJ) ruling that blanket state surveillance without proper privacy safeguards is unlawful is packed with post-Brexit irony – not least in that it involves Britain losing a case in Europe initially brought by its Brexit minister, David Davis. But it is important because it means the battle over digital rights in Britain is not yet over.

Theresa May’s new turbo-charged state surveillance law – the Investigatory Powers Act 2016, with its extensive powers to track the entire population’s web browsing history for two years and allowing industrial scale state hacking of phones and computers – will come into effect from the end of this month.

But the ruling from the ECJ – particularly if, as is likely, it is upheld by British court of appeal judges – will mean that the new law will now face a succession of legal challenges from privacy campaigners fortified by the ruling in their back pockets.

The ruling itself relates to a much more limited British law – the Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act 2014, known as Dripa – which expires under a sunset clause at the end of this month. That law required the telecom companies to hold all their customers’ communications data – the who, when and where they contacted by phone, text or email – for 12 months so it could be accessed by the police, security services and other public bodies.

The ECJ ruling clarified, at the request of British court of appeal judges, that EU data retention laws say such blanket retention of personal confidential data is unlawful under the EU’s fundamental charter of rights and its directive on privacy and electronic communications.

The landmark ruling says the state can carry out mass surveillance programmes only if they are targeted and not implemented on a “general and indiscriminate” basis. Targeting should be done by reference to time, geographical area or named persons. The ruling also lays down that the communications data can only be used for the purposes of fighting serious crime and access should be authorised by a court except in the most urgent cases.

The ruling is enough to strike down Dripa, should the UK court of appeal accept this “clarification” from the EU’s highest judges, but it will be academic as Dripa will be repealed in 10 days anyway.

However, it does have serious implications for the new snooper’s charter, the Investigatory Powers Act 2016 that includes the data retention powers the EU court has declared to be unlawful without the proper safeguards and which comes into force from 1 January.

The new state surveillance law includes a major extension of powers, including vast databases recording every website visited by the entire population. These databases can be accessed not just by the police and security services but by dozens of other public authorities, and in the case of communications data, without the need for suspicion of criminality or prior sign-off from a judge or other independent official. They include the NHS, Department for Work and Pensions and the Gambling Commission.

The ruling means ministers can no longer be certain that the new snooper’s charter will survive any privacy legal challenges in the British courts. The ruling is unlikely to mean that the Investigatory Powers Act is struck down by British judges, but it may well require further amendment.

Brexit campaigners may claim the ruling is evidence that staying in the EU undermines the fight against terrorism. But the judgment clearly says that the state is within its rights to conduct targeted digital surveillance to fight terrorism and serious crime as long as there are proper judicial safeguards.

Those who say ministers should just ignore the Luxembourg court ruling because Britain will soon be out of the EU will also be disappointed. Whether Britain is in or out of Europe, British judges will still be using this privacy benchmark to hold British ministers and their laws to account.

Any sweeping trade deals the EU wants to sign with other countries will have to be approved by member state governments, a senior EU lawyer has said, in an opinion that could deepen complications over Britain’s post-Brexit future.

Eleanor Sharpston QC, an advocate general at the European court of justice, argued in a ruling released on Wednesday that an EU trade deal with Singapore could only be finalised by the EU and member states, and not by Brussels institutions acting alone.

In practice, this means the deal may have to be ratified by at least 38 national and regional parliaments, including the EU’s 28 national parliaments, at least five regional and linguistic parliaments in Belgium and at least five upper houses, including those of Germany and Italy.

Sharpston’s opinion does not bind the Luxembourg-based court, which is expected to issue its judgment in early 2017. But the court follows the views of advocate generals in a majority of cases.



If her opinion prevails, the EU could find it trickier to sign wide-ranging free-trade agreements. Life would also be harder for the British government, as any post-Brexit trade deal with the bloc could potentially require the approval of at least 38 national parliaments.



This scenario could add years to finalising a trade deal, leaving the British government facing the nightmare possibility that any one regional or national assembly could block a deal.

A taste of the possible drama to come was hinted at earlier this year when the Walloon region of Belgium threatened to veto an EU-Canada trade deal following seven years of tortuous negotiations and legal drafting.

The current case hinges on whether an EU trade deal with Singapore can be finalised by the European commission alone, or whether the approval of national governments is also needed.



The European commission, which negotiates trade agreements on behalf of the EU’s 510 million people, argues it has the power to sign agreements. But national governments contend that the trade deal touches on national competences and requires their approval.



Sharpston said the Singapore agreement, under discussion since 2010, could only be concluded by the commission and member states together.



“While the advocate general notes that difficulties may arise from a ratification process involving all of the member states alongside the EU, she considers that that cannot affect the question of who has competence to conclude the agreement,” she wrote.



She distinguished between EU competences and national ones. The European commission may take comfort from the fact it was deemed to have exclusive power to negotiate trade agreements on a wide range of issues, including trade in goods and many services, foreign-direct investment, many intellectual property questions and competition policy.

But the commission must give member states a say if a trade agreement covers trade in transport services, aspects of public procurement, as well as provisions affecting labour, social or environmental policy, Sharpston said.



A European commission spokesperson said: “This is an important element contributing to the court’s reflection, so we are of course carefully analysing it. However, it must be clear that no definitive conclusions can be drawn until the court itself issues its final opinion.”



The EU currently has 34 trade agreements covering 60 countries. EU trade negotiators have embarked on 19 separate trade negotiations covering 52 countries, including the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership with the US, now put into the deep freeze following the election of Donald Trump.

These trade deals have evolved from relatively simple agreements centred on cutting tariffs to far-reaching accords covering everything from mutual recognition of environmental, safety and labour standards to public procurement.

As a result, national governments are increasingly challenging the EU’s sole competence to conclude such sweeping trade agreements, amid a growing public backlash against free trade and the power of obscure trade tribunals to settle disputes between governments and large corporations.

As the disturbances in Birmingham showed, our prison system is in urgent need of improvement. The justice secretary is surely right to emphasise the need both to restore stability and deliver reform. The recruitment of 2,500 extra prison officers will help make prisons the secure places expected by the public – and deliver the stability we need if reform is to become a reality.

With almost half of all prisoners currently returning to prison within a year of release, after committing more crimes and creating yet more victims, we need to do much more to break the destructive cycles of reoffending. Truss understands this. She is a radical reformer. The justice secretary, like her predecessor Michael Gove, understands that while prison reform may not be a shortcut to political popularity, simply locking people up and throwing away the key is not the answer. Our prisons are at capacity. Our prison governors and their staff are working with limited resources. Successive governments have hinted at reform. Truss is now determined to deliver action, not just words.

The work of prison officers is central to effective rehabilitation, and to changing prison culture. If a prison truly has rehabilitation at its core then it needs to have a consistent focus on it, on the wings and landings as well as in the workshops and classrooms.

Yet when most people think of prison officers, they don’t think of the officer in HMP Belmarsh teaching illiterate prisoners the basics of how to write a letter so they can start to learn; nor the officer in a women’s prison who recently persuaded a prisoner to reconnect with her estranged mother so that her children could live with their grandmother, rather than be taken into care; nor the officer in HMP Wandsworth who talked an offender down from suicide and then helped him formulate a plan to turn his life around.

Prison officers are no mere “turn-keys”, or glorified bouncers. They are the unsung heroes of public service work. Effective prison officers manage, protect and rehabilitate some extremely challenging individuals, people who teachers and social workers have often been unable to help.

The job of a prison officer is challenging and complex, and those who do the job well act as mentors, counsellors, and educators to some of the most difficult and vulnerable people in society. Turning around the life of an offender not only prevents future victims, it can also prevent intergenerational offending. Currently, 65% of boys with a convicted father go on to offend themselves.

Over the past decade, the prestigious scheme Teach First has encouraged many of our top graduates to start their careers in teaching. There are similar programmes for police, social workers, and adult mental health. Today, we are launching an ambitious programme to recruit some of Britain’s best graduates to work in our prisons – to help make a reality of rehabilitation.

Unlocked is a two-year graduate scheme that recognises the importance of the prison officer role, and will create a network of leaders to support a rehabilitation agenda. Our participants will have both impressive academic credentials and the personal attributes to be successful, such as interpersonal skills, resilience, and leadership potential. The programme will include initial training, as well as tailored additional on-the-job mentoring by existing prison officers. Throughout the two years, participants will also be studying for a master’s degree.

Our graduates will learn skills that no university can teach, and develop unique insight into how to help resolve some of society’s most challenging social issues. The programme will demand grit, strategic thinking, and the ability to handle extremely difficult situations. Our participants will be filling actual prison officer vacancies. They will develop expertise in communication, decision making, and complex problem solving. They will have the option to remain in the prison service, either as officers or as future senior leaders, or they may take up top posts elsewhere in the public or private sector.

Some will ask whether this is the right time to launch such a scheme. In our view it undoubtedly is. Truss is right that stability and reform must be delivered in tandem. Rehabilitation is not possible without stability. But only rehabilitation can break the cycle of crime.

An Idaho prosecutor’s declaration that an alleged rape of a black, mentally disabled football player with a coat hanger by his white team-mate was not a sex crime and was not racially motivated has sparked mounting criticism among campaigners against sexual assault.

John RK Howard was initially charged with felony forcible sexual penetration by use of a foreign object, but on Friday, the 19-year-old reached a plea bargain that allowed him to plead guilty to a felony count of injury to a child. The deal will allow Howard to avoid prison time unless he violates his probation, the Twin Falls Times-News reported.

The October 2015 assault drew national headlines after the victim told the court that he had been attacked by three football team-mates and sodomized with a coat hanger in the locker room.

The victim’s family filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against the high school and school officials, claiming that the school had failed to protect the student from a campaign of racial harassment by other students that culminated in the sexual assault.

The victim was called racial epithets such as “watermelon”, “chicken-eater”, and “nigger”, and Howard taunted the victim with a “Ku Klux Klan” song, the lawsuit alleged.

But during Friday’s hearing, the prosecutor, deputy attorney general Casey Hemmer, played down both the racial and sexual aspects of the crime, according to the Twin Falls Times-News.

Hemmer told the judge that the crime was not a sex crime and that Howard should not be treated as a sex offender, the paper reported. He also stated that his office did not believe that the crime was racially motivated.

R Keith Roark, one of the attorneys representing the victim in the civil case, said: “The plea agreement is an abomination, and the in-court comments of the prosecutor, if accurately reported, reflect a perverse compassion for the perpetrator of a sickening, violent act rather than a concern for the young man whose life has been turned upside down by group violence – which we believe was indeed, at least in part, racially motivated.

“How this can be anything other than a sexual assault is beyond my comprehension, and I have been prosecuting and defending sex crimes for 40 years,” Roark added.

“Deputy Attorney General Hemmer’s actions and statements dehumanizes the young man who was heinously penetrated and fuels and sanctions our culture of sexism, racism, able-ism, domination, aggression, and violence, and in turn, the Office of the Idaho Attorney General is complicit in state-sanctioned sexism, racism, able-ism and violence,” the Idaho Coalition Against Sexual & Domestic Violence wrote on Facebook.

“Nothing short of a complete retraction by the Attorney General of Hemmer’s outrageous actions and statements and immediate action against Hemmer will be acceptable,” the group added.

A spokesman for the Idaho attorney general’s office declined to comment on the plea or the prosecutor’s statements, citing a gag order imposed by the judge until Howard is sentenced in February 2017.

Lee Schlender, another attorney representing the victim in the civil case, said the victim’s parents were “outraged” by the plea bargain and the statements made by the prosecutor. Schlender said the parents of the victim had not been properly consulted about the plea bargain, and that the victim himself could not approve or disapprove of the deal because he was currently institutionalized.

“The father said he wanted to see these fellas spend some time in prison for what they did,” Schlender said, and referred to the proposed sentence of probation as a “slap on the wrist”.

“To say that this has nothing to do with the fact that he’s one of only one or two black children in the school, and he’s mentally disabled, and he’s the only one that had this happen to him – to say that this doesn’t have to do with race is just incomprehensible,” Schlender said.

Doctors should stop providing life support treatment to a former police officer and British army veteran who was left in a minimally conscious state after a road accident, a judge has ruled.

The wife of the Gulf war veteran Paul Briggs had asked the court of protection to allow her husband to die, saying he would have seen living in his current condition as torture and hell.

Briggs, 43, has been in a minimally conscious state since a motorcycle crash while serving with Merseyside police in July last year. The father of one, who is being treated at the Walton Centre in Liverpool, suffered a bleed on the brain, five fractures in his spine, bruising to internal organs and several other severe injuries in the collision.

Mr Justice Charles announced his decision on Tuesday after analysing evidence presented at a hearing in Manchester last month in the court of protection, where judges consider issues relating to people who lack the mental capacity to take decisions.

The judge agreed that it was not in Briggs’s best interests for treatment to continue, and that it was lawful to withdraw treatment. He recommended that Briggs be moved to a hospice to be given palliative care for the final weeks of his life.

Lawyers acting for Briggs through the government-appointed official solicitor’s office have asked for permission to appeal against the decision, so his treatment is likely to continue until the new year, when a decision will be made on whether the appeal can go ahead.

After the ruling, Briggs’s wife, Lindsey, said the court case had been the hardest thing she had ever had to do and that the past 18 months had been “extremely distressing and traumatic”. She thanked the judge and said he had been able to “place himself in Paul’s situation, and for that we will be forever thankful”.

“All our lives have been turned upside down,” she said, referring to their families, including five-year-old daughter, Ella. “We have been living in darkness and despair, from when Paul had the crash in the first place, through all the uncertainty, having to watch him suffer and be in pain, and all the endless procedures and complications.”

She said the family was dismayed to learn that the decision may be appealed. “We feel overwhelming despair and sorrow, but we know we have to try to somehow cope and continue for Paul,” she said. “Given this continued uncertainty, Christmas will now not be a peaceful occasion for us.”

Doctors had told the judge there was potential for Briggs to emerge from his minimally conscious state, but that the life expectancy of people in his condition was estimated to be nine to 10 years. Medical experts told the court that even in a best-case scenario, Briggs would remain severely physically disabled.



Lindsey Briggs told the hearing on 28 November that he did not recognise her or respond to her when she went to see him. “I think he would see it as torture, just as hell, that everything he believes in and he lives for would just be taken away from him. He would be living for no reason.”

She said that when she looked into his eyes she saw “at best, nothing there, or at worst, distress or suffering”.

Conrad Hallin, representing the Walton Centre NHS foundation trust and the Wirral clinical commissioning group, told the court doctors had noticed some signs of improvement in Briggs’s condition.

Normally, patients at the centre of court of protection litigation are not identified because judges aim to protect their privacy. But Briggs’s accident was widely reported and no one involved in the litigation had asked for him to remain anonymous so the judge allowed him to be named. 



Chelsea Rowe, 26, received a 12-month prison term in July after admitting causing serious injury to Briggs by dangerous driving. Liverpool crown court heard Rowe was driving a Nissan Micra that was in a head-on collision with Briggs’s motorcycle on the Birkenhead flyover.

Last week’s riot at HMP Birmingham and unrest at Hull was not the only bad news for the prison service this year – 2016 has also seen a record number of deaths behind bars, unprecedented levels of serious assaults and self-harm, rampant drug abuse and a spectacular breakout.

“If you don’t have safety, order and control in prisons you have nothing,” says Ian Acheson, 48, a former prison governor who earlier this year undertook the review of Islamic extremism in UK prisons. Acheson lays the blame for the crisis in our prison system firmly at the door of government. Since 2010, there has been a 30% cut in prison officer numbers, and there were 500 fewer frontline prison staff in 2016 alone.

“They should admit they got it wrong – that they cut frontline staff too far; that they understand that some of the consequences of those cuts have been this collapse in prison safety,” Acheson says.

The justice secretary, Liz Truss, last month announced the recruitment of an extra 2,500 prison officers to tackle violence. But, says Acheson, “there ought to be a bit of humility from the government. It needs to accept the policy of removing so many staff was disastrous.”

During Acheson’s review of radicalisation in jails – commissioned by the then justice secretary, Michael Gove – he visited dozens of prisons in Britain and abroad, and concluded that the rise of Islamic extremism in UK prisons was a “serious threat to national security”.

Recommendations included isolating those prisoners identified as presenting an “enduring risk to national security” in special units – “prisons within prisons” – away from the general prisoner population, as well as providing staff training, “with particular emphasis on distinguishing religious from cultural traditions”. These measures have both since been adopted by government.

Acheson insists that the separated regime accepted by the UK government differs fundamentally from the scheme he observed in France, which is now being abandoned, where prisoners deemed to be inspired by Islamic extremism were semi-segregated. “The conditions were extremely primitive, even by the poor standards we now see in UK prisons,” he says. “We envisaged a very small number of these prisoners being completely isolated in purpose-built units, where what I would call ‘enlightened’ separation occurs. These units should offer individualised treatment plans by highly trained staff – and the emphasis should be on humanising relationships between staff and prisoner to change their mindset.”

But surely you can’t contain or isolate an idea? “No. But you need to at least produce an alternative narrative – a counter narrative,” Acheson says. He suspects, however, that staff fear being accused of racism if they attempt to confront the problem.

“There is a legal obligation for institutions like prisons to promote British values. I don’t have any problem at all with British values, such as democracy, the rule of law and tolerance. When I was conducting my review, and spoke to people at senior level in the prison service about these values, some of them looked at me almost with disdain. One of them even said, ‘perhaps we’d call them European values’. That was one example of a cultural mindset that I observed in relation to Islamic extremism. There was what I call an institutional timidity, an unwillingness of the institution to directly confront this problem.”

He believes that the 12,500 Muslims in prison in England are probably most at risk from the threat of Islamic extremism. “They have mothers and daughters and sons and fathers outside, worrying about them being at risk in prison. But the prison service has frankly been asleep for the last six years in terms of understanding the nature and the extent of this problem, despite all of the evidence available to them to do something about it. But it went into the ‘too difficult’ box.

“If I was in prison I’d be making pragmatic decisions about my own safety; if there was a dominant gang that offered me protection, I would join them.”

There is no reason why the same principles of separation cannot apply to other extremists, Acheson believes, such as those peddling far-right views. “We cannot allow extremism of any kind to flourish in prisons,” he states.

For Acheson, however, anti-extremism training and separation have all been eclipsed by what he calls “the order and control crisis”.

“Short term we have to get stability back in prisons,” he says. “To borrow from the Iraq war, we need a ‘surge’ of staff into disordered prisons to restore control and get a decent regime going. Longer term, staff training needs a complete overhaul to equip them properly for the task of managing prisoners with diverse needs and characteristics.”

Over the six months that he and his team took evidence from staff, experts and former prisoners, he says he found staff who were on the edge. “I’ve seen scared staff, spoken to scared staff. Being in some prisons where you expect there to be control and seeing that there really isn’t any is something.” He says a way to lift morale would be to put prison governors in uniform. “The artificial distinction between management and shop floor has created a ‘them and us’ culture which must be ended,” he says. And the quality of the uniforms should be improved. “At the moment staff look like employees of a budget airline as opposed to professionals in a vital uniformed public service.”

Is there any hope that our prisons are ever going to work? “Prison does work because it incapacitates people who have committed crime. But if it’s only for that purpose, it will fail.” As a young prison officer in the 1990s, Acheson says he saw at HMP Grendon (the only therapeutic prison in the UK) what happens when you give people even a small degree of autonomy. “I’ve always believed that prisons ought to be places where we help people rescue their potential. I think a very small number of people are irredeemably broken, who frankly need to be contained – and society needs to be protected from them. But the vast majority need help. It is important to get services to people who are in need, to help them help themselves, but also to prevent them from creating any more victims.”

He says it’s about time prisoners were given meaningful work, paid the minimum wage and had a personal training and education voucher to let them select the training required for meaningful employment after release. And there should be a dramatic increase in in-cell access to remote learning and skills providers via a secure intranet.

Acheson says he loved working in prisons for nine years. “Being a prison officer is the career I am most proud of in my life. It was the making of me,” he explains. “I’ve always thought that prisons were places of possibility. In the 1990s there were lots of hopeful things happening. There was optimism. But if we want to solve the prison safety crisis we have now, we have to change the ratios. Either society decides that it has to have more prison officers, or fewer prisoners.”

An appeals court has found in favour of Google after a man claimed the search engine had defamed him by publishing photos of him linked to hardened criminals of Melbourne’s underworld.

Milorad Trkulja sued Google, arguing when search terms such as Melbourne criminal underworld photos and Melbourne underworld criminals were entered, images of him showed up.

He argued the search results put him in the same league as convicted murderer Carl Williams, underworld killer Andrew “Benji” Veniamin and drug kingpin Tony Mokbel.

Google tried unsuccessfully to have the case against it set aside on the grounds it had no real prospect of success. It argued it could not be held to be the publisher of the search results, because they were produced by the automated operation of a vast web search based on algorithms. Further, it argued the search results were incapable of being found to have defamed Trkulja.

On Tuesday, Victoria’s court of appeal ruled Google’s appeal should be allowed. “The appeal has a real, not fanciful, prospect of success,” the judges said.

The judges held that, as the case was put, Google could not be held to be publisher of the allegedly defamatory material. They also found the material on which Trkulja sued was not capable of conveying any defamatory meanings.

The judges acknowledged Trkulja could have argued his case in a way that enabled the appeal judges to find Google did publish the material, but he did not.

They noted the chance for a search engine to produce results that could defame someone was “acute”. But if search engines were to have immunity from liability for defamation, it should come from the parliament rather than the courts, they said.

Article 50 of the Lisbon treaty holds the key to leaving the European Union but its full meaning and consequences are open to interpretation.

As the British courts prepare to decide whether the government must consult parliament before invoking Article 50, the EU is preparing its institutions for the coming negotiations.

The backlog of uncollected court fines and surcharges in England and Wales has risen to £747m, according to the latest Ministry of Justice figures.



The sharp rise in courtroom-imposed debt over the past two years is substantially due to the ill-fated criminal courts charge, which was introduced by the former justice secretary Chris Grayling and abandoned after less than eight months.

While the amount recovered by the department has risen significantly over recent years, convicted offenders are facing increased demands for punitive payments.

The £747m figure is the MoJ’s estimate up to the end of September 2016, and compares with £680m at the end of December 2015. It includes fines imposed in magistrates and crown courts, compensation orders, costs orders, criminal courts charges, victim surcharge orders, and unpaid fixed penalty notices and penalty notices for disorder that are registered as fines for enforcement.



Between the financial years 2011-12 and 201516, fines and charges imposed annually by courts in England and Wales rose from £385m to £598m. Over the same period, sums collected have risen from £279m to £381m a year.

The surge in uncollected debt was highlighted by the Liberal Democrats. Tim Farron, the party’s leader, said: “What’s deeply concerning is that the amount left uncollected by the government is £747m. This is a very worrying trend, and we need to increase collection rates.

“This is a sizeable sum of money that could, and should, have been put to good use by the state. Imagine how many schools or hospitals could be built or police officers, social workers or soldiers could be employed with that cash – it’s frankly scandalous.” 



Those convicted face a formidable array of financial penalties. Offenders not only have to shell out for any fines imposed on them, but they may have to meet the expense of Crown Prosecution Service costs and are also liable for the victim surcharge.

 Grayling introduced the criminal courts charge in April 2015. It required convicted criminals to pay an additional charge of between £150 and £1,200 towards the cost of their case.

The extra costs provoked mass protest resignations by magistrates who refused to impose the new charge. They argued that many defendants would never be able to pay their accumulated fines. In December last year Grayling’s successor, Michael Gove, abolished the criminal courts charge. The sums imposed during that eight-month period still appear as uncollected on MoJ records, however.

The victim surcharge, introduced in 2007, started off at a flat £15 but has been progressively raised so that it now stands at a maximum of £170. It may explain the fresh increase in uncollected courtroom debt over the past year.

Penelope Gibbs, a former magistrate who is director of the charity Transform Justice, said the steep rise in the backlog of uncollected fines may also be linked to an era of austerity that has left many defendants without the resources to pay.

She added: “Publicity over the imposition of the criminal court charge may have undermined the credibility of the whole system of fines.”

Ben Summerskill, director of the Criminal Justice Alliance, said: “The whole of HMCTS [Her Majesty’s Courts and Tribunal Service] is in chaos at the moment. There’s no question that the criminal courts charge imposed fines on people who had no means to pay them. 



“It was a quixotic attempt to square the public finances that was drawn up without any thought about its implementation.”

A spokesperson for HMCTS said: “We take the recovery and enforcement of court fines extremely seriously and our performance is improving. Last year we collected a record £381m – an increase of over £110m since 2010 – and the number of those fined not meeting their repayment terms has fallen by around a third in the last five years.”

The private security company G4S will have to foot the bill for the public sector Tornado special squads sent in to end the 12-hour riot at its Birmingham prison, the justice secretary has said.



An inquiry has been launched into one of the worst prison disturbances since the 1990 riots at Manchester’s Strangeways prison. After Friday’s events, 380 prisoners have been moved out of the wrecked wings of HMP Birmingham to other jails across England.

The dispersal of prisoners led to two incidents at Hull prison on Sunday and a further incident at Cardiff. The Prison Service’s “gold command” headquarters operation is remaining in place, monitoring all prisons in England and Wales for signs of potential unrest.

Liz Truss told MPs that insufficient staffing levels, a rise in new psychoactive drugs, gangs and bullying lay at the root of the Birmingham riot, adding they were common problems across public and private prisons: “The next few months will be difficult,” the justice secretary told MPs. “It will take time and concerted action, but I am confident we can turn this situation around.”

Labour MPs pressed Truss over whether warnings from the independent monitoring board at Birmingham had been acted on. They questioned her about the impact of a £700m budget cut and a reduction of 7,000 prison officers on the stability of the Prison Service.

Labour’s justice spokesman, Richard Burgon, said the riot should prompt the government to review the running of prisons by private companies such as G4S and Serco.

Truss said G4S would have to pay the cost of the public resources that were used, including 10 Tornado teams of highly trained officers deployed to retake control of the prison.

She told MPs that the Birmingham riot started at 9.15am on Friday, when six prisoners in N wing climbed on to netting. Truss said: “When staff intervened, one them had their keys snatched. At that point, staff withdrew for their own safety. Prisoners then gained control of the wing and subsequently of P wing.

“G4S immediately deployed two Tornado teams. At 11.29am, gold command was opened, and a further seven additional Tornado teams were dispatched to the prison. At 1.30pm, prisoners gained access to two more wings. Gold command made the decision that further reinforcements were needed and dispatched an additional four Tornado teams to the prison.”

She said that paramedics and staff tried to help an injured prisoner shortly after 3pm but were prevented from doing so and the afternoon was spent preparing to take back control of the wings.

“At 8.35pm, 10 Tornado teams of highly trained officers swept through the wings,” she said. “Shortly after 10pm, the teams had secured all four wings. The prisoner who had previously been reported injured was treated by paramedics and taken to hospital, along with two other prisoners.”

The inquiry into the prison riot will be carried out by Sarah Payne, an adviser to the chief inspector of probation and a former director of the Welsh Prison Service.

Although Truss repeatedly refused to confirm that she had read the Birmingham prison watchdog’s report in October, which warned of the need for urgent action to tackle understaffing and the spread of “black mamba” psychoactive drugs, she said the issues had been discussed with the prison governor.

The justice secretary’s Commons statement followed a renewed warning from the president of the independent monitoring board, John Thornhill, that insufficient staff numbers lay behind the rising levels of violence in prisons in England and Wales.

“It is the board’s view, echoed by prison staff, that there are insufficient staff numbers to deal with many of the day-to-day situations that occur in a local prison … The result, as we have seen in recent weeks, is an increase in riots that damage the system individuals,” he said.

“The impact of this unrestrained violence is that a large number of prisoners have to be transferred to other prisons that are already stretched with their own problems and staffing issues.”

Truss will publish a prison and courts bill in the new year to introduce wide-ranging reform and to build on the recruitment of 2.500 extra prison officers.

A California agency that oversees judicial discipline in the state says a judge committed no misconduct when he sentenced former Stanford University swimmer Brock Turner to six months in jail for sexually assaulting a young woman on campus.

The California commission on judicial performance ruled on Monday that there was no evidence that Santa Clara County judge Aaron Persky displayed bias in handing down a sentence decried as too lenient by critics across the country.

“The commission has concluded that there is not clear and convincing evidence of bias, abuse of authority, or other basis to conclude that Judge Persky engaged in judicial misconduct warranting discipline,” the 11-member panel concluded in its unsigned ruling.

Turner’s case exploded on social media and ignited a debate about campus rape and the criminal justice system after the victim’s 7,200-word letter that she read in the courtroom during sentencing was published online.

The commission said it received thousands of complaints and petitions regarding Persky and the sentence.

The petitions included complaints that Persky “displayed gender bias and failed to take sexual assault of women seriously”, and showed favoritism to Turner because the judge was a former Stanford athlete as well.

The 21-year-old was released from jail in September after serving three months. He will be on probation for three years in his native Ohio and is a registered sex offender.

Persky is the target of a recall campaign launched by Stanford law professor Michele Landis Dauber, who said in a statement on Monday that the recall effort would continue.

“This report simply highlights what we have been saying from the beginning,” the statement read, “which is that a petition for judicial discipline was not the correct venue to address these concerns, and the recall is the only realistic way to remove Judge Persky from office.”

“Judge Persky has a long record of failing to take violence against women seriously, and we will demonstrate that when we launch the campaign early next year,” Dauber said.

Turner was convicted of assaulting the woman behind a dumpster after they drank heavily at a fraternity party. The woman had passed out and Turner was on top of her when confronted by two graduate students passing by on bicycles. They chased and tackled him when he tried to flee, holding him on the ground until police arrived.



A jury in March found Turner guilty of three felony sexual assault counts. Persky sentenced him to six months in jail, citing the “extraordinary circumstances” of Turner’s youth, clean criminal record and other considerations in departing from the minimum sentence of two years in prison. Prosecutors had argued for six years.

There is little to be said for the strike stopping some customers getting their Christmas presents in the post, nor the ones threatened by British Airways cabin staff and baggage handlers at many of the UK’s airports that threaten long-planned festive breaks, nor for the long-running dispute that is making the lives of commuters in parts of south-east England so miserable. But they are not the start of a wild-eyed workers’ insurgency, as some overexcited reports have suggested in the past few days. Nor, whether or not they achieve their legitimate aim of protecting their members’ interests, are they helping the wider trade union movement to find a new relevance and authority as membership declines in a rapidly changing economy.

There will possibly be a third more days lost to strikes in 2016 than in 2015. But last year was exceptionally peaceful on the industrial front, the most peaceful since 2005. The total of lost days for 2016 is still historically low. The point of this unnecessary row is that in some quarters, although it would seem not in Downing Street, there is still an appetite for more union-bashing laws. Some backbenchers hanker after the ultimate objective of the anti-union right since the Trade Disputes Act of 1906 reversed the Taff Vale judgment, removing trade union immunity from damages – thus effectively making industrial action impossible. This is daft on every front, not least because there would be no majority for it in parliament; the government was forced to make serial concessions on the trade union act, which is due to come into force next March. It already significantly narrows the possibilities of a strike by requiring not only a majority in favour of strike action, but a turnout of at least 50% of those entitled to vote. If parliament approves more regulations next month, it will also ban strike action in “important public services”, including the railways, unless it is backed by more than 40% of those entitled to vote.

What workers need is not more legislation to curb trade unions, but a trade union movement that is modern and responsive to the needs of the world where most people work. Trade union members tend to be older, better off and work in the old public sector. In the private sector, union membership is below 15%. If unions can’t find a way to reach younger workers to whom the tradition of collective action is unfamiliar, they are doomed to a slow death. Half of all jobs growth is among the self-employed. This is an audience that is deterred rather than attracted by old white men sounding antagonistic towards their employers.

Last year the union Community, which has set out to recruit self-employed people as well as a wide range of other workers, conducted research that found, if offered help by a trade union, a mere 19% would sign up. Offered similar help from an independent source, 75% would take up the offer. The union’s latest project is with Indycube, an organisation that sets up co-work spaces in redundant offices. Community wants to offer the self-employed not traditional union services but advice on contracts or slow payers. Others look across the Atlantic to movements like the minimum wage campaign Fight for $15, which began with a trade unionist, David Rolf, and has become a nationwide social movement organising for decent pay in sectors like fast food and social care. Workers need a strong, clear voice as much now as they ever had.

Dogs are property and cannot be considered in the same vein as children, a Canadian judge has ruled, in a scathing decision that blasted a newly separated couple for a “ridiculous” attempt to use the court system to settle a custody dispute over two of their dogs.



The childless couple, who separated in April after 16 years of marriage, turned to the court system earlier this year to settle a row over where two of their three dogs would live.

The initial application to the court was made by the husband, who wanted to keep one of the couple’s dogs.

Lawyers for the wife – who pointedly described her estranged husband as a “cat person” in court documents – pushed the court to consider the matter as they would any other custody issue, urging the judge to allow the dogs, aged 9 and 2, to live with her and grant visitation rights to her husband.

Any similarity between children and pets was roundly rejected by the judge. “Many dogs are treated as members of the family with whom they live,” Justice Richard Danyliuk wrote in his decision, issued in August and which came to light this week after a report by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. “But after all is said and done, a dog is a dog. At law it is property, a domesticated animal that is owned. At law it enjoys no familial rights.”

While he acknowledged that pets can differ from other property in that statutory protection exists to prevent them from being treated with cruelty or neglect, he drew the line at applying the principles of child custody to animals.

He pointed to the differences in how society treats dogs and children to explain his reasoning. “In Canada, we tend not to purchase our children from breeders,” he wrote. “In turn, we tend not to breed our children with other humans to ensure good bloodlines, nor do we charge for such services … When our children act improperly, even seriously and violently so, we generally do not muzzle them or even put them to death for repeated transgressions.”

Since the couple’s separation, the dogs – named Kenya and Willow, or Willy for short – have been staying with the parents of the wife.

For the time being, said the judge, the dogs should remain where they are. He likened the matter to being asked to rule on what the couple should do with other joint property they may own. “Am I to make an order that one party have interim possession of (for example) the family butter knives but, due to a deep attachment to both butter and those knives, order that the other party have limited access to those knives for 1.5 hours per week to butter his or her toast?” Justice Danyliuk wrote. “A somewhat ridiculous example, to be sure, but one that is raised in response to what I see as a somewhat ridiculous application.”

In a court system plagued with delays, where many are forced to wait months to hear applications relating to child welfare and other family matters, he slammed the couple for tying up valuable resources. While he was sure that the couple felt the living arrangement of their dogs was a “most important matter”, he urged them to consider the bigger picture. “To consume scarce judicial resources with this matter is wasteful.”

The couple was taking a substantial risk in pursuing this matter in court, he warned. “Both parties should bear in mind that if the court cannot reach a decision on where the dogs go, it is open to the court under the legislation to order them sold and the proceeds split – something I am sure neither party wants.”

Ultimately he dismissed the application, pressing the pair to sort out the dispute themselves and leave the court to other matters. “Simply put,” said the judge, “I am not about to make what amounts to a custody order pertaining to dogs.”

There is a contradiction in the argument that more prison officers will mean less trouble inside (Editorial, 19 December). The history of modern prison disturbances in England and Wales – from Parkhurst in 1969 through to Strangeways in 1990 – indicates that they occur for complex reasons. These prisons, and the others where disturbances have taken place in the last four decades, had their full complement of staff. Other disturbances occurred in prisons that were neither overcrowded nor privatised, and well-resourced financially. It is therefore crucial to get to the root of why prisoners revolt when they know, in Liz Truss’s cliched phrase, they “will face the full force of the law”. Prisoners knowing they faced the same consequences have not been deterred from revolting during this time. The point made by Frantz Fanon, cited by Black Lives Matter, can be applied to the prisons here: “We revolt simply because, for many reasons, we can no longer breathe”. Responding to what happened at Birmingham as a law and order issue, seeking retribution and dismissing critics as being pro-crime and anti-victim, will undoubtedly fail and have potentially catastrophic consequences for everyone inside.

• Prisons are shameful places, often violent, dangerous and squalid. So of course they are a problem. But the real problem is not prisons but imprisonment, one endpoint in the criminal justice system. Prisons have no control over their own business. They simply have to do what they can with what the courts send them, and the courts send them what sentencing policy requires. Brave new thinking is needed. What is imprisonment supposed to achieve? If we know, are there better ways of achieving it? If sentences are needed, how long should they be? Liz Truss’s only response so far has been to recruit more prison officers, but doing that (even if she can) will address none of the confusions around imprisonment.

• Our prisons are full and the prospect of recruiting enough staff to properly look after prisoners is months, if not years, away. So we need to reduce the numbers in prison in England and Wales. Scotland has already succeeded in reducing numbers, but it needs political will. One issue to address is ever-longer prison sentences – in England and Wales we have fewer people going to prison, but their prison sentences are longer than 10 years ago for the same crimes. Yet there is no evidence that these longer sentences are either more effective or a deterrent. The reasons for sentence inflation are complex, but sentencing guidelines, the decline of sentence appeals and punitive rhetoric may all be to blame. The government could take action on all these without endangering public safety in any way.

• The Guardian was strangely muted at the time Chris Grayling was pushing through the privatisation of the probation service, as if you too were convinced it was failing and indifferent to its fate as a respected and necessary public body. It is good to see you acknowledge that this was a foreseeable catastrophe (Editorial, 16 November).

The service was not failing, and many of the problems it had were the consequence of sustained government mismanagement and misguided target-setting, rather than internal incompetence. There is a clear evidence base for doing probation well, and there were, back in 2014, a cohort of managers and officers perfectly capable of delivering this, although many have now left their broken and demoralised profession.

The community rehabilitation companies that took over the probation trusts have been short-changed, literally, by Grayling, who brazenly overestimated the numbers they would get to supervise in order to attract their business. “Payment by results” is a fiasco, and the companies cannot afford to keep their third-sector partners on board. They are not coming clean about all that is going wrong, some may break their contracts, and the Ministry of Justice is doing its level best to silence critics.

Could the Guardian now throw the weight of its investigative resources into exposing this catastrophe in full? Public safety has been jeopardised by it, but beyond the specifics of that, exposure would reveal – all cost-efficiency rhetoric apart – how cynical the motives and wasteful the methods of privatisation actually are.

• Your otherwise excellent editorial outlining the disastrous consequences for offender rehabilitation of Chris Grayling’s political decision-making for ideological purposes falls into the trap of suggesting that probation was widely considered to be failing in 2012. This is not true, as the Ministry of Justice’s own 2013 report highlighted that the performance of the then 35 probation trusts was either good or excellent against the national target framework. Indeed, many trusts had also received national and international recognition for their business excellence. The truth is that from the creation of a National Probation Service in 2001, which retained its strong local accountability through local boards and then trusts, Labour and then the coalition administration were concerned with central control and the move to privatisation. As early as 2003, the Carter report recommended the segmentation of service delivery so that privatisation and central control of what remained could be facilitated. It is Labour’s 2007 Offender Management Act that has provided the basis for the folly of the Tories’ Transforming Rehabilitation.

Every single home secretary and justice secretary since 2001 has taken the opportunity to attack probation, whether it was John Reid describing it as not fit for purpose or Ken Clarke suggesting that the 2011 riots were the consequences of failed offender rehabilitation. The real issue is not one of supposed failure but why a public service with a proud 107-year history, respected and emulated across Europe and beyond, has been regularly attacked. I can only conclude that decency, compassion and humanity towards those who commit crimes and the belief that with sustained assistance people can turn their lives round is now too old-fashioned and stands in the way of profits for global businesses.

• While I agreed with the majority of your editorial, it was, like the Grayling agenda which it criticised, based upon a false premise. It stated that “in 2012 the probation service was widely considered to be failing. Few questioned the need for reform”. This is completely incorrect on both points: firstly the majority of probation trusts in England and Wales had been performing extremely well, indeed had achieved standards of excellence at that time, and secondly there were large numbers of people and organisations, the majority experts in the field, questioning the need for the so-called Transforming Rehabilitation agenda, which Grayling bulldozed through without any evidence base.

Community sentences managed by probation services had achieved a lower conviction rate than custodial sentences. It was the short-term prison sentences which resulted in the highest reconviction rate, and at the time of Grayling’s intervention probation services had no remit, except in the 18-21 age group, to manage these on release. Grayling spoke of a “revolving door” of custody and destroyed probation for not reducing reoffending in a group that they were not tasked to work with. Probation services were carved up by Grayling and a large section sold off to private companies. He and his team also had no understanding of the dynamic nature of risk, and those assessed as low and medium risk of causing harm are placed with the private companies, and high risk with the civil service section of probation. Statistics show that the majority of serious further offences come from the low- to medium-risk groups, and serious case reviews have counselled against increasing the number of agencies involved with risky individuals and the communication problems caused. Several private companies have disposed of professionally trained staff, seeing them as too expensive.

Having worked as a probation officer from 1981 to 2014, I have been heartbroken to see the shambles that the world of probation has now become. Most of my contemporaries have now also left their jobs as workloads have increasingly become untenable. Younger colleagues have either left to work in new fields or are currently struggling on in very difficult circumstances. Workloads across the board have now become unmanageable. This is both due to high numbers and the nature of the caseloads, coupled with convoluted systems of communication between public and private sector.

Grayling has destroyed a high-performing service and a profession. The revolving door he spoke of between short-term prison sentences and reoffending just got faster.

Italian prosecutors have suggested for the first time that a man accused of being one of the world’s most-wanted people smugglers may in fact be the victim of mistaken identity, in an embarrassing blow to a high-profile investigation led by Britain’s National Crime Agency.

In June, Italian and British officials claimed to have helped arrest Medhanie Yehdego Mered, one of the alleged masterminds behind the smuggling of thousands of people from north Africa to Europe.

After being extradited from Sudan to Italy, the alleged smuggler faced two prosecutions, first in Sicily and then in Rome, despite a series of Guardian articles that revealed doubts about the identity of the man in custody.

Six months later, some of the prosecutors have suggested that the wrong man may have been arrested, after the prosecution team in Rome broke ranks with their Sicilian colleagues. In a 23-page document submitted to court officials, the Rome prosecutors wrote: “This prosecution office have good grounds to state that the real physical aspect of Medhanie Yehdego Mered is the one shown in the attached photo,” referring to a picture of a man who differs substantially in appearance to the man in custody in Sicily.

To bolster their argument, the Rome prosecutors then cited testimony by a prosecution witness, an alleged former customer of Mered, who said the man in the photograph was the real smuggler, rather than the man on trial in Sicily. According to the prosecutors’ document, Seifu Haile, 28, said: “This is Medhanie [Mered]. He is the king in Libya, very respected by everyone.”

The document corroborates reporting by the Guardian, which suggests that the man in custody is in fact Medhanie Tesfarmariam Berhe, an Eritrean refugee with no connection to Mered’s alleged business. The Guardian has previously published testimony from other alleged Mered customers, all of whom said the Italian and British police had made a mistake. Mered has himself also said in Facebook messages published by the Guardian that the wrong man is on trial in his place.

The news causes considerable embarrassment for Britain’s NCA, GCHQ, and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, all of whom played a part in the alleged smuggler’s arrest. Court documents show that the NCA’s representative in north Africa, Roy Godding, played a key role in the extradition, while the NCA boasted on its website in June that it had tracked Mered to an address in Khartoum. At the time, the FCO said its own role was crucial to proceedings.

Berhe remains in custody until at least 10 January, while a Sicilian court assesses the Rome prosecutors’ claims, which have been contested by their Sicilian counterparts. Asked about the case by the Guardian, the Sicilian prosecutors refused to comment.

The NCA said it was “confident in our intelligence”.

Berhe’s lawyer Michele Calantropo said: “The prosecutors in Palermo have [contested] the document produced by their colleagues in Rome. It’s very bizarre. And in the meantime an innocent man is going to spend Christmas in jail.”

On Monday, an Italian MP spoke out about the case for the first time, and announced a parliamentary inquiry. Erasmo Palazzotto, a leftwing MP and vice-president of the national commission for foreign affairs, said he hoped the inquiry would “accelerate the investigation and make sure that we are not keeping in jail an innocent man that might be the victim of a mistaken identity”.

When Donald Trump swears at the inauguration that he will “faithfully execute the office of president of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the constitution of the United States”, he will be committing a violation of constitutional magnitude.

The US constitution flatly prohibits any “Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under [the United States]” from accepting “any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State”. 



Known as the emoluments clause, this provision was designed on the theory that a federal officeholder who receives something of value from a foreign power can be tempted to compromise what the constitution insists be his exclusive loyalty: the best interest of the United States. The clause applies to the president and covers even ordinary, fair market value transactions with foreign states and their agents that result in any profit or benefit. That a hostile government has gotten its money’s worth from our president is obviously no defense to a charge that he has abused his office. 



Trump’s continued interest in the Trump Organization and his steady stream of monetary and other benefits from foreign powers put him on a collision course with the emoluments clause. Disentangling every improper influence resulting from special treatment of Trump’s business holdings by foreign states would be impossible. The American people would be condemned to uncertainty, leaving our political discourse rife with accusations of corruption. These problems are exacerbated by the fact that Trump has regularly declined to make his business dealings or tax returns transparent.

Thus a specter of skewed incentives will haunt a Donald Trump presidency. 



While much has changed since the constitution was written, certain premises of politics and human nature have held steady. Among them is that private financial interests can subtly sway even the most virtuous leaders. As Alexander Hamilton wrote in Federalist 22: “One of the weak sides of republics, among their numerous advantages, is that they afford too easy an inlet to foreign corruption.” The framers sought to avoid these ends by avoiding these beginnings, writing a broad ban on potentially corrupting foreign influence into article I of our nation’s charter.

By imposing clear limitations, the clause avoids situations in which the American people must search for hints of improperly motivated presidential favoritism toward selected foreign powers, or of foreign attempts to seduce the American president into compromising our national interest for his private profit. 



With Trump, this search has already begun. His global business empire creates ideal conditions for ongoing violations of the emoluments clause. Mere weeks before Trump spoke by phone with the president of Taiwan – a dramatic departure from America’s “one China” policy – a businesswoman associated with his conglomerate reportedly arrived in Taiwan to inquire about major new investments in luxury hotels. Trump’s businesses owe hundreds of millions to Deutsche Bank, which is currently negotiating a multibillion-dollar settlement with the US Department of Justice – a settlement that will now be overseen by an attorney general selected by and serving at the pleasure of Trump.

In his last public press conference, Trump called on Russia to hack Hillary Clinton and release her personal emails. Recently, both the FBI and CIA determined that the highest levels of Russia’s government in fact ran a covert operation aimed at helping Trump’s campaign, making his victory in the electoral college more likely.

The bottom line is simple: Trump stands to benefit personally, in innumerable and largely hidden ways, from decisions made daily by foreign governments and their agents. History teaches that leaders with divided interests cannot be counted on to faithfully serve those who elected them. 



The framers understood this lesson. The emoluments clause was forged of their hard-won wisdom. No relic of a bygone era, it is a profound expression of insight into the nature of the human condition and the preconditions of sovereign self-government. 



Trump’s shifting proposals for addressing his multifarious conflicts of interests are simply inadequate. If he retains an ownership interest in his empire, his personal bottom line is necessarily affected by everything his business does, whether or not he is at the helm.



Nor is a supposedly “blind trust” involving control of Trump’s assets by his adult children remotely sufficient. It is inconceivable that he could avoid discussing with them at least some matters relating to his policies and their business ventures, or that he could avoid noticing and caring about their interactions with foreign nations. 



So even full divestment of his personal ownership and control of the Trump Organization is no remedy for his emoluments clause violation: it is often to the prince and not the king that special favors are done.

Because Trump would take office in blatant violation of the constitution, the electoral college would be fully justified in concluding that he is unsuited to the presidency. As Justice Robert Jackson wrote 64 years ago, electors must be considered free to vote their conscience.

If Trump deliberately declines to cure his continuing violation of the emoluments clause upon entering office, Congress has both power and responsibility to enforce the constitution. It would be well within its rights to impeach and remove him for engaging in “high crimes and misdemeanors”.

Short of that awesome step, Congress might set lasting, bipartisan precedent by requiring all presidents to divest assets that risk conflicts of interest and to place the proceeds in a truly blind trust, and by creating a private cause of action explicitly allowing competitors disadvantaged by the president’s acceptance of unlawful benefits to file emoluments clause suits against the president in his personal capacity.

The looming constitutional shadow cast by a Trump presidency poses a frightening risk to our national security and gravely disserves the people of the United States.

Indian police are torturing suspects – including using sexual abuse, forms of waterboarding and beatings with a “truth-seeking belt” – a Human Rights Watch investigation has claimed.

A report released by the rights group on Monday says more than 590 suspects died in police custody between 2010 and 2015, and though mistreatment was alleged in many cases, no police officers have been convicted in that time.

Rules intended to curb the number of deaths in custody, such as bringing a suspect before a magistrate within 24 hours of their arrest, were routinely ignored, it says.

In one case highlighted in the report, police said a man named Shyamu Singh killed himself in custody in April 2012. But his brother, who was also arrested, told investigators the pair were held down by four officers while another “poured water down my nose continuously”.

“Once they stopped on me, they started on Shyamu,” he said. “Shyamu fell unconscious. So they started worrying and talking among themselves that he is going to die. One of the men got a little packet and put the contents in Shyamu’s mouth.”

Police told Singh’s family that he had died by consuming poison. An internal investigation cleared police of any involvement in his death, but an initial inquiry by state authorities concluded that seven police officers had tortured and poisoned the 35-year-old to death. Nonetheless, all seven were exonerated in the final report.

In another case, one of 17 featured in the report, a police head constable admitted that a suspect in a counterfeiting investigation had been beaten with a satyashodhak patta, or “truth-seeking belt”.

“Since he was a hardcore criminal, he refused to give any information on the source of those fake currency notes seized from him. But it was essential to get that information from him,” Atmaram Gurav is quoted as saying in the report.

“He was so weak after the beating that when he got up to drink water, he was dizzy with pain and collapsed against the window, breaking his lower jaw.”

Procedures to investigate deaths in custody are regularly flouted, the report says. Less than a third of the 97 deaths in 2015 led to a judicial inquiry, and in 26 cases no autopsy was conducted.

The New York-based rights group says there are police oversight bodies to investigate such cases, but they have “largely failed” in their role.

More than 430 cases of deaths in police custody were reported to India’s National Human Rights Commission between April 2012 and June 2015. The NHRC recommended more than a total of 22m rupees (£260,000) compensation in the cases, but no prosecutions.

“Police in India will learn that beating suspects to confess is unacceptable only after officers are prosecuted for torture,” said Meenakshi Ganguly, Human Rights Watch’s south Asia director.

The report makes several recommendations including that India set up a witness protection programme to encourage victims of police violence to come forward without fear of retribution.

Italian prosecutors: wrong man may have been arrested in smuggling case

France is considering appointing an official internet ombudsman to regulate complaints about online material in order to prevent excessive censorship and preserve free speech.

A bill establishing a “content qualification assessment procedure” has been tabled in the French senate and the initiative was debated last week at a high level meeting attended by senators and judges as well as policy officers from Google and Twitter.

The aim is to provide a simple procedure that will support firms operating online who are uncertain of their legal liabilities and to prevent over-zealous removal or censorship of material merely because it is the subject of a complaint. It could be copied by other European jurisdictions.

Dan Shefets, a Danish lawyer who works in Paris has developed the proposal with the French senator Nathalie Goulet, said: “The problem which an internet ombudsman addresses applies to all countries in Europe [because] member states have to work with the e-commerce directive.

“According to the directive, internet service providers (ISPs) face both penal and civil liability as soon as they are made aware of allegedly illicit content. One consequence of such liability is that smaller companies take down such content for fear of later sanctions.

“The risk to freedom of speech is real and significant as a consequence not only of the directive, but also of growing pressure on ISPs all over Europe and the world for that matter”.

The idea is that a rapid response from the internet ombudsman, whose office would need to be appropriately staffed, would either order the material to be taken down or allow it to remain. As long as ISPs complied with the rulings, they would not face any fine or punishment.

David Wright, of the UK Safer Internet Centre, said the closest existing model was Australia’s e-safety commissioner which provides a complaints service for children experiencing cyber-bullying.

Shefets, who founded the Association for Accountability and Internet Democracy (AAID) in 2014, is also working with Unesco to develop the project particularly to deal with material deemed to be encouraging radicalisation.

He is also planning to present his scheme to the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe. Shefets became interested in regulating online complaints after taking a case against Google in 2014 which resulted in the US firm being fined €1,000 a day until an online defamatory article was removed.

He believes an internet ombudsman will help smaller companies that cannot afford large legal departments to assess the risks of material they host online. “It would help them compete against the big players, who already have massive legal departments and access to lawyers without any financial difficulties,” he explained.

“If we don’t put in place some sort of mechanism which will protect freedom of speech while at the same time increasing accountability, it will be too easy to justify repressive [legislative] regimes.”

The riot in Birmingham prison last Friday, which at its height involved more than a third of the prison’s 1,450 inmates, was the worst since the Strangeways riot in Manchester 26 years ago. Moving the perpetrators out of Birmingham so that repairs can begin has put the stability of other prisons on a knife edge. As the justice secretary, Liz Truss, who will make a statement to MPs on Monday, acknowledged last month when she announced that an extra 2,500 officers were to be recruited, many of Britain’s prisons are dangerously understaffed and experiencing unprecedented levels of violence; Birmingham’s annual monitoring report emphasised just those problems. This crisis, like other crises in the public services, has been years in the making. As Britain enters its seventh year of austerity, there is no respite in sight. But prisons offer a real chance to show how to do more with less.

The chairman of the parole board, Nick Hardwick, who was until January the chief inspector of prisons, warned in a BBC interview on Sunday that the current balance between prison population and the number of officers was unworkable, and that on their own the new officers were not enough. More than 7,000 prison officers have gone since 2010 when Ken Clarke became justice secretary and promised a revolution in rehabilitation. Mr Clarke wanted shorter sentences – he proposed halving the sentences of offenders who entered guilty pleas – and a cut in reoffending, to reduce the prison population by 3,000. He offered up cuts of £2bn to the Treasury, nearly a quarter of the department’s £9bn budget; and by early 2013 the figures showed the first fall in prison numbers since the 1990s. But by then Mr Clarke had been replaced by Chris Grayling, with a brief to be tough on punishment, and numbers started to rise again, without any reverse to the shrinking budgets.

After Mr Grayling came Michael Gove, who spoke persuasively about the need for reform. But there was no change in the state of Britain’s prisons – now routinely condemned by the prisons inspectorate, who describe crumbling buildings and rat and cockroach infestations. There are not enough staff, and many are relatively new recruits, so in most jails few prisoners are constructively occupied; many are locked up almost all day, every day. In the year to June, 105 inmates killed themselves. At the same time there is a huge increase in the availability of psychoactive drugs, sometimes flown in by drones, that greatly exacerbate levels of violence. In the words of Peter Clark, Mr Hardwick’s successor as chief inspector, in his first annual report, “the grim situation [described in Mr Hardwick’s last report] has not improved, and in some key areas it has, if anything, become even worse”.

This is the mess that Liz Truss inherited when she was made justice secretary by Theresa May in July. Last month she unveiled a modest plan for reform, and some experts applaud her efforts to get a grip on a fast-deteriorating situation. She persuaded the chancellor, Philip Hammond, to release the cash for the extra staff announced in November. But they will take months to recruit and train – and, as the weekend’s events show, time is one of the commodities she does not have. In those circumstances, she was ill-advised, when she launched her prison reform white paper in early November, to rule out reviving the changes that Mr Clarke was forced to drop four years ago.

She expressly ruled out what she called “arbitrary reductions” to the prison population. That sounds as if she is resisting the demand now made by every one of her predecessors since 2005 to review the cases of the more than 3,000 offenders held on indeterminate sentences for public protection, even though some were originally imprisoned for minor offences and have been detained for far longer than the maximum sentence. Instead she restates the official line that reducing reoffending is the way to cut prisoner numbers. That is a pledge which sounds increasingly hollow in the face of the chief inspector of probation’s criticism last week of some of the private providers who run probation services.

In the Commons Ms Truss will almost certainly pledge to bring down the full force of the law against inmates involved in the Birmingham riot. But that means more prisoners in prison for longer – and the cost is high, yet the regime that is threatening the stability of many more prisons remains unchanged. Almost all prisons are operating at or near 100% capacity. This is just not sustainable. Ms Truss must think again about early release. Prison isn’t working.

Hull prison is on the brink of riot and has been put on lockdown after CCTV cameras were allegedly set alight by 15 inmates who took part in the large-scale disorder at HMP Birmingham, the chair of the Prison Officers’ Association has said. 



Mike Rolfe said trouble flared after the prisoners arrived at the category B jail from the Midlands. “We understand 15 prisoners were transferred to Hull and one of those prisoners, thought to be involved in inciting the riots along with others at Birmingham, assaulted a senior officer yesterday,” Rolfe told the Guardian.

The Prison Officers’ Association claimed that inmates at HMP Hull were under lockdown, with only a few allowed out of their cells at a time. The union said CCTV cameras were set on fire and that some inmates had refused to return to their cells after the arrival of the 15 men.

Rob Nicholson, chairman of the Hull branch of the Prison Officers’ Association, told the Hull Daily Mail: “It is a powder keg and it’s waiting to go off. They are trying to incite riots and we’ve had a really bad couple of days here. I’ve spoken to very experienced prison officers this morning and they tell me they fear for their safety.”

Nicholson added: “They were put in one unit, which beggars belief. We wouldn’t have expected the majority of people who have come from a disturbance to be put in the one room, but that was the decision that was taken.

“For me and my members, it was a ludicrous decision. They set fire to the cameras just after they got here and a senior officer was assaulted by, we believe, one of the main instigators of what happened in Birmingham.”



A Ministry of Justice source disputed claims that the prison was on lockdown. He said one prisoner had tried to damage a CCTV camera, but denied that several had been set alight. “A few prisoners were unhappy about being moved and there was a minor altercation, but this was dealt with well by the staff,” the source said.

A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: “HMP Hull, like all prisons across the estate, is being closely monitored for signs of potential unrest. That includes managing the transfer of prisoners in the interests of maintaining safe, calm and normal regimes. We have specially trained prison staff available to respond to any disturbances.” 



The disturbance at Hull follows the 12-hour riots at HMP Birmingham on Friday, described as the worst prison riot since Strangeways 25 years ago.



Karl Turner, the Labour MP for Hull East, said: “I have it on good authority that Hull prison is on the brink of a riot. And clearly, this chaos has been caused by the government, no one else. Since 2010, they’ve slashed the numbers of prison officers by 7,000 and, clearly, the prison system cannot cope. They’re replaced highly experienced prison officers with people who are inexperienced in order to save cash.

“This chaos has been caused by the government and Liz Truss needs to do more to resolve the issue. They need to put money into the prison system urgently and they need to recruit … It’s not good enough for the coalition to sack 7,000 experienced officers and then announce the recruitment of 2,500 between now and 2020. This chaos is entirely made by the government. It’s the government policy – cut now and think later – that’s failed prison officers and prisons.”

Chibundu Onuzo seems to think that it was appropriate for a nurse to ask patients, on their way to surgery, if she could pray with them (I’m invisible – I am a Christian, 13 December). I put the question to my elderly friends. The majority said that it would terrify them at a particularly vulnerable time as they would assume that the nurse expected them to die. Some said they would be angry at such an inappropriate question in a hospital. One commented that he had previously been approached by a hospital chaplain and, far from being comforted, was shocked that the NHS was paying the chaplain’s wages when it had had cut nursing staff.

To inflict your own beliefs on someone who cannot get away from you and at such a tense time is unprofessional in the extreme. Everyone is entitled to practise their own belief in their private life, but forcing it on others in the work environment is simply wrong.

• The Darent Valley hospital board will waste a lot of NHS money on lawyers’ fees by sacking a good nurse, Sarah Kuteh, in a cruel manner. All she did was to ask patients if they would like prayer support. She was not thrusting her Christian views on them. Perhaps the hospital chaplain team could act as advocates between the board and Sarah before this escalates into an unnecessary expensive and wasteful court case. How about doing this before Christmas?

Eddie James

Rillington, North Yorkshire

• It is sad that Sarah Kuteh lost her job after offering to pray with patients. Generally I feel that, as with politics, religion should be avoided in the workplace. Someone is going to be offended or feel excluded, so best not. If hospital admission forms still list religion, patients could then be informed what services are available, hospital chaplain etc.

Going into surgery affects people in different ways – pre-meds make me sleepy and I prefer to be left alone – but if someone needs prayer before then, best to discuss that at time of admission.

Val Cook

Radcliffe-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire

• Chibundu Onuzo complains of invisibility. How strange! For consider. There is a church in every village and district – often several. There are bishops in the House of Lords. There are church schools round every corner – with more to come. There are prayers in parliament and council meetings. There is the priority that schools give to religious perspectives on morals and belief; perspectives to which most of us are now indifferent or hostile. And then there is Thought for the Day – still closed to non-religious voices.

It’s an odd kind of invisibility that is quite so visible. And an odd kind of believer who feels that it’s not enough.

Charles Dickens was outraged by child labour and for good reason: he had first hand experience of working long hours for little pay in bad conditions.

By the time Dickens came to chronicle his childhood experiences during the 1820s in David Copperfield, the first steps had been taken to end the exploitation of children by unscrupulous employers. There was a parliamentary inquiry in 1832 followed by legislation the following year so that a child working in a textile mill could work no more than an eight-hour day.

That was almost two centuries ago, yet in parts of the world child labour is still rife. There has been much discussion during 2016 about the effects of globalisation, almost all of it focused on problems it has caused for those struggling in developed countries.

But globalisation is a two-way street. At one end there’s the factory worker thrown on the scrapheap because it is cheaper to outsource production to a low-wage country. At the other there are workers making the trainers and the T-shirts. And many of them are children who should be playing with toys rather than making them. In the west, a company would never survive the public opprobrium following revelations that children as young as 10 were working 45-hour weeks.

Multinational corporations know that consumers are not especially keen on child exploitation in developing countries either, so many of them have signed codes of practice designed to ensure that children are not going through the sort of experiences suffered by Dickens in the 1820s.

That, though, is the reality according to a new report that looks at the link between child labour and education in the slums of one city – Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh. The findings are worrying.

Bangladesh has a good record on human development. Poverty levels have fallen and it is close to getting every child in primary school. It has taken steps to achieve gender equity. Put simply, plenty of countries could learn some lessons from Bangladesh.



But the report written by Maria Quattri and Kevin Watkins for the UK thinktank, the Overseas Development Institute, found that child labour was rife in the slums, in part because families were desperate for the extra income their children were bringing in and in part because the poor quality of education meant dropout rates were high.



Dhaka is one of the world’s fastest growing mega cities. Migration from rural areas to the cities has been a big part of Bangladesh’s economic development, but urbanisation has been accompanied by rapid growth in slums.



The ODI study looked at slums in eight of Dhaka’s administrative units drawing on a large sample of 2,700 households in which children as well as adults took part.

It found a high incidence of children working from the ages of six to 14, with an average rate of 15% from across the eight survey sites. Another 15% were neither in school nor working. The overwhelming majority of working children were out of the school.

There are globally agreed rules drawn up by a UN body, the International Labour Organisation, governing the employment of children, and these make a distinction between child work and child labour.

Convention 138 allows children from the age of 13 (12 in the poorest countries) to do light work provided it doesn’t affect their attendance at school. Light work means work that is not hazardous – such as working down a mine, on a construction site or operating a machine in a factory – up to a maximum of 14 hours a week.

Writing in the Observer, a group of academics voiced opposition to calls from the UN for tougher action to stop children working, saying that the focus should instead be to avoid dangerous occupations and exploitation.

But the ODI study revealed that almost all the working children in the Dhaka slums were involved in what the ILO would classify as child labour, with hazardous work featuring prominently. Almost all were working more than 42 hours a week, with child labour levels rising steadily from 8% at the age of 10 to 45% by 14. Two-thirds of girl child labourers were employed making clothes, a big export earner for Bangladesh, which has an estimated 7,000 garment factories, employing about 5 million workers. 



Some of these are direct suppliers for foreign brands. They tend to be the bigger operations, but they sub-contract work to a large – less well policed – informal sector. 



“We do not state outright that named foreign brands can be linked to factories employing child labour,” the ODI report says. “However, it stretches credibility to assume that the supply chains for these brands do not include significant employment of child labourers.

“First, with over 60% of working girls and 13% of working boys reporting employment in the garment sector, this is the single largest source of employment in our sample. Second, the operations of direct and indirect exporters, and formal and informal suppliers, are deeply integrated. Widespread sub-contracting renders it highly probable that children are producing clothing destined for international supply chains.”

Children are driven into work by necessity. Poor families send their sons and daughters out to work to make ends meet: the survey found that the wages earned by children equalise the average incomes of households with and without working children.

The ODI report found that children are entering the labour market having had on average four years of schooling, typically of a poor quality. Basic literacy and numeracy skills are low, meaning that the children who drop out of school are on course for a life in lowly-paid jobs.

There are obvious ways of tackling child labour in Dhaka’s slums. The government could provide more effective enforcement to ensure compulsory primary education. It could raise its spending on education from 3% of national output, a level well below that in sub-Saharan Africa. It could raise the school leaving age. It could introduce a system of cash transfers that would compensate households for the foregone wages of their children, which average $47 a month for those aged six to 14.

One thing is certain: Bangladesh will pay a price if it fails to crack down on child labour. It is recognised that having a well-educated workforce is vital for economic development, which is why the UN has made universal secondary education one of its sustainable development goals to be achieved by 2030. This won’t happen in Bangladesh (and plenty of other countries) without a stronger commitment to eradicating child labour, which in turn means free, compulsory education for those aged six to 14.

It might also be time for western companies, governments and consumers to ask themselves a simple question: if child labour was wrong in the London of the 1820s, what makes it right in the Dhaka of the 2010s?

Thousands of people are being made homeless every year because they cannot find lawyers to help them resist eviction, charities are warning.

Even though legal aid is available to help anyone in danger of losing their home, there has been an 18% decline in the number of challenges brought, at a time of record repossessions in the private rental market.

The latest figures, highlighted by the Legal Action Group (LAG) and the homeless charity Shelter, reinforce warnings by the Law Society that “advice deserts”, where few, if any, lawyers are left in practice who are capable of dealing with legal aid housing cases, are emerging across England and Wales.

Last year, 42,728 households in rented accommodation were forcibly removed, according to Ministry of Justice figures. That number has risen by 53% since 2010 and now stands at an all-time high.

Deep cuts to other forms of housing legal aid introduced by the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders (LASPO) Act 2012, bureaucratic obstructions and poor hourly rates have progressively driven most lawyers specialising in housing out of the market, leaving few practitioners.

“People on low incomes facing homelessness and eviction are struggling to get the local face-to-face advice they desperately need and are entitled to by law,” the LAG’s latest report says. The 18% decrease, recorded in official MoJ figures, is in the three months of April to June this year compared with the same quarter the previous year.

There are some areas of the country, such as Suffolk and Shropshire, where there is no housing legal aid expert operating at all, the LAG points out. “Too often, lack of any early intervention funding not only ties [lawyers’] hands, but makes it impossible to either identify clients for whom a ‘stitch in time’ might work, or deliver the outcomes that can help to avoid litigation.”

One housing solicitor said: “It’s impossible to separate the cuts to legal aid from the cuts to the benefits system. The bedroom tax and Atos disability reassessments all feed into problems we deal with, such as homelessness. Because we can’t do benefits work any more, it’s harder for us to nip problems in the bud. We’re forced to take action at a much later stage, which will ultimately cost the government a lot more.”

Steve Hynes, the LAG’s director, told the Guardian: “Due to civil legal aid and other spending cuts, people with common civil legal problems such as difficulties paying the rent or claiming benefits have nowhere to turn.

“The reduction in civil legal aid services has gone beyond what the government originally intended. Civil legal aid services are in freefall, with solicitor firms and advice agencies closing.

“The government need to use the recently announced review of the LASPO Act to rethink providing early advice in cases, as too often help is only given when costly court-based solutions are the only option.”

The number of all legal aid advice cases has dropped by 75% following the LASPO cuts in April 2013 and is continuing to fall.

John Gallagher, principal solicitor at the homelessness charity Shelter, said: “We have housing officers in 17 locations across the country and some of them are the only source of legal assistance in their areas.

“In many areas there are only two or three providers of legal help. Some problems are, at root, to do with benefits but we can only claim for work on repossessions.”

Gallagher said there was a large amount of “unmet need” with claimants who are technically “in scope” – entitled to receive legal aid – but who cannot find specialist lawyers to help them with their cases. Thousands of people in such a situation are probably losing their homes every year, he said.

Lawyers who work on housing legal aid cases are paid at the rate of £57 an hour, rising to £63 if they appear in court. “That may not initially sound a bad return,” Gallagher explained. “But it has not gone up for 15 or 20 years and lawyers have to pay all their overheads. It’s just not viable in some places.”

The Legal Aid Agency has made the process of obtaining funding increasingly complex and difficult, Gallagher added. “There are people who because of want of legal representation lose their homes because they don’t know what to say in court.”

The Law Society, which represents solicitors across England and Wales, has campaigned to raise awareness of the advice deserts. Earlier this summer Catherine Dixon, the organisation’s chief executive, warned: “Advice on housing is vital for people who are facing eviction, the homeless and those renting a property in serious disrepair. Early legal advice on housing matters can make the difference between a family being made homeless or not.

“People who require legal aid advice for housing issues often need it urgently,” she said. “Families are unable to access justice because they cannot afford to travel to see the one provider in their area who may be located long distances from where they live.”

A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: “We have a world-leading legal system, and last year spent more than £1.5bn on legal aid.

“We must ensure legal aid is sustainable and fair - both for those who need it and the taxpayer who pays for it. That is why we have made sure support remains available to the most vulnerable and in the most serious cases.



“We have committed to carrying out a post-implementation review of the civil legal aid changes and an announcement on this will be made in due course.”

A group of international academics has condemned a United Nations convention which bans child labour as “harmful and unnecessary”, arguing that allowing young children to work can have positive effects which are not being taken into account.

In a controversial letter to the Observer, the researchers, who all work in the fields of child development or human rights, say the UN committee on the rights of the child has ignored available evidence in favour of outdated and ill-informed western prejudices and policies which can have a negative impact on the ground.

Across the globe, 193 countries have committed to ending child labour by 2025 under the UN’s sustainable development goals. But the academics want the existing minimum age (15 in some countries, 18 in others), to be abandoned, arguing that “age-appropriate” work can be beneficial for children in both the developing and the developed worlds and gives poor children a chance to improve their lives.

One of the signatories, Dr Dorte Thorsen of the school of global studies at the University of Sussex, said: “Banning children from work doesn’t bring them back into school; in fact, it might do the opposite if they were working to pay their school fees.

“For some children it’s a matter of rational economics. We have years of evidence that show that work doesn’t end a childhood and often can enhance it, can create a solidarity. In some countries in Africa, and in India, we are seeing collectivisation movements of child workers, a unionisation where they are trying to participate in politics, be heard, as opposed to this being a story of victimisation and oppression.”

Thorsen criticised the Department for International Development minister Priti Patel for pressuring British companies to scrutinise their supply chains for evidence of child labour, a task Thorsen says they are unlikely to have the competence to perform properly.

The experts also pointed to the setting up of schools in some countries for employees, which had then closed after pressure from the international campaign against child labour. Other children, they said, have been forced into hazardous, dangerous or illegal work because more regulated employment became closed to them.

Richard Carothers, a Toronto-based child development expert at the International Child Protection Network, said: “The hard-headed attitude of the big bureaucratic international agencies, immediately putting kids out of work because they think they should be playing football instead, is definitely not the way to approach this. Children need to be protected from nasty situations, and there is a debate about whether the percentage of working children in nasty situations is a small percentage or a very small percentage, but in no way does fixating on an age limit help kids in situations where they are being harmed.”

He said that UN officials should listen to children’s views. “How do they want things changed for them? How do we change things for working children? We need to be developing far more nuanced policy, more sophisticated understanding. Once a country ratifies a UN convention, then this translates into national law, and that’s it. Too simplistic. It’s damaging. We have case study after case study where children and their families have been damaged.”

Mélanie Jacquemin, a sociologist from the University of Marseille, is now in the Côte d’Ivoire, researching stories of children and adults who have migrated from village to city as children to find work. She said the stereotypes of exploited children were the exception.

“Yes, some child workers are in harsh situations. They are not matching the standards we have for decent work at all, they can be exploited and sometimes they are overworked. And of course if someone has your passport and you are deprived of your liberty and in a slavery situation, then this is a very important issue – trafficking does exist.

“But all the studies have shown that, although important morally, these cases are very much a minority issue compared with the great majority of children who are working under decent conditions, particularly here in west Africa.”

Young workers need help to avoid pitfalls, she said, and children, whether in Africa or Europe, will sometimes go and expose themselves to risk and be exploited. But banning work represented a grave error by big international agencies, she said, and was a decision based on “extremes of experiences that don’t cover the experiences of real people living and learning”.

The UN committee on the rights of the child did not respond to requests for comment.

When Seeta Kaur arrived in India with her children for a three-week visit to her husband’s relatives she was determined that when she returned to Britain it would be with both the sons who had accompanied her.

Since giving birth to the boys, who were aged 10 and two when they travelled to India, Seeta had confided in her family and close friends about the domestic abuse she suffered at the hands of her husband, Pawan, for resisting his demands to give one of them away.

Pawan, an Indian national, lived with Seeta and their four children (they also had two daughters) in Edmonton, north London, where she was born and raised. He wanted his brother and sister-in-law in India to have one of their sons because they could not have children of their own and, at the end of the trip, threatened to leave one of them behind.

Informal inter-family adoptions are not uncommon in India, because of an inefficient and disorganised legal adoption system. According to the government’s own figures, 3,000 children were adopted formally in the country last year, while there are an estimated 30 million orphans in the country.

Swinder Singh, Seeta’s sister, said: “She was open with us about the volatile relationship with her husband and the huge pressure she was under to give one of her sons away, which he had made a matter of family honour. She was a British woman and the idea horrified her.”

On 31 March last year, Pawan phoned Seeta’s family in north London to tell them she had died of a heart attack at her in-laws’ home in Kurukshetra in the north Indian state of Haryana.

They flew to India and began to suspect she was the victim of an “honour” killing when they saw bruising around Seeta’s neck and upper chest as she lay in her coffin. They announced their plan to take her back to Britain the following morning for a postmortem … but awoke to discover that Seeta had been cremated while they slept. When the case was closed by Indian police without a full investigation, Seeta’s family turned to the Metropolitan police for help, but say they were initially told that British officers had no jurisdiction to investigate because the alleged crime took place abroad.

The Foreign and Commonwealth Office said it could not get involved, or help secure the return of Seeta’s four children, who remain in India with their father, despite the high court ordering their return in April last year.

The family’s fight is now being led by the women’s group Southall Black Sisters, who have amassed a dossier of evidence and launched a “Justice for Seeta” campaign. They are backed by Kate Osamor, the family’s local MP, and Naz Shah, who has led the fight for justice for Samia Shahid, the Bradford woman killed in Pakistan last July.

They are calling for the Metropolitan police to look into Seeta’s case, and demanding new legislation that would make it easier to investigate “honour” killings of British citizens abroad, claiming a legal grey area is letting perpetrators evade justice. Pragna Patel, director of Southall Black Sisters, said: “Men are taking women abroad and getting away with honour crimes because the law is not clear on what exactly is the duty of British authorities to investigate them.”

Describing the current situation as a “lottery”, she cited cases such as that of Madeleine McCann and missing toddler Ben Needham as proof that British police are willing to investigate crimes abroad in some instances. “Clearly, when there are non-white Britons involved and it’s an ‘honour’ crime, then there appears to be a dereliction of duty on the part of the British police. This is what has happened in Seeta’s case, because we have collected concrete evidence and yet the Metropolitan police have not acted upon it.”

This evidence includes 26 witness statements from friends and relatives with details of the abuse they say she suffered for opposing her husband. One of her closest friends testified that, ahead of the trip to India, Seeta confided to her that she feared for her life. It was also said that the couple had a heated argument on the night she died. Medical reports showed that Seeta, aged 33, had no condition to explain a heart attack.

Shamik Dutta, solicitor for Seeta’s family, said: “A new law which recognises the international nature of honour killing would help families secure justice and act as a deterrent against such offences.”

The dossier compiled by campaigners was sent to the Metropolitan police in August, but no response has yet been received. The police said in a statement: “We are in the process of responding to a number of queries raised with us by a firm of solicitors acting on behalf of the family of Seeta.”

About 240 inmates involved in a 12-hour riot at one of Britain’s biggest prisons are being moved out of the jail, the Ministry of Justice has said.

The disorder involved as many as 600 of HMP Birmingham’s 1,450 inmates and spread across four of the 11 wings of the G4S-run jail, formerly known as Winson Green, on Friday.

Specially trained prison guards, known as Tornado squads, were backed up by about 25 riot police officers as they moved into the Victorian facility. Order was not restored until late on Friday night.

One prisoner is understood to have sustained a broken jaw during the disturbances but no prison officers were injured.

A Ministry of Justice spokeswoman said the prison remained “calm and ordered” on Saturday and additional staff were on site.

“The Prison Service will continue to work closely with G4S to manage the prison safely over the coming days. A full assessment of the damage is under way. Initial reports indicate that two wings suffered superficial damage, with more serious damage to a further two wings,” she said.

“A limited regime is being offered to those who were not involved in the disturbance and staff continue to work closely with West Midlands police. A thorough investigation into the disturbance is under way.”

The MoJ did not say where the prisoners were being transferred the day after the disturbance, which was the third in a prison in England in less than two months.

Mike Rolfe, the national chairman of the Prison Officers Association, said more than 30 staff had left the jail in recent weeks.

“This prison is a tough place to work, it serves a very big area, it serves a large, dangerous population of prisoners, but it’s not unlike many other prisons up and down the country – ones that have very similar inmates,” he told the BBC.

“We’ve been warning for a long time about the crisis in prisons, and what we are seeing at Birmingham is not unique to Birmingham, but it certainly would seem that this is the most recent worst incident since the 1990 Strangeways riot.”

The head of the National Offender Management Service Agency, Michael Spurr, said gang-related violence and violence fuelled by psychoactive drugs had “really changed the dynamic” in UK prisons.

“Where we are at this moment with our prisons is not where I or anybody, I think, in society would want to be, but I’m confident that we can change that. We now are getting resources for the first time in a number of years that will enable us to do it,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.

“It will not be done overnight. There are serious problems that will require determined, consistent leadership from governors and staff across the service to put right, but they are incredibly professional, skilled professionals, and with this resource, over the coming months and years, we will turn it around.”

The justice secretary, Liz Truss, said the situation, in which keys giving access to residential prison areas were taken from an officer and inmates occupied some blocks and exercise facilities,would be investigated thoroughly. 



“Violence in our prisons will not be tolerated and those responsible will face the full force of the law,” she said.

Jerry Petherick, a G4S executive, said the prisoners behind the trouble displayed a callous disregard for the safety of other inmates and staff. “This disturbance will rightly be subject to scrutiny and we will work openly and transparently with the Ministry of Justice and other relevant authorities to understand the cause of [Friday’s] disorder.”

The shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, told Channel 4 News that “private companies should not be involved in taking away people’s liberty. Actually, it’s clear that G4S don’t have the quality of staff to manage a crisis like this.”

Robert Neill, the Conservative chairman of the Commons justice committee, told the programme that the MPs on his committee had warned the government that a “time bomb was ticking” because prisons were in crisis.

Asked if this had been the worst prison riot in years, Neill replied: “This is a problem which has happened both in privately and publicly run systems, so it applies across the piece. I think that does indicate that we have got a situation where, if people are locked down 22, 23 hours a day, as we have discovered, that breeds tension, that breeds violence, and, as you rightly say, we are not actually keeping prisons secure enough to stop contraband getting in.”

HMP Birmingham was the first UK prison to be handed over to the private sector in October 2011. G4S began running the jail with 98 fewer staff than when it was under government control.

Although the 596 former government employees who were transferred to G4S kept the same salaries, new recruits were paid less than the average £28,000 they earned – and on different terms and conditions – the Financial Times reported at the time.

An advertisement on the G4S website states that the company has 25 openings for the full-time role of prison custody officer in Birmingham for which “no specific previous qualifications or experience are required”.

The job pays £20,228.16 a year for 39 hours a week, the equivalent of just under £10 an hour, as well as “company pension, generous holiday entitlement, training and development”.

The Irish government is failing to protect victims of human trafficking, according to the country’s human rights watchdog.

In a report submitted to the Council of Europe, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC) said there is a “deficit” in the protection of victims of trafficking and called on the Irish government to act immediately to ensure victims are properly identified and protected.

“Victims of human trafficking in Ireland are not getting the kinds of supports they should be getting,” said Emily Logan, the organisation’s chief commissioner.

Logan met with members of the Council of Europe’s Group of Experts on Action Against Trafficking in Human Beings (Greta), who visited Ireland last week. They are examining how the Irish state deals with human trafficking and how victims are supported and protected. Their second evaluation report is due to be published in 2017, four years after the group’s initial report highlighted numerous gaps in the protections given to victims of trafficking in Ireland.

Colin Smith, a leading Irish human rights barrister who specialises in trafficking law, said IHREC’s report highlights the “unhappy fact” that Ireland lacks a coherent anti-trafficking system capable of effectively prosecuting and punishing traffickers while also protecting their victims.

“It underlines, in particular, the urgent need for a statutory mechanism to identify victims of trafficking,” said Smith. “Every day that passes without substantive reform means that traffickers are going unpunished and victims are going unprotected. We need to move away from thinking of trafficking as an immigration problem and towards a system that is quick and fair, and that treats human trafficking as a serious human rights issue.”

Logan highlighted the case of a 54-year-old Vietnamese woman known as “Ms P”, who was charged with drug offences after being arrested by Irish police during a raid on a cannabis grow house in 2012. Ms P said she was trafficked, but the police did not recognise her as a victim and she was detained for nearly three years. Last year her case against the police was heard in the High Court and the judge ruled that the scheme for identifying and protecting trafficked victims in Ireland was inadequate under EU law.

“The identification process has not improved for victims of trafficking in Ireland,” said Logan.

The report said reform of Ireland’s system for the early identification of trafficking victims was “long overdue”. Logan urged the Irish government to legislate immediately for the identification and protection of victims of trafficking.

“We are saying it should be included as a piece of legislation which obliges the state to comply,” she said. “The likelihood is that the victims will get a better response.”

Sole competence for the identification of potential victims of trafficking is with the Irish police, which the report said “does not represent good practice”. There is concern that, without reform, unidentified victims will experience further human rights violations.

Earlier this year, the US State Department’s annual report (pdf) on Trafficking in Persons (TiP) said victims of forced labour had been identified in the Irish restaurant industry and in car washes. Moreover, for the first time, a non-EU person was identified as a victim of trafficking in the Irish fishing sector.

The IHREC report raised concerns that no prosecutions have taken place in relation to human trafficking for labour exploitation, even though eight potential victims were reported in 2014. The commission said labour inspections must be properly resourced and targeted at high risk sectors such as domestic and restaurant work, the maritime industry, car-washing services and agriculture. The report called on the Irish government to criminalise the use of services that are the object of labour exploitation.

Logan said she had been approached by people in the Irish agri-food sector who have alleged exploitation. Early next year, an IHREC advisory committee involving various trade unions will be set up to focus on labour issues.

Irish human rights groups and NGOs have previously expressed concern about how potential trafficked victims are treated. The Immigrant Council of Ireland’s anti-trafficking manager, Nusha Yonkova, welcomed the report and expressed support for its recommendations.

“Ireland is failing victims of human trafficking,” she said. “The IHREC submission makes it clear that little progress has been made since the first Greta visit in 2012.”

In a statement, Ireland’s Department of Justice said they had not yet had the opportunity to consider the report’s recommendations in full. The department added that they had consulted with IHREC and included their recommendations in the second national plan to prevent human trafficking, which was published in October.

The overwhelming majority of people arrested for alleged terrorism offences over the past 15 years have been freed without charge or conviction, official figures show.

Fewer than two in 10 people detained by police since September 2001 were convicted directly of terrorism or a terrorism-related offence.

The figures released by the Home Office showed that 3,349 people in England and Wales were arrested under terrorism laws since the 9/11 attacks on the US.



Of those arrested for terrorism and related offences, 17.8% were convicted in relation to involvement in violent jihad, for instance plotting attacks, funding or facilitating.

Another 10% arrested on suspicion of terrorism were convicted of offences unrelated to the terrorism charges they were originally arrested for, taking the total to 27.6%.

The majority of those arrested were from British Muslim communities.

The figures sparked debate about why most of those arrested on suspicion of involvement in terrorism end up not being charged or convicted of any criminal offence.



Lord Paddick, the Lib Dem spokesman on home affairs in the House of Lords, and a former deputy assistant commissioner at Scotland Yard, said: “The police need to account for these figures. It is extremely worrying that there is such a high attrition rate between those arrested and those convicted of terrorism offences.



“The most important thing with terrorism is community intelligence and building trust and confidence with those communities from where terrorists come. This sort of statistic will tend to undermine that trust and confidence.”

A spokesman for the National Police Chiefs’ Council said: “No one is arrested without sufficient grounds for suspicion but the legal bar for offences is rightly set very high, meaning many will not go on to be charged or convicted.

“These powers are applied appropriately and proportionately to keep the public safe and we do not target a specific community. We take all forms of terrorism and extremism seriously – including from the extreme right wing – and will work hard with all communities to tackle it.”

In Britain’s counter-terrorism system, intelligence is developed by the security service MI5, and then passed to police to take enforcement action and build a case that can convict someone to the criminal standard of beyond a reasonable doubt.

David Videcette, who served as a detective with Scotland Yard’s counter-terrorism command for a decade, said: “A lot of the information comes from the security services. A lot of what they give cannot be used as evidence; it is difficult to convert the intelligence into something that can be used in the criminal justice system.

“No one would thank the police if, because the intelligence cannot be converted, they did nothing.”

The Home Office said decisions to arrest were a matter for the police and decisions to prosecute a matter for the Crown Prosecution Service.

The latest terrorism figures showed arrests were down from their peak a year ago. Counter-terrorism officials say they are working flat out to thwart plots to attack the UK.

In 2001, the biggest threat was from al-Qaida, which was inspired by Osama bin Laden. Since 2014 the Islamic State ideology has been linked to most terror threats on British soil.

The security minister, Ben Wallace, said: “We are determined to detect, disrupt and where possible prosecute all those who pose a threat to the UK. The figures released today once again highlight the hard work carried out by the police, security service and Crown Prosecution Service day in and day out to keep the people of this country safe.”

Chris Grayling is a name that strikes terror into the heart of anyone who cares how well the country is run. Legal aid reform, books to prisoners, and possibly even the catastrophic state of Southern’s industrial relations, which this week left hundreds of thousands of commuters unable to get to work because of a two-day strike – his fingerprints are on them all. Only last week, an email emerged showing Mr Grayling blocking a suggestion from the then mayor of London, Boris Johnson, who wanted to take control of suburban rail services, on the grounds that it would be disastrous if a future Labour mayor had such power. This is a man whose every decision is coloured by ideological advantage, a man in too much of a hurry – as a video that emerged on Thursday showed – even to look behind him for cyclists before opening his car door. This morning, with the publication of the chief inspector of probation’s report on the work of north London’s community rehabilitation company (CRC), another policy executed in politically motivated haste staggered back to roost.

When Mr Grayling became justice secretary in 2012 the probation service was widely considered to be failing. Few questioned the need for reform, although Mr Grayling’s solution of privatising the part of the service that dealt with less serious offenders was not an obvious one. But his department had been heavily cut; he wanted to reform the service without it costing more. He argued that privatisation would release enough new money to extend the support that a good probation service offers to offenders serving short prison terms and community sentences. It was a bold objective – and perhaps the most ambitious privatisation ever attempted – but providing improved rehabilitation and better support in order to reduce reoffending had plenty of advocates. It was the method that alarmed them.

In the words of MPs on the justice committee that examined the proposal, “witnesses … had significant apprehensions about the scale, architecture, detail and consequences of the reforms … and the pace at which the government is seeking to implement them”. They warned that not enough preliminary work had been done and little of it had been tested. They could see a disaster coming down the tracks. Now it is clear that it has arrived.

Dame Glenys Stacey, the chief inspector of probation, found that the services offered in north London by the CRC had failed to reduce the numbers reoffending while losing others altogether. She found caseloads too big to be managed, inexperienced officers – there is no obligation to use professionally qualified staff – “extremely poor” oversight and a lack of senior management focus and control. It was failing, she said, even to do the absolute basics. A week ago, a Guardian community appeal to readers asking for their experience of the privatised service drew 300 responses, many of them describing huge workloads, inexperienced colleagues and the stress of being unable to do the job properly.

Not all of the five inspections of the new CRCs have been critical, but most of them have. There was enough evidence for the current justice secretary, Liz Truss, to announce an internal review last week. She says she is open to radical reform if that is what its report, due in April, recommends. Even that may be complicated by the contracts. They were meant to draw in the scores of local charities that traditionally work with prisoners; instead most of the £3.7bn work went to large foreign-owned companies which now complain that they are unsustainable and the IT system, bequeathed by the Ministry of Justice, inadequate.

The probation service has been seriously damaged. It was an outcome widely predicted – even, as the MPs said, by people who thought it was a good idea. It was the act of a partisan minister who cared more about getting his reforms signed off before the election than he did for the consequences – of which he was warned, again and again.

Sharia courts are a symptom rather than the cause of the problems many Muslim women face (Sharia courts have no place in UK family law, theguardian.com, 14 December). The real problem is that most mosques do not register themselves under the Marriage Act 1949 and imams are willing to perform marriage ceremonies without insisting on the marriage being registered. Muslim wives in particular are usually not aware that their “marriage” has no legal status until the relationship breaks down, and they discover that they are merely cohabitants with few rights and in that circumstance going to a sharia “court” may be the best option they have.

It is a criminal offence to solemnise a marriage that is not registered under the Marriage Act. If the government started enforcing that provision and ensured that all Muslim marriages are properly registered, that would achieve far more for Muslim women than yet another review of sharia courts.

• I never thought I’d agree with Norman Tebbit about anything, but his comments about sharia law – as mocked in (Pass notes, G2, 14 December) – are broadly accurate. As the work of One Law for All, the pressure group campaigning against the spread of sharia law, makes clear, sharia councils and courts act as quasi-judicial authorities, and although they have no status under civil law, many Muslims regard their decisions as binding. These decisions in the field of family law are highly discriminatory against women, and children are also at risk because decisions about residence and contact are made without reference to the Children Act. Crimes under the secular law of the state, such as marital rape, domestic abuse and polygamy, are accepted or even actively promoted. Would that all this were just a “popular myth”.

Lawyers must display their prices more prominently so customers know what they will pay, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has recommended in a highly critical report on legal services in the UK. 



Fewer than 17% of solicitors’ firms and other legal providers publish a price list online, the report notes, leaving many clients in the dark about the costs they are likely to incur for even straightforward requests like making wills or dealing with court cases. 



The study concludes: “The legal services sector is not working well for individual consumers and small businesses. [They] generally lack the experience and information needed to find their way around the legal services sector and to engage confidently with providers. 



“Consumers find it hard to make informed choices because there is very little transparency about price, service and quality. This lack of transparency weakens competition between providers and means that some consumers do not obtain legal advice when they would benefit from it. Increasing transparency of price, service and quality is therefore essential for consumers to get a better deal.

“Regulators [should] develop new minimum standards for disclosures of price, service, redress and regulatory status, and require providers to adhere to them.”

Lawyers have traditionally charged by the hour, although such practices are gradually being replaced by fixed pricing deals. “While not all services may be amenable to a fixed price,” the CMA report says, “our analysis indicates that much more could be done to aid comparability.”

The price of a standard simple will ranges from around £110 to £200, the report notes; the price for a complex divorce with a dispute over assets may vary from around £1,260 to £3,000.

The CMA suggests developing comparison websites to allow customers to assess providers. It also recommends that the Ministry of Justice investigate whether to extend protection from existing redress schemes to customers using unauthorised providers.

Coinciding with the report, one price comparison website, the Law Superstore, claimed that British clients may have overpaid lawyers by nearly £500m in the last year, based on the wide price differentials for some basic legal services.

Rachel Merelie, acting executive director for markets and mergers at the CMA, said: “You might not need a lawyer very often but when you do it will often be at a crucial point in your life – whether that’s buying a property, resolving a dispute or getting expert advice on financial and employment matters. So the transparency, affordability and accessibility shortcomings we have identified are a real concern.”

Around £11-12bn a year is spent by consumers on legal services in England and Wales in areas that include commercial law, employment law, family law, conveyancing, wills and probate.

The Law Society, which represents solicitors in England and Wales, said a desire for greater competition and deregulation in the legal services sector should not be allowed to undermine consumer protection.

Its president, Robert Bourns, said: “The CMA’s decision not to conduct a market investigation into the legal sector is welcomed. However, it is astonishing that some of the CMA’s recommendations prioritise deregulation over consumer protection.

“If solicitors were to offer legal services from unregulated companies as suggested by the CMA, then their clients would no longer enjoy a raft of protections – from confidentiality to compensation – offered by every solicitor in a solicitor firm. These deregulatory changes would undermine consumer protections and erode trust in the legal system.”

Paul Philip, chief executive of the Solicitors Regulation Authority, said: “We welcome the final CMA report on its review of the legal market. I am pleased that the CMA has strongly endorsed our reform proposals , which will help to tackle unmet need and support members of the public and small businesses to access legal services.”

More than 20 MPs from seven parties in the UK parliament have urged the British foreign secretary to echo US government calls for the release of the Bahraini human rights activist Nabeel Rajab.

Bahrain’s criminal court on Thursday postponed his trial to 28 December, when he is expected to be sentenced.

Rajab, who faces up to 15 years in jail for comments made on Twitter criticising the war in Yemen, has been held in pre-trial detention since June. He is also accused of “defaming the state” by publishing “false news .. and malicious rumours that undermine the prestige of the kingdom” in an opinion piece in the New York Times.

He was arrested on separate charges of “spreading false information and rumours with the aim of discrediting the state”.

In September, the US State Department spokesman Mark Toner said the government called for the immediate release of Rajab, but the UK has thus far refused to do likewise.

Amnesty International has called the charges a “barefaced assault on freedom of expression”. Human Rights Watch’s executive director, Ken Roth, named Rajab as one of two human rights activists currently imprisoned whom he thought most resembled “the next Nelson Mandela”.

In a letter to Boris Johnson ahead of the trial, which had been due to be held on Thursday, MPs from the Conservatives, Labour, the Scottish National party, the Democratic Unionist party, the Liberal Democrats, the Greens and the SDLP asked the Foreign Office to express its concern.

“We urge you [...] to make it clear to Bahraini officials that the United Kingdom wishes to see his unconditional release from prison, and for the charges brought against him, which are related to his right to freedom of expression and freedom of speech, to be dropped,” it reads.



MPs who have signed the letter include Labour’s Andy Slaughter and Ann Clywd, the Lib Dems’ Tom Brake and Alastair Carmichael, the Greens’ Caroline Lucas and the Conservatives’ Tania Mathias.

During Theresa May’s visit to Bahrain last week, her spokeswoman would not say if any specific cases had been raised in bilaterals, but said the UK did raise human rights cases as part of a wider engagement on Gulf reforms.

Rights campaigners in Bahrain have argued that, although the UK has been engaging closely with Bahraini authorities on judicial and police reform since 2012, its engagement has not prevented crackdowns on journalists and pro-democracy activists in the country.

Since 2011, Rajab has faced multiple prosecutions and prison sentences for his activism. He was banned from travelling in 2014 and has been unable to leave the country. His health is said to have deteriorated since being placed in detention earlier this year.

The SNP’s Margaret Ferrier, the chair of the all-party parliamentary group on democracy and human rights in the Gulf, who coordinated the letter, said: “This is a matter of freedom of speech and expression. Nabeel Rajab is highly regarded as a prominent human rights activist, and these charges are little more than an attempt by Bahraini authorities to silence a dissenting voice.

Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei, the director of advocacy at the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy, said: “We have seen how Theresa May lashed Boris Johnson over his comments on Saudi. Nabeel Rajab criticised Saudi Arabia and Bahrain over their bombardment in Yemen and is facing prison for it.

“If May or her government fail to publicly call for his release, Bahrain will take it as a green light for their repression.”

An inexperienced Sydney journalist and her employer, Yahoo7, face a hefty penalty for publishing a story that resulted in a Melbourne murder jury being discharged.

The Victorian supreme court judge John Dixon last month found reporter Krystal Johnson and Yahoo7 guilty of contempt of court for publishing details about a defendant that could prejudice a jury.

Johnson bypassed subeditors to publish a news story about the trial of Mataio Aleluia on 17 August.

The finding of contempt can be revealed after a guilty verdict was delivered in Aleluia’s retrial on Thursday.

Aleluia was found guilty of murdering mother-of-two Brittany Shanice Harvie, 22, in a violent rage in Clayton South in June 2015 because he thought she had cheated on him.

In delivering his finding in the contempt matter, Dixon said Aleluia was standing trial for the most serious offence known to the law.

“As a matter of fact, the content of the article clearly had a real and definite tendency to prejudice the accused’s trial,” Dixon said.

The Crown prosecutor Kerri Judd QC had described the publication of the article as serious contempt: “What was published was effectively the publication of prior criminal conduct of the same kind alleged in the trial.”

The defence barrister William Houghton QC, in defending the article, had said modern juries should not be equated with “mere peasants”.

He said the trial judge, Justice Lex Lasry, had given a stern and solemn warning to the jury to ignore media coverage.

The contempt trial heard there was a “large spike” in access to the Yahoo7 article the day it was uploaded to the website and it was still receiving hits a day later.

The offending article was accessed about 4,000 times in Victoria, the court heard.

A further hearing in January will consider a penalty and costs for Yahoo7 and Johnson.

The judgment sent a clear message that journalists and publishers need to take special care when publishing material concerning matters that are before a court, the director of public prosecutions, John Champion SC, said in a statement.

The public have been left more at risk by the privatisation of the probation service with some offenders not seen for weeks or months and others lost in the system altogether, according to an official watchdog.

In her most critical report yet, Dame Glenys Stacey, the chief inspector of probation, said that a recent inspection of probation work in the north of London found a simple, unacceptable lack of management attention to whether offenders turned up to appointments and whether their offending behaviour was being challenged.

Her inspection report published on Thursday said probation services in north London have deteriorated since a community rehabilitation company took over the supervision of medium- to low-risk offenders in 2014 and was now poorer than any other area that had been inspected this year.

“A combination of unmanageable caseloads, inexperienced officers, extremely poor oversight and a lack of senior management focus and control meant some offenders were not seen for weeks or months, and some were lost in the system altogether,” concluded the report.

Stacey said: “Delivering probation services in London is never an easy task, but services have deteriorated of late, largely due to the poor performance of the London Community Rehabilitation Company. Services are now well below what people rightly expect, and the city is more at risk as a result.” 



Her highly critical report came after the justice secretary, Elizabeth Truss, acknowledged criticism of the privatised probation companies across England and Wales by demanding the rapid completion of an official review into the performance.



The London CRC, which is owned by MTCnovo, supervises 28,750 offenders, a 12% reduction in the past 12 months. The National Probation Service is responsible for a further 10,071 higher-risk offenders.

But the inspection found that caseloads for individual probation officers ranged from 50 to 100 cases each and some senior probation officers were overseeing more than 900 cases. Despite the 12% fall in the number of offenders it supervised, the London CRC still had a 20% vacancy rate and was heavily reliant on agency staff. Officers were doing little more than “firefighting” rather than prioritising those offenders who posed the most risk of harm to the public.

Many individual probation officers had themselves received no formal supervision for many months and the sickness rate trebled between May and August this year from 23 to 70 off for more than three weeks.

“The lack of a credible system to monitor the cases when responsible officers were off sick had meant that too many service users had not been seen for weeks or months and, in some cases, had been lost in the system entirely,” said the official inspection report.

The watchdog’s report judges the overall effectiveness of the London CRC as “poor” and in particular criticises a lack of awareness of domestic abuse and child safeguarding issues.

Stacey said the publicly-run National Probation Service was delivering services better in London, but with plenty of room for improvement. The quality of work was mixed, but inspectors were pleased to find that, overall, public protection work was satisfactory. The delivery of court services was not entirely without problems.

“We expect the company to make every effort now to deliver the inviolable requirements – the basics of probation – consistently well, and as quickly as possible. We welcome work begun during our inspection to begin to bring about much-needed improvements, and will be back in 2017 to check on progress,” said Stacey.

Justice minister, Sam Gyimah, responded to the inspection findings, saying: “I met senior managers at London CRC and told them this is totally unacceptable. An urgent improvement plan is now in place and I will not hesitate to take more action if necessary. We are also working closely with the mayor’s office for policing and crime.

“We are currently looking at all contracts and are carrying out a comprehensive review of the probation system in England and Wales. This will improve the quality of our probation service, putting the focus on reducing reoffending by getting offenders off drugs and into training or work. Findings from the review will be published in April.”

Napo, the probation union, said the inspectorate had confirmed that privatisation would lead to greater public risk with its most damning report to date.

Ian Lawrence, Napo general secretary, said: “This report is a damning indictment of this government’s reckless social experiment. We urgently need probation services to be reviewed and publicly scrutinised to ensure public safety, quality service delivery and value for money to the taxpayer.”

Helda Swindenbank, London CRC’s director of probation, responded to the report saying: “The number one priority for London CRC is public protection, which is at the core of all that we do. Since the Inspection, we have continued to make significant progress in reducing caseloads managed by our staff, prompt enforcement, and quality of offender supervision.

“This is all informed by the high priority we give to protecting the public. We have already taken steps to ensure that every single case is being actively managed to further protect the public. It’s important to recognise that only 40 cases were inspected, just 0.13%, of London CRC’s caseload.”

Poland’s conservative parliament has passed a law restricting public meetings, which that has been slammed by the opposition as anti-democratic.

The legislation, passed late on Tuesday, introduces the concept of “periodic meetings” for rallies organised repeatedly in the same place and on the same date, giving such gatherings priority over other meetings. Under the new law, unrelated meetings must take place at least 100 metres (yards) away from any meeting designated “periodic”.

The ruling rightwing Law and Justice (PiS) party said the law would boost the security of participants at all gatherings by preventing clashes. But opposition lawmakers said the rules prevented “street dialogue” and restricted freedom of speech. They claim the law will allow PiS to organise a monthly meeting, protected from counter-protests, to commemorate the 2010 Smolensk plane crash.

Ninety-six people died including the country’s president, Lech Kaczyński, who was the twin brother of leader of PiS, Jarosław Kaczyński.

Last Saturday, the 80th such ceremony outside the presidential palace in Warsaw was slightly disturbed by an opposition rally.

The bill that was ultimately adopted did however shed provisions that would have given priority to rallies organised by the state and religious organisations.

Opposition politicians and rights activists claimed that the original proposals restricted fundamental rights and freedoms. European lawmakers joined Polish opposition politicians in criticising the law. “Yesterday was a sad day for Poland because now there is a new law governing protests which limits the right of assembly,” said Polish MEP Janusz Lewandowski in Strasbourg.

“Like all other EU citizens, Poles have the right to an independent judiciary ... Polish women have freedom of choice and Poles have the right to freedom of assembly, expression and thought,” said Dutch MEP Sophia in ’t Veld.

Tens of thousands of Poles took to the streets across the country to protest against the PiS government on Tuesday, the 35th anniversary of martial law in communist-ruled Poland.

Uber has launched an appeal against a landmark employment tribunal ruling that its minicab drivers should be classed as workers with access to the minimum wage, sick pay and paid holidays.

The taxi-app company filed papers with the appeal tribunal on Tuesday in an attempt to overturn the October judgment that, if it stands, could affect tens of thousands of workers in the gig economy.

The move came as several dozen Uber drivers picketed City Hall on Wednesday holding placards demanding Transport for London, which licences Uber as a private hire operator in the capital, “end sweated labour now”. It also mounted a protest at the City of London offices of Salesforce, a US computing company that is a major Uber client.

Two Uber drivers, James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam, took Uber to court on behalf of a group 19 others who argued that they were employed by the San Francisco-based company, rather than working for themselves. Uber’s business model has been based on treating drivers who log on to its app as self-employed contractors and taking a cut of their fares, which Uber dictates.

The employment tribunal judges were scathing about Uber’s case that drivers who use its phone app to pick up fares were self-employed.

“The notion that Uber in London is a mosaic of 30,000 small businesses linked by a common ‘platform’ is to our minds faintly ridiculous,” they said. “Drivers do not and cannot negotiate with passengers … They are offered and accept trips strictly on Uber’s terms.”

Farrar said Uber’s appeal was expected but was “really disappointing”. “It means we have to fight again, but why?” he said. “It is just because they don’t want to pay the minimum wage. We are confident. Our case is rock solid and the original judgment was emphatic.”

Jo Bertram, Uber’s UK general manager, said: “Tens of thousands of people in London drive with Uber precisely because they want to be self-employed and their own boss. The overwhelming majority of drivers who use the Uber app want to keep the freedom and flexibility of being able to drive when and where they want.”

Meanwhile, 25 more Uber drivers are planning to claim workers’ rights from Uber and have joined the legal action the law firm Leigh Day is bringing with the GMB union.

“Since the judgment was issued, we and GMB have spoken to hundreds of Uber drivers who wish to claim compensation for Uber’s failure to provide these entitlements in the past, as well as to ensure that they are paid at least the national minimum wage and holiday pay in future,” said Nigel MacKay, the lawyer representing the claimants.

“We are issuing claims on behalf of those drivers and the latest 25 claimants who have joined the legal action will be included in claims for compensation. We anticipate issuing further claims on behalf of drivers in the coming weeks.”

Leigh Day believes there may be thousands of drivers who can claim for the money and benefits they have not received as drivers for Uber.

Uber’s appeal comes amid mounting concern within the government about the growing trend towards self-employed workforces. The government has recently announced a six-month review of modern working practices and HMRC is setting up a new unit, the employment status and intermediaries team, to investigate companies.

Last week Frank Field, the chairman of the House of Commons work and pensions select committee, published a report including the testimonies of 83 Uber drivers, which claimed that they had almost no independence.

Field’s report, contested by Uber, said the company dictates drivers’ working patterns once they have logged on, imposes lockouts from its system if drivers turn down too many jobs, and has raised its commission while cutting the rates drivers can charge. This, combined with the cost of the vehicles needed to meet Uber’s requirements, is creating “chronically low pay” and insecurity, the report said.

The British government and parliament have failed the people of Syria, yet again. Like rabbits caught in headlights they have no plan of practical action to save civilian lives.

Yesterday’s debate in the House of Commons was all tears and talk. There was no vote to do anything. Theresa May’s absence and the lack of a government action plan signalled that Downing Street is not taking the plight of civilians seriously.

Boris Johnson’s futile rant against Bashar al-Assad and Putin looked like bluster to cover up his own lack of proposals. Yet again he offered more excuses; mistakenly claiming that aid drops are impossible because they’d put RAF planes and aircrew at risk of being shot down. In fact, aid could be delivered by pilotless drones and GPS-guided parachutes.

While all the focus is now on Aleppo, we need to remember that nearly five million Syrians are living in other besieged and hard-to-access cities, towns and villages. Aid drops are urgently needed. Britain and other states with the capacity must act now.

Last Friday, by 122 votes to 13, the UN general assembly demanded a ceasefire in Syria; an end to all sieges and the delivery of humanitarian aid to the suffering populations. This gives the UK and other countries a UN mandate to carry out air drops of food, medicine, blankets and fuel. These are desperately needed by starving, freezing and wounded civilians.

The other urgent priority right now is to protect Syrians from massacre in territory seized by Assad. We remember the killings after Yarmouk, Darayya and Homs were captured by his soldiers. This must not be allowed to happen again, as regime troops take over the rest of Aleppo.

To prevent or minimise the possibility of a slaughter ensuing, the UK should be pressing the UN to send in observers to monitor civilians, backed up by peacekeepers, as soon as possible. Their presence would deter disappearances, torture and extrajudicial murders – and these must be documented if, heaven forbid, they happen.

Our government and others should issue warrants for the arrest of parties to the conflict – primarily the Syrian government and military – who have been responsible for mass torture. We have the legal authority to do this under the UN Convention Against Torture 1984 and section 134 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988. Although getting them to trial might be difficult – at least in the short term – this would be a powerful, symbolic gesture and would send a deterrent signal to would-be torturers.

Finally, the UK government ought to take the lead in securing a UN agreement to set up a Syria war crimes tribunal, similar to those established in the wake of the Yugoslav and Rwandan conflicts. Its remit should be to prosecute all war criminals on all sides, including war crimes by the Assad and Putin regimes, Isis and other Islamist groups, the Free Syrian Army and even possible criminal acts by US-led coalition forces.

Britain should aim to bring on board other countries to back and implement these initiatives, creating an international drive for serious, concrete action to save civilian lives – and to bring to justice war criminals and perpetrators of crimes against humanity. The time for talk and hand-wringing is over. Syrians need action now.

The former senior counsel on the national child abuse inquiry has been cleared of any wrongdoing in an independent investigation by his chambers. Ben Emmerson QC, who quit the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse (IICSA) in September, was named in a BBC Newsnight programme after an inquiry worker revealed details of an alleged sexual assault in a lift.

The abuse inquiry, under the chairmanship of Prof Alexis Jay, has repeatedly refused to release any further information about Emmerson’s departure. His law chambers, Matrix, set up an independent inquiry into the allegations of sexual assault and sexual harassment. It was led by the former director of public prosecutions, Sir David Calvert-Smith.

Matrix said on Wednesday: “After examining the evidence, Sir David submitted his final report to the management committee earlier this week. In his report, Sir David concluded ‘without hesitation’ that Mr Emmerson had not committed any act of sexual assault or sexual harassment.”

Welcoming the inquiry’s findings, Emmerson said: “This has been a difficult period and I am naturally very pleased that an independent senior judge has now confirmed that the allegations against me were always unfounded. I hope that the inquiry can now be left to get on with its important work, free from unnecessary distractions.”

Emmerson resigned after being suspended by the inquiry over concerns, it said, “about aspects of Mr Emmerson’s leadership of the counsel team”. The prime minister, Theresa May, was forced to step in to express her confidence in the inquiry, which is costing £100m over five years.

A review of the inquiry’s work, which has been carried out by Jay, is due to be published in the near future.

The allegation of sexual harassment was not put to Emmerson before he resigned from the inquiry. Panel members on the inquiry were made aware of the allegations. The highly experienced QC had already made his decision to leave the child abuse inquiry before he was told about the allegation.

In the meantime, IICSA has formally launched a separate, independent examination of the way Emmerson’s resignation was handled. It may now ask why Emmerson was not asked about the now discredited allegation at the time so that he could respond.

Emmerson is now back working on international cases, his previous area of legal specialisation. 



The human rights campaigner Helena Kennedy, who has worked with Emmerson, welcomed the independent inquiry’s finding that dismissed the allegations of sexual misconduct. 



“I have known Ben for many, many years,” Lady Kennedy said. “He’s a feminist. He lives as he speaks. He had discussed this matter with me. He’s not someone who takes liberties with people. I shared his shock when a public allegation was made. I’m satisfied that it was ill-founded.”

“We oppose any religious body – whether presided over by men or women – that seeks to rule over us.” So say more than 300 mostly Muslim women, but also others from different faiths who have been abused in their personal lives. These women are voicing their alarm, through a powerful statement published by Open Democracy, about the growing power of religious bodies such as sharia councils, and demand that their voices also be heard in the current debate.

From their own lived experiences, they warn against any attempt to normalise profoundly regressive religious codes of conduct as the basis of social interaction with, and policy development aimed at, minority women. They do so against the backdrop of Louise Casey’s report that warns of minority women who are trapped in abuse and isolation, and two ongoing inquiries into sharia councils: one initiated by the government and the other by the home affairs select committee.

The signatories to the statement have witnessed, experienced or fled from the horrors and degradations of “honour” killings, domestic violence, child and ritual abuse, forced marriage, polygamy, rape and sexual assaults. They speak out against religious impositions that exacerbate their daily struggles to live their lives as they choose. They reject the forces of fundamentalism and patriarchy that seek to divide and govern through surveillance and control of female sexuality.

These women remind us of the inherent dangers faced by all vulnerable minority women when religious fundamentalists masquerade as “guardians of faith” in order to take control of personal and family relationships. They speak out against the forces that would squeeze out the richness of cultural diversity and the life-affirming values of tolerance, humanity and compassion. As they put it, their ability to freely share and partake in diverse religious and secular traditions, creates “small pieces of happiness” in otherwise relentlessly difficult circumstances.

In our day-to-day work at Southall Black Sisters, we find little evidence to suggest that marginalised women within minority communities want engagement with the “marketplace” of Islamic or other religious ideals in family matters. The women we work with readily recognise that religion is itself implicated in the violence they experience, and in the community and state structures of power that militate against their rights. This insight is, of course, behind many struggles for equality and accountability that women have waged within and outside of the formal legal system.

The experiences of these women tell us that the entrenchment of sharia councils and parallel legal systems within minority communities creates a space for the perpetuation of patriarchal control and harm to women, children and others perceived to be apostates, atheists and nonconformists. Secular feminist spaces – the long fought for and now beleaguered refuges and advocacy centres – are their best hope of accessing justice. Secular – not religious – spaces provide vulnerable minority women with alternatives to violence, isolation and fear, creating opportunities to build solidarity based on need and not religious or communal identity. The evidence and testimonies gathered from such women have been submitted to the home affairs select committee by Southall Black Sisters and our coalition partners as part of the One Law for All campaign.

Sadly, these warnings are necessary because fundamentalist demands are embraced by some in feminist circles who claim to speak from positions of faith while failing to recognise the political dimensions of resurgent religious fundamentalist movements in the UK. Disconcertingly, this form of faith-based feminism is also co-opted by religious fundamentalists. By using the language of female “agency” and “choice”, they strengthen patriarchal structures of power and subvert the emancipatory goals of feminism and human rights. Feminism in minority communities has reached a critical juncture, caught in the eye of powerful reactionary forces of religion and racism.

Rather than oppose both in equal measure, the imperatives of religious identity politics appear to lead some faith-based feminists to align themselves with the religious right and thereby strip their politics of its progressive and ethical content. Such a stance is not any the less regressive simply because some Muslim women may refer themselves – or be referred by others acting on their behalf – to sharia councils.

Those of us who try to challenge religious laws – on the basis of long-established secular feminist principles, international human rights and gender equality laws – are increasingly labelled “anti-faith”, “unrepresentative” or “Islamophobic”. But we work to help the most marginalised women – like those who signed today’s statement – to build feminist cultures based on common and universal values of human rights, citizenship and the rule of law. We work to prevent the entrenchment of deeply misogynist and highly unaccountable religious power; a power that, once established, will not be easily relinquished in the current climate of social and economic instability.

For the record, Southall Black Sisters has never claimed, and will never claim, to represent or speak on behalf of Muslim women or anyone else. We have spent our political lives opposing self-appointed religious and community leaders who allocate to themselves the power to speak on behalf of entire communities. Some claim their views to be representative of the voice of “Muslim women”. We choose not to assume such a mantle for any group of women. Our only endeavour is to advocate for the rights of all black and minority women – those of all religious backgrounds and none – in the face of racism, discrimination, violence and inhuman and degrading treatment by their families, communities and the state. We will not forsake the experiences of our Muslim sisters who, like other women, arrive at our doors desperately seeking access to justice.

Our demand is simple: no religious arbitration of any kind in family matters. We want a secular law underpinned by human rights values to be applicable to all, without exception. As the One Law for All campaign has continued to assert, this is the only way to guarantee freedom of religion as well as freedom from religion. The challenges we face are too important to be reduced to a crude and regressive politics of representation.

A Briton who wanted to stop his former partner taking their children to live in an American state where the Mormon church is based has lost a family court fight.

The Mormon woman asked a judge to allow her to move their six-year-old son and three-year-old daughter to Utah.

She told Mr Justice Bodey that she had married an American Mormon construction worker and wanted to join him in the US. Her former partner objected and said their daughter might be “treated in an inferior way” in Utah.

But Bodey approved the woman’s relocation application. Details of the case have emerged in a ruling by the judge following a private family court hearing in Middlesbrough.

The children had lived with their mother after she and their father separated, the judge heard. She said her ex-partner had “lost interest” in seeing the children.

Bodey, who is based in the family division of the high court in London, concluded that a move to Utah would be in the children’s best interests and said the pros outweighed the cons.

The judge said there was no evidence that the little girl would suffer inferior treatment and the mother’s plans were realistic and thought through. Evidence suggested that she would be better off financially and the judge said she would be living with her husband in a place where she wanted to “make her life”.

She had said she wanted the children to grow up knowing their father and his family.

Jason knew he wouldn’t and shouldn’t get the job. Yet his jobcentre adviser told him to apply to the pharmaceutical warehouse anyway. The problem? “I’m a convicted drug dealer. They won’t even let me set foot in the place.”

Like many of the former prisoners I’ve met recently through my research for the Centre for Justice Innovation, Jason knows only too well the stigma of having done time. He’s also become aware of the limited advice out there for ex-prisoners wanting to make a fresh start.

Ex-prisoners we spoke to held out little hope of receiving help from places like Jobcentre Plus and local authority housing teams. In fact, we heard stories of subtle discrimination from the very public sector bodies which they rely on. As one person told us: “They don’t have a clue … The moment you come through the door they’ve got a judgment on you.” Former offenders are being neglected by services that don’t understand their needs and are often labelled as problematic or aggressive.

This matters. People coming out of prison need all the help they can get. Ministry of Justice research (pdf) has shown that former prisoners who have a stable home on release are 15% less likely to reoffend. Those with a job are 20% less likely to commit another crime. In a climate where homes and jobs are scarce offenders need all the help they can get. Nearly two in five prisoners (37%) say that they will need help finding a place to live when they are released (pdf). Three out of four don’t have a job lined up on release (pdf).

The difficulties that former prisoners face are compounded by the shadow of their criminal past. Our research has uncovered many stories of prisoners facing discrimination and prejudice. Margaret, an articulate woman in her forties, was fired after several years working in a job, accused of lying about her criminal record on her original application form. In reality, no one had thought to ask. Then there’s Ahmed, whose health was suffering as a result of damp in his rented flat. When he asked the landlord to fix it he was forced to leave, on the spurious pretext that he was intimidating his neighbours.

If we are to reduce the £15bn annual cost of reoffending we have to tackle this uncomfortable truth. Clearly, part of the solution is for welfare agencies to get better at working with people who’ve been to prison. In practice, the best way to tackle prejudice is to equip and expect prisoners to stand up for themselves. 



In theory, the hundreds of voluntary advice centres around the country should offer a solution. Citizens advice bureaus (CABs), law centres and independent advice providers specialise in helping people to understand and challenge poor treatment. However, they have been hit by a perfect storm of funding cuts and rising demand. Even the most determined now find it hard to access these services. For former prisoners conditioned to expect disappointment, ploughing through the system often feels a waste of time.

We did find a few stand out, advice projects which work alongside probation and prisons. Ipswich Housing Action Group, for example, has been running debt clinics in prisons for 10 years. They help prisoners to clear debts and rent arrears so they can find a place to live on release. Coventry CAB developed a dedicated advice clinic for people on probation, housing, debt, benefits and employment issues. However, resources for these services are scarce. Coventry’s dedicated clinic, like many others, closed with the restructuring of probation in 2015. Likewise, the Ipswich service has reduced its scope.

We would like to see probation and prisons, especially the newly autonomous prisons that are meant to be standard bearers for rehabilitation, to invest in advice for prisoners, both inside and on release. However, we recognise that the justice system is itself struggling with budget cuts.

There’s no quick fix. Perhaps we can learn from advice givers who are taking on the challenges of austerity. Hackney law centre in London has trained up local clergy to provide a kind of advice first aid. With their links to people in the community the clergy are well-placed to diagnose and respond to the straightforward issues. People with more complex problems are pointed towards the right source of help. This has proved so effective, that plans are now afoot to turn the training programme into a smartphone app. Perhaps there’s something in this approach that probation could borrow in their work with offenders.

Our public services are looking at a future of being called on to do more for less. Apps and volunteers are by no means a silver bullet. But with imaginative training, simple technology and strategic investment, we can help former prisoners challenge prejudice and lay the foundations of a new life. Ultimately, that’s not just good for Jason, Margaret and Ahmed, it’s good for all of us.

EU nationals living in Britain should make a file of documents that prove they have lived in the country since before the June referendum, according to the chair of a House of Lords committee.

Helena Kennedy QC suggested collecting together bills, rental or home ownership documents, employment paperwork, or evidence of appointments for those who do not have jobs.

“Make a file now with proof of your presence [and] supporting letters from people who’ve known you, you have taught you or who you have had business dealings with,” said Lady Kennedy in an interview with the Guardian.

The peer chairs a Lords EU subcommittee that has just completed an investigation into the “acquired rights” of Europeans in the UK and Britons living in continental Europe. She warned of deep anxiety among EU citizens in the UK but also British nationals living on the continent.

After hearing from a series of experts, ambassadors from across Europe and Britons living overseas, the group will on Wednesday call for a unilateral undertaking to immediately guarantee to safeguard the rights of all EU nationals in the UK.

Saying that Theresa May has a “heavy moral obligation” to make the first move, it also warns:

Its report also concludes that international law may not provide much reassurance for EU citizens. “The evidence we received makes very clear that the doctrine of acquired rights under public international law will provide little, if any, effective protection for former EU rights once the UK withdraws from the EU,” it says.

Evidence heard by the peers on the EU justice subcommittee suggested that asking those who qualified to remainin Britain to apply for permanent residence would result in a “vast” administrative burden on government.

Instead the committee urged the government to consider a simple “new status” for all Europeans in Britain before a set date.

Although its report does not suggest EU citizens collect their documents together, Kennedy told the Guardian it would be sensible to argue that people should make arrangements, especially if they did not have a paper trail through employment.

She said the rights that experts had warned the committee about included being able to travel, set up businesses, be in employment, qualify for benefits, access education and healthcare, and retain a pension.

“Pensions are one of the great sources of anxiety because will you be able to transport it? There is a lot of talk about ‘passporting’ of the financial services at a grand level, but what about the passporting of people’s ordinary rights?” she said.

The prime minister has expressed a desire to protect the rights of EU citizens living in Britain, but has said that it must be part of reciprocal deal in which Britons on the continent were offered the same protections.

Kennedy, a leading human rights lawyer, said May had a political desire to take action. The peer added that she believed the government wanted to secure a deal but that the best action would be to take the first step.

“It should be done unilaterally. They should say, ‘We will protect everyone at this moment of time,’” Kennedy said, arguing that would earn goodwill.

She said that to avoid an influx of people moving to Britain , the cut off deadline should either be the June referendum, or the moment at which May makes a declaration.



Kennedy spoke about representations to her committee: including employers in the care industry who asked whether they ought to be advising EU workers to return home; European citizens who were asking about their children entering secondary school; and others who had entered British saving schemes. 



She also talked of a Briton with a Polish wife, whose widowed mother was nervous about a move to the UK because she feared losing access to healthcare.

Kennedy also pointed to fears listed in the report submitted by Britons living in continental Europe. They include the state pension concerns of a 55-year old woman with disabilities in Frankfurt, concerns about a marital break up in France and the right to continue working as a doctor, and worries about access to healthcare in Greece.

Her committee’s next job is to look at the impact of Brexit on other issues including the family courts, and how divorce proceedings and custody arrangements might be affected.

Sarah Ludford, who sits on the committee and is the Liberal Democrats’ Brexit spokeswoman in the Lords, added: “The government has a clear moral as well as economic responsibility to commit now to guaranteeing the rights of all EU nationals living in the UK.

“These people have built their lives in Britain and are our neighbours, colleagues and friends, they must not be reduced to pawns in the government’s Brexit negotiations.”



Lady Ludford said a unilateral move would foster reciprocity towards UK citizens and would lift a “cloud of uncertainty over some 5 million people”.

My sister, Charlotte Bayntun-Coward, who has died aged 77, was a remarkable person. On one level she was an elegant woman who lived in a beautiful house outside Bath, adored her family and gave wonderful parties. But she was also a passionate advocate for the vulnerable in and around Bath.

Charlotte was born in Chesham Bois, Buckinghamshire, daughter of John Gibbons, who worked for the Arts Council when he returned from a PoW camp in Germany after the second world war, and his wife, Mersa (nee Foster), a teacher and artist. Charlotte did not take full advantage of her education, leaving school with virtually no qualifications. She worked as a dental nurse, as an assistant to the actor Donald Wolfit, and for the BBC in Bristol before her marriage in 1963 to the antiquarian bookseller Hylton Bayntun-Coward.

But once her children were born, Charlotte went to Bath Technical college (now Bath College) to study for her A-levels and duly went on to train as a social worker. She became a magistrate, fostered newborn babies awaiting adoption and got a job as a social worker at her local GP practice.

When she was 50 she became the almoner of St John’s hospital, Bath, which provides almshouse accommodation and grants, a role that allowed her to support vulnerable people in practical ways. She stayed at St John’s for 25 years, finally retiring at the age of 75.

She also worked for a whole range of other organisations, including those concerned with mental health (our father suffered from schizophrenia so she always felt affinity with people with mental health issues) and homelessness. She worked phenomenally hard, but she also knew how to have fun and loved travelling – to east Africa, Russia, the US, Norway, Mozambique, Turkey and India.

Hylton died in 2000. Charlotte is survived by her children, Emma, Edward, Polly and Jo, 12 grandchildren, her companion, Tony, her brother, William, and me.

He was one of Margaret Thatcher’s favourite ministers, wasn’t he? That’s right. A tough and traditional rightwing Eurosceptic Tory.

They’re becoming fashionable again. So I hear. But Tebbit’s worried.

How so? We’re leaving the EU, and the Tories are a million points ahead in the polls. Yes but he has written in the Telegraph that he is worried about “the increasing proportion of our population who simply do not accept many basic assumptions about how [our] society should be organised”.

I agree. Recent attacks on the judges who ruled against the government on Brexit show a contempt for the rule of law which is the basis of British freedom. Ah, no. Those aren’t the people he was worried about.

Who then? It’s the Muslims.

Ah yes. “Until very recently in our society,” he says, “child marriage, bigamy, divorce at the will of the male partner, the imprisonment of wives at the will of their husband, female genital mutilation and abortion on the grounds of the sex of the unborn child were unacceptable and indeed criminal offences.”

Those things are all still unacceptable and are all still criminal offences. Perhaps Tebbit has got Britain confused with, ooh I don’t know, Sudan. I don’t think so. He says that British law is being challenged by “a rival legal system with its own courts such as that now represented by the network of sharia law”, and as a result “Islam challenges our way of life in our own country”. He also says political correctness stops “the establishment” from talking about it.

Is any of this true? Nope. There are some unofficial sharia “councils” around the UK, but they have no legal force. Some Muslims might decide to follow their rulings, just like a Christian couple might ask their priest what to do, or anyone might toss a coin. None of it is binding unless you also sign a contract to bind yourself under British law.

So the establishment isn’t talking about it, because it isn’t happening? Oh, the establishment is talking about it all right, because it’s such a popular myth. Theresa May launched a review into sharia law earlier this year.

Perhaps Lord Tebbit missed that? No doubt he did.

Do say: “That Judge Rinder, he’s a challenge to the supremacy of statute.”

Don’t say: “That Enoch Powell, he had the right idea.”

The women were mothers and teenagers, waitresses and aspiring actresses. They had chance encounters with Bill Cosby and long-term friendships. But they all tell a similar story: of how Cosby, at the height of his fame, incapacitated them with laced drinks or mystery pills and then sexually assaulted them.

Now, the battle begins over whether they can tell those stories in court.

Prosecutors in Montgomery County, where the legendary entertainer is on trial for three felony counts of aggravated indecent assault, will argue on Tuesday for a judge to allow 13 of Cosby’s accusers to testify. The 13 women, none of whose accusations have resulted in criminal charges, accuse Cosby of crimes ranging from inappropriate touching to rape, in incidents dating all the way back to the 1960s.

Judge Steven O’Neill’s decision, which will follow two days of legal argument, could wind up being one of the most influential in the entire case. Without forensic evidence, witnesses, or a timely police report to present, prosecutors may struggle to convict Cosby. The current prosecutor’s predecessor, Bruce Castor, has expressed skepticism that a jury would find Cosby guilty unless other several other accusers testified to a pattern of behavior.

The criminal case unfolding in Norristown, Pennsylvania, arises from accusations made by Andrea Constand, a former Temple University employee and a onetime mentee of Cosby’s, that he drugged and digitally penetrated her at his home in 2004.

Constand’s accusations are bolstered by damaging remarks that Cosby himself made during civil litigation. But prosecutors are eager to summon the power of the accusations against Cosby made in the media to the courtroom. 



Although more than 50 women have accused Cosby of crimes ranging from inappropriate touching to rape, the statute of limitations for most of those allegations has expired. The case in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, therefore, is likely to be the only instance of criminal prosecution – and the only opportunity many of Cosby’s accusers have to confront him in court. 



Normally, prosecutors are barred from presenting testimony about prior bad acts committed by a criminal defendant, on the basis that such evidence can prejudice the jury. But Pennsylvania is one of several states that permits such testimony if it speaks to a criminal pattern. 



Several patterns emerge when reading the accounts of the 13 women willing to testify that Cosby violated them sexually. The women are mostly young and all of them claim that Cosby incapacitated them with spiked drinks, unidentified pills or pills he presented as “headache cures”.

Some of the women had fleeting encounters with Cosby – as cocktail waitresses or flight attendants. But several said they considered Cosby a friend or mentor. A masseuse who claims Cosby drugged and raped her said he first made an effort to “ingratiate himself with her family”. A waitress who accuses Cosby of drugging a glass of wine he gave her said Cosby doted on and mentored her young son. She claims Cosby invited her to attend one of his performances and used the limousine ride to the theater to drug and assault her.

In earlier hearings and court filings, attorneys for Cosby hinted that they would put up a bruising fight. One document revealed that Cosby’s defense team had already begun to look for unflattering details about his accusers – such as one woman’s connection to drug smugglers. Cosby’s attorneys have also argued that the age of some of the allegations make them impossible to disprove, because Cosby would be hard-pressed to recall details and several of the accusers could not name a date, time or place where the assault allegedly occurred.

“We are left with reports that were prepared by their detectives just recently,” said Brian McMonagle, one of Cosby’s attorneys, at a recent hearing. Their accusations, he said, amount to “sometime, somewhere, someplace Bill Cosby did something to me”.

The women are anonymous in the court filings, but 10 of them have told their stories in detail under their full names in the media.

Prosecutors interviewed dozens of accusers who do not appear on their list of 13 potential witnesses, other Cosby accusers told the Philadelphia Inquirer. They seemed to rule out women whose stories were not highly similar to Constand’s.

Constand is a former employee of Temple University, where Cosby studied for several years in his youth and still holds an honorary bachelor’s degree. In January 2005, she reported to police that Cosby, whom she considered a mentor, gave her drugs at his Pennsylvania home and fondled her while she drifted in and out of consciousness. The incident took place in 2004, she claims.

Castor, who was Montgomery County’s top prosecutor at the time, declined to bring charges, and Cosby quietly settled Constand’s claims in civil court in 2006.

Then, in 2015, the Associated Press published excerpts of Cosby’s deposition in that civil case. In the deposition, he admitted to obtaining quaaludes to give to women for the purpose of obtaining sex. He also acknowledged giving Constand three unspecified pills before their sexual encounter. The new top prosecutor, Kevin Steele, the district attorney, announced charges just before the statute of limitations expired.

The deposition could be a key piece of evidence against Cosby when the case goes to trial.

Also potentially damaging is a recording of a decade-old phone call between Cosby and Constand’s mother, Gianna. In a previous hearing, Cosby’s defense and the prosecutors sparred over whether Cosby knew the call was recorded, or was misled.

In his 2005 deposition, Cosby said he apologized to Gianna during that phone call for having sexual contact with her daughter. “I’m apologizing because I’m thinking this is a dirty old man with a young girl,” Cosby said in the deposition. Cosby maintains that his sexual encounter with Constand was consensual.

Cosby’s trial is scheduled to begin on 5 June 2017.

A strike by train drivers has brought Southern services to a halt after the court of appeal rejected a second attempt by the rail company to block the action.

Judges upheld last week’s ruling by the high court to dismiss claims by Southern’s owner, Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR), that industrial action called by the train drivers’ union, Aslef, infringed rights under European law.

GTR had already urged passengers not to travel on Tuesday, irrespective of the court’s decision, warning that it would not be able to run a service.

Drivers will also strike on Wednesday and Friday this week, and plan six consecutive days of strikes in January. An ongoing overtime ban on the short-staffed train service is further affecting services, even on non-strike days.

Charles Horton, GTR’s chief executive, said the company was disappointed by the court of appeal’s ruling: “Regrettably, there will be no train services for passengers tomorrow, Wednesday and Friday. We strongly advise people not to travel.

“We will now be asking Acas to convene urgent and immediate talks between GTR and Aslef; talks that we hoped to get moving over the weekend, but Aslef would not agree. Our aim is to find a resolution to their dispute so we can bring an end to the misery being suffered by the travelling public.”

But Mick Whelan, general secretary of Aslef, said the strike had been forced by an intransigent management. “Industrial action is always the last resort. Even now, all we want is for the company to sit down with us and negotiate – properly, sensibly and in good faith, not to simply restate their old entrenched position – and do a deal for the benefit of passengers, staff and, of course, the company.”

The court ruling came as Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, stepped up his attack on the rail unions, claiming that they were demanding “not just to stop the current modernisation process, but to start reversing 30 years of working practice changes right across the country”.

Grayling wrote to MPs on Monday to reiterate his belief that the strikes were politically motivated, saying he did not want to further politicise the dispute by taking part in negotiations.

He wrote: “When I met the general secretary of Aslef soon after my appointment, with virtually his first breath he promised me ‘10 years of industrial action’. I have therefore believed it better to avoid direct ministerial involvement in negotiations during the autumn, as my involvement would make the issue even more political than it is.”

Whelan, however, said that Grayling was “being less than honest on all counts” and accused him of selectively quoting “a private meeting I had with him held, in good faith, under Chatham House rules”.

Grayling’s letter also claimed that “Aslef didn’t turn up” to talks with Southern and had refused a further offer of talks without preconditions on Monday, adding that these were “not the actions of a union that wants to act to get services back to normal”.

An Aslef spokesman said: “The secretary of state is being incredibly disingenuous, as nothing had been arranged, so there was nothing to which we could turn up.”

The home secretary, Amber Rudd, added to criticism of unions, branding the action “totally unacceptable”.

Andy McDonald, the shadow transport secretary, said it was an insult to passengers to blame Southern’s failures on trade unions rather than the incompetence of management and government ministers. He said: “As commuters are well aware, Southern’s sub-standard service predates any industrial action and trains are cancelled, late and dangerously overcrowded every day regardless of strike action.

“The truth is that ministers are defending this failed franchise as a point of political pride when they should be sticking up for taxpayers and commuters.”

Commuters are planning a protest march on Thursday from Southern’s main London hub, Victoria station, to the Department of Transport.

The Association of British Commuters is demanding an immediate government intervention in the dispute and a public inquiry into the collapse of Southern rail services. It also called on Grayling to act or resign.

Welcome to the Guardian’s weekly Brexit briefing, a summary of developments as Britain moves towards the EU exit. If you’d like to receive it as a weekly email, please sign up here (and check your spam folder if you don’t see it in your inbox).



A heads-up, also, that the Guardian has launched a Brexit podcast: Brexit Means… The first episode offers a brief history of Brexit and you can listen to it here. Episode two looks at article 50 and the various legal challenges to it. It will be out next week.

Producing the Guardian’s independent, in-depth journalism takes a lot of time and money. But we do it because we believe our perspective matters – and it might well be your perspective too. If you value our Brexit coverage, become a Guardian Supporter and help make our future more secure. Thank you.

Win, loss or score draw? The jury is still out on whether Theresa May suffered a grievous defeat at the hands of parliament last week or pulled off a resounding victory. Or whether it was perhaps a bit of both.

What happened, first, was that Labour joined forces with a bunch of Conservative rebels to demand that the prime minister publish the government’s plan for Brexit before article 50 is triggered and the UK starts the two-year divorce process.

This she promised to do – whereupon MPs led by the astute shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, insisted the plan must actually be a plan, as opposed to some vague hope (as in the now-familiar “get the best possible deal for Britain”).

Starmer insisted that to qualify as a plan, it must answer key questions. such as would the UK seek to stay in the customs union and the single market, but also provide enough detail for MPs to scrutinise it and economists to assess its impact.

Remainers saw it as a big win in the battle for more clarity on the government’s somewhat opaque Brexit strategy.

Leavers, however, insisted ministers had won, because it was never said how much detail the “plan” would actually contain – and because in the same non-binding vote, MPs also promised to let the government trigger Brexit by the end of March.

By approving Labour’s motion – demanding a Brexit plan – and the government amendment – setting an article 50 deadline – parliament had in effect given the government “a blank Brexit cheque”, leavers argued.

Remainers, of course, denied this, mainly because the supreme court – which spent four enthralling days hearing submissions on the question – may decide ministers cannot trigger article 50 without passing a whole new bill anyway.

That, obviously, would demand another parliamentary vote. As they showed last week, MPs are highly unlikely to vote against any proposed article 50 legislation (that would be “defying the will of the people”).

But they could significantly amend it, forcing May, for example, to put a lot more meat on the bones of the government’s plan than she would like to. The 11 judges announce their decision in January; it will be a big moment.

On Monday, the chancellor, Philip Hammond, told MPs – in slightly convoluted fashion – that the government would be likely to seek a transitional deal to help smooth the Brexit process, confirming that in his view it may well take longer than two years to complete negotiations:

Whether the UK will be offered such a deal is not clear; EU officials have not shown themselves particularly keen thus far.

The EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, put the cat among the pigeons somewhat, saying – to London’s apparent surprise – that Britain would have less than 18 months to secure its article 50 divorce.

The Frenchman said the EU would need a few weeks to sort out its negotiating stance at the beginning of the article 50 process and a few months to ratify the agreement at the end. He also laid out the key principles of the bloc’s approach.



The EU would seek first and foremost to preserve the unity and interests of its 27 remaining members, he said, and would continue to refuse all negotiation before notification. Brexit must be a worse deal for Britain than EU membership, and curbs on free movement were not compatible with full access to the single market:

Barnier also said it was “difficult to imagine” an interim deal at present, without knowing exactly what kind of final deal the UK might want.

Elsewhere, Matteo Renzi’s defeat in a referendum on constitutional reform was greeted by Eurosceptics everywhere as another nail in the coffin of the EU. It was hardly a welcome development, but there was little to suggest the result had much to do with Europe: this was not Italy’s Brexit moment.

And just a few hours earlier, Alexander Van der Bellen, the overtly pro-European leftist candidate in Austria’s presidential elections, defeated Norbert Hofer, whose party was founded by a former SS officer, prompting heady talk of a post-Brexit bounce in support for the ailing European project.

With elections in the Netherlands, France and Germany, 2017 will tell us more.

Westminster’s focus this week was again partly directed elsewhere, on a byelection. But while last week’s upset in Richmond pointed to a remainers’ rebellion, Thursday’s vote in Lincolnshire’s Sleaford and Hykeham brought another message.

Yes, the Conservatives were expected to keep the strongly pro-leave seat, with Ukip maybe to finish second. The message, perhaps, came in the relegation of Labour from a strongish second to a miserable fourth, behind the Lib Dems.

As one alarmed Labour MP theorised, in trying to balance its Brexit strategy between the will of the 52% of leave voters and 48% of remainers, the party may have ended up annoying both and becoming “the party of the 0%”.

The warning did not seemingly focus minds in the party, where two senior MPs, Diane Abbott and Andy Burnham, spent the weekend saying precisely opposite things on post-Brexit freedom of movement.

The former party leader Ed Miliband also entered the fray, formally coming out for a softer Brexit, and saying limited curbs to immigration were a necessary price to pay for single market membership.

Elsewhere, some conspiracy-minded types have wondered whether the fuss over Theresa May’s leather trousers is an example of the dead cat strategy. More likely, it’s just an indicator of how poisonous relations have become between the PM and some of her more rebellious backbenchers.

The former education secretary Nicky Morgan was barred from a Downing Street Brexit meeting with May for talking disparagingly about the £995 trousers, a snub that escalated with the leak of furious texts between Morgan and May’s chief of staff. (More fashion-minded types thought the real scandal lay elsewhere: who wears baggy leather trousers?)

Matthew d’Ancona reckons Theresa May was pretty clever with her amendment in the Commons last week, and her article 50 ruse has caught the remainers off-guard:

In the FT (paywall), Jana Ganesh argues beautifully that Britain’s refusal to accept that continentals actually mean what they say is a cultural difference that is doing the UK no favours at all:

And back in the Guardian, Rafael Behr says May risks becoming an “accidental Europe-wrecker” by feeding a Ukip-inspired image of the EU:

If you missed it, Rupert Myers from GQ live-tweeted what really happened in the supreme court last week. It was quite a party.

Letters: After more than 300 years of asserting parliamentary supremacy, the ghost of royal tyranny returns to haunt us

Barack Obama has agreed to preserve the Senate’s landmark investigation into the CIA’s use of torture after 9/11, but his decision ensures that the document remains out of public view for at least 12 years and probably longer.



Obama’s decision, revealed in a letter from White House counsel W Neil Eggleston, prevents Republican Richard Burr, the Senate intelligence committee chairman who has been highly critical of the investigation, from destroying existing classified copies of the December 2014 report.

Daniel Jones, a former committee staffer who led the torture inquiry, criticized the preservation as inadequate.

“The bar for positive White House action on this is incredibly low. Preserving the full 6,700-page report under the Presidential Records Act only ensures the report will not be destroyed,” Jones said. “It does little else.”

The full Senate torture report, which documented brutality by the CIA against at least 119 detained terrorism suspects, will be held out of public view at Obama’s presidential library.

Democrat Dianne Feinstein of California, Burr’s predecessor as chair and now the vice-chair of the Senate intelligence committee, said on Monday she was “pleased” Obama had placed the inquiry she spearheaded into his presidential record. Feinstein noted the document would “one day be available for declassification”.

But that day, according to secrecy and intelligence experts, is a long way off.

Eggleston wrote to Feinstein on Friday that the classified version of the report, over 6,700 pages in length, will remain restricted under a legal provision, the Presidential Records Act, for 12 years.

“At this time, we are not pursuing declassification,” Eggleston wrote.

Under the act, the Senate torture report will be exempt from the Freedom of Information Act for a full 12 years. But expiration of the provision afterward does not mean that disclosure will necessarily follow.

“CIA or other agencies may contend that all or some of the classified information in the report is still classified 12 years from now,” said Steven Aftergood, an intelligence policy expert at the Federation of American Scientists. After 12 years, a declassification review of the torture report can proceed, “but the review may conclude that the information in it should remain classified”, Aftergood noted.

Through an investigation that lasted more than six years, the Senate intelligence committee found that the CIA’s torture was far more brutal than the agency had told the Bush administration or Congress, and that the agency had lied about the program’s contours and effectiveness. It found unequivocally that torture produced no valuable counter-terrorism intelligence. President-elect Donald Trump has repeatedly expressed a desire to make the CIA engage in torture once again.

Obama came to the aid of the CIA in its dramatic battle with its Senate overseers. The president defended the agency after its operatives surreptitiously spied on the emails and work product of the Senate’s lead investigator, Jones. Through the chief of staff, Denis McDonough, Obama’s White House fought for months throughout 2014 to ensure that the vast majority of the Senate report remained classified and out of public view.

“The administration can, and should, be doing much more,” Jones said.

“They have ignored requests from senators and others to declassify the full report. Worse, while the full 6,700-page classified report was delivered to the CIA, [office of the director of national intelligence], state, FBI, DOJ and DOD; we’re told individuals with the appropriate security clearances at these agencies have not been able to read the report and learn from the mistakes documented. It’s dumbfounding. The administration’s lack of support – and inaction – continues to be incredibly disappointing.”

Despite Obama’s decision, Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat on the intelligence committee and an advocate of the report, pledged to build “a bipartisan coalition” starting next month to declassify the report as a measure to check Trump’s pro-torture impulses.

“The American people deserve the opportunity to read this history rather than see it locked away in a safe for twelve years. When the president-elect has promised to bring back torture, it is also more critical than ever that the study be made available to cleared personnel throughout the federal government who are responsible for authorizing and implementing our country’s detention and interrogation policies,” Wyden said.

Wyden urged Obama to designate the torture report an agency record, which makes it releasable under the Freedom of Information Act, adding: “Burying the study achieves nothing but to create an information vacuum that gets filled with uninformed and highly dangerous propaganda.”

When the high court ruled on the use of the royal prerogative in relation to triggering article 50 we saw an unprecedented attack on the judiciary. Independent judges were labelled “enemies of the people” by the Daily Mail, and publicly lambasted for simply doing their job.

It is the duty of judges to impartially interpret the law, and it is the duty of the lord chancellor, Liz Truss, to unequivocally defend the law. As the supreme court ruling on the use of the royal prerogative approaches, we hope the lord chancellor will not be so shy this time around to vocally defend the independent judiciary.

The people of the UK voted to leave the EU, and this process must be carried out with integrity. Crucially, in exiting the EU we must not undermine our existing democratic structures, or inadvertently weaken the checks and balances on government.

An independent and transparent judiciary is a cornerstone of our democracy, acting as an essential check on power – in this case the very matter at hand is where decision-making powers lie. If our judicial system becomes subject to the whims of politicians and those who shout the loudest, we risk constitutional chaos.

The supreme court’s judgment will no doubt be controversial. If the government once again fails to convincingly defend the independent judiciary an alarming precedent will be set, and it will be hard to ignore the damage done to our democracy.

• It is deeply discouraging to see Simon Jenkins (Opinion, 8 December) of all people joining the populist element currently engaged in bashing the judiciary. The supreme court in the Brexit case will not, as he says, be giving a judgment “about the utility of a one-clause bill”. They will be deciding the important constitutional question of whether the executive has the legal power to trigger article 50 or whether the law requires that it be done by parliament by statute. To go on to say that leavers “would be correct” in suspecting that “they are up against a London mafia of bad-loser judges … out to use every trick in the book to cheat the public of its decision” is a calumny. As it happens, whichever way it goes, the decision in this case will have no effect on implementation of Brexit. 

Michael Zander QC

Emeritus professor, LSE

• Simon Jenkins makes the dangerous assertion that Brexiters would be right in suspecting that “they are up against a London mafia of bad loser judges” saying that “What the judges should do instead is turn the case back on parliament”. But that’s exactly what they’ve done. Judges hear the cases brought before them. The government agreed that this was a case the courts should hear. There was no dispute that the court should decide on this tricky point of law. The government then pursued its right of appeal. So the issue is back with the supreme court. This is our system: an independent judiciary reminding parliament how legally to exercise its sovereignty – not telling MPs how to vote, just saying do it legally. It is time that Simon Jenkins, the Mail and the Telegraph realised that vilifying the judges and seeking to undermine judicial independence is a very dangerous step. The UK has a precious reputation for the rule of law and access to justice. We must not abandon that vital protection for all citizens.

• We must not confuse democracy with mob rule. David Cameron’s commitment to enact the referendum verdict was democratic, if reckless, only because he was the prime minister. His decision does not imply that sovereignty has been transferred from the Queen-in-parliament to public opinion. If our present parliament thinks Brexit is against the national interest, it must dump it without hesitation and at the next election the public can vote accordingly, if it is still unpersuaded that parliament was right. Whatever certain journals may wish it to be, that is our democratic system.

Rod Tipple

• After more than 300 years of asserting parliamentary supremacy, the ghost of royal tyranny returns to haunt us. The supreme court considers a royal prerogative to leave (Report, 6 December), but what about when we’ve left?

The element of “repeal” in the misnomered great “repeal” bill will take the form of a Henry VIII clause, named for the king who, with the Statute of Proclamations 1539, made his word have the force of law. The clause will enable government ministers to repeal or amend primary legislation through a secondary act with limited or no further parliamentary scrutiny. Ministers will be handed the axe and given the chance to divorce, or behead our rights based on EU law.

The Statute of Proclamations was repealed with Henry VIII’s death. This country decided that no man, not even a king, should have the power to make, amend or repeal primary legislation without parliament. Now I fear we’ll be haunted by another royal ghost even if the supreme court dismisses the current one.

Joelle Grogan

Department of Law, Middlesex University

• You say the “urgent job” is to press for a soft Brexit, but that implies premature defeatism about the possibility of averting Brexit altogether, a challenging but still not impossible task (Editorial, 3 December). The demand for parliament or the electorate to have the final say on any agreement with the EU27 (the rest of the EU) negotiated after article 50 has been triggered is incompatible with article 50. The government’s summary of its legal case in the supreme court says “an article 50 notification is irrevocable and cannot be given conditionally”. So when the two years for negotiations are up, we’ll be out of the EU, either with an obviously unpalatable agreement, or, if our government or parliament rejects whatever agreement’s on offer, without any agreement at all – the worst possible outcome. There will be no option after the trigger to reject any agreement and remain in the EU under the existing terms.

The choice between hard and soft Brexit will be made for us by the EU27 once article 50 is triggered. The task now is to convince public opinion that on the emerging evidence, mostly unavailable at the time of the referendum, any kind of achievable Brexit will be worse for ordinary working Britons than remaining in the EU and urgently tackling the grievances that led millions to vote to leave. Once Theresa May triggers article 50, it will be too late. We need to do everything possible to ensure that the trigger is postponed long enough for the British people to exercise their democratic right to change their minds and call off Brexit altogether.

Brian Barder

London

• Simon Jenkins is mistaken in stating that “the judges should tell the MPs they caused this mess”. Our problems with the EU have longer, more deeply rooted origins than sloppy work in parliament but we are where we are and now need all the wise counsel we can get. We need it from judges, from businessmen, from social workers, from scientists – in short from the whole of the society that this decision will affect.

To allow such a serious matter to be reduced to a quarrel between the nationalist and the business wings of the Tory party is a grave mistake. That is why it has been so disturbing to see the Labour party flunking its duty as an opposition and not exposing all these questions to consideration.

Brexit could undermine London’s status as a highly profitable international legal centre, according to the Bar Council, which represents barristers in England and Wales.

The warning comes as lawyers seeking to prevent the UK from leaving the single market by upholding the right to remain in the European Economic Area (EEA) formally lodged notice on Monday of a fresh appeal against the government at the high court.

Peter Wilding, the man credited with inventing the term Brexit in 2012, said the group British Influence expected that its claim against the Department for Exiting the European Union could be heard as early as next February.

The Bar Council’s report, The Brexit Papers, is intended to draw the government’s attention to the financial and professional dangers of removing the UK entirely from close relationships with European jurisdictions.

“The reputation of England and Wales as the pre-eminent destination for international dispute resolution will be damaged if appropriate steps are not taken to ensure that the position as to the jurisdiction of the English courts and the enforcement of English judgments are protected,” the Bar Council working party led by Hugh Mercer QC says.

“A great deal of the attractiveness of the UK in general, and London in particular, as a hub for business (particularly financial services) … will be considerably diminished if steps are not taken to ensure an adequate legal framework is put in place to ensure that English judgments and jurisdiction clauses are effectively and efficiently enforced.”



The report refers to cases in which claimants are being advised not to choose English jurisdiction clauses in their contracts where previously they would have been almost an automatic choice. Some cases that would normally be launched in England are being started in other EU jurisdictions due to uncertainty over the ultimate enforceability of English judgments.

The UK legal services market generates £25.7bn a year in revenue and employs 370,000 people. It produced £3.3bn of net export revenue last year.

In the short to medium term Brexit may benefit lawyers whose legal advice is sought in a period of uncertainty, but the long-term prospects are not as good. 



“The enduring international appeal of the UK for its legal standing will depend on the ability of UK lawyers to provide legal services, including representation, to clients across the EU and elsewhere,” the Bar Council says.

British Influence, one of whose founders was the Labour peer Peter Mandelson, is launching its legal challenge against the government department headed by David Davis. Lord Mandelson is no longer involved with the group. 



The government and the European commission maintain that the UK will leave the EEA at the moment it leaves the EU. 



Article 127 of the EEA agreement requires contracting parties, which include the UK, to give at least 12 months’ notice before leaving. That suggests a separate departure process from article 50 of the EU treaty, which was disputed in the supreme court.

British Influence pointed to the European Economic Area Act 1993, which enshrines the EEA in UK domestic law.

“We note that the Conservative party general election manifesto of 2015 commits to keeping Britain in the single market,” British Influence said. “Just as the Conservative party promised to hold a referendum and honour the result, then, it also effectively promised to keep us in the single market. Leaving the EU is compatible with remaining in the single market.”

Peter Wilding said: “This is not stopping Brexit, this is shaping it. The country demands a win-win, smart Brexit, not a lose-lose ideological hard Brexit which will damage the UK, damage Europe and for which there is no need and no mandate. 



“I support the article 127 campaign because we need to lead, not leave, the common market, which the UK founded. Continued membership of the common market was a Conservative manifesto promise, respects the referendum red lines and avoids the cliff edge which British business fears. So staying in the single market helps not hinders the government.”

Responding to the latest legal threat, a government spokesman said: “The UK is party to the EEA agreement only in its capacity as an EU member state. Once the UK leaves the EU, the EEA agreement will automatically cease to apply to the UK.”

More than 800 magistrates have resigned in England and Wales since April, prompting warnings that the voluntary court service is facing a crisis in morale.

Figures released in a written parliamentary answer revealed that 842 magistrates have left the bench since the beginning of the financial year; a further 952 stood down during the year 2015-16.

Since April 2010, there have been a total of 8,253 resignations, the justice minister Sir Oliver Heald said. 



Court closures, falling crime rates and a relative increase in the number of full-time district judges have all been blamed for the decline. Over the past decade the number of unpaid justices of the peace has dropped from 30,000 in 2006 to 17,500 today.

Commenting on the accelerating rate of departures, Malcolm Richardson, national chairman of the Magistrates’ Association, the independent charity that represent JPs in England and Wales, said: “With approximately 95% of all criminal cases dealt with by magistrates, it’s worrying that resignations have reached this level. 



“Like any role in unpaid public service, magistrates leave the bench for a variety of reasons, yet budget cuts, court closures and a sense of being under-valued are frequently cited as reasons for going.

“Considering the magistracy is the central pillar of criminal justice in England and Wales we urge the government to work with us to solve the problem. The system is not in crisis, as some claim, but if the causes for resignations are not dealt with it may well be in the near future.”

In the written answer, Heald said: “This government values the judiciary greatly. A strong, independent judiciary is essential for a modern, democratic society and we do not take for granted the central role judges play in upholding the rule of law and delivering justice. Our judges and magistrates are rightly held in high regard around the world. Magistrate remains a sought after role and competition for vacancies tends to be strong.”

Around 250 magistrates courts, youth courts and county courts have closed since 2010 as part of a coordinated cost-cutting drive. The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) argues that 95% of defendants should be able to reach their local court within an hour by car. Keeping to the speed limit, that implies many will be up to 70 miles away.

The Conservative MP Bob Neill, who chairs the justice select committee, said in October: “It is unfortunate that the government’s evident goodwill towards the magistracy has not yet been translated into any meaningful strategy for supporting and developing it within a changing criminal justice system. This needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency.

“Although evidence does not indicate a universal problem, there is sufficient evidence of low morale within the magistracy to cause concern.”

Earlier this month an MoJ spokesperson said: “Closing underused and dilapidated court buildings will allow us to reinvest in the justice system and make the best use of technology. This will improve access to justice and improve the experience for all court users, in particular vulnerable victims and witnesses.”

A British couple have won a legal fight to be reunited with their children after being arrested on suspicion of trying to travel to Syria to join Islamic State.

The couple, from the north-east of England, were arrested at the Eurotunnel terminal at Folkestone on 10 July 2015 on suspicion of preparing terrorist acts and child cruelty or neglect. Their teenage son and two younger children were in the back of the car and later told police they did not know where they had been going.

The parents always insisted they were going on a surprise weekend away in the German Alps, where they planned to hike and “taste the local pastries”. No evidence was ever found that they had made any direct communication with anyone living in Syria or in Isis-controlled territories.

When told that police thought the family were heading to Syria, the teenager reportedly said: “Oh my days, I never thought that my dad would really go to Syria or Morocco or somewhere like that.”

The three children were placed in foster care for four months but were returned to their parents in November 2015.

A high court judge has now ruled they can stay together as a family, along with their new baby sibling.

Mr Justice Cobb said he was not convinced the family had been going for a weekend away in Germany, but he believed the attitudes of the parents had “genuinely changed” after they took part in an extensive deradicalisation programme.

Suspicions about the family were raised four months before their arrest at Folkestone, when the father posted a picture on Facebook of a man with whom he had been in an altercation, calling him an “apostate”.

He was arrested on suspicion of publishing threatening written material intending to stir up religious hatred.

The family home was searched and a number of electronic devices were seized. Analysis of videos, documents and social media communications aroused concern that the parents supported forms of Islamic extremism, terrorism and jihadi activity, and that they had associations with proscribed terrorist organisations with connections in Syria and Iraq.

Among the material found was a picture of a woman and children being hanged over a bridge, a video of a captured Jordanian pilot being executed, and The Book of Jihad by Abi Zakaryya.

The father was a member of a WhatsApp group that included various suspected terrorists and criminals, and on which he praised the actions of a leading al-Qaida figure who was allegedly responsible for several terrorist attacks, dispatching suicide bombers, and the beheading of hostages.

The father was interviewed by police but he offered no comment. The police formed the view that the father was associated or connected with al-Muhajiroun, a proscribed organisation.

The father denied this and told police he had been researching the attitudes of those who espoused radical or extreme Islamic views. He was never charged with any terror offence.

The mother had retweeted messages from a well-known Islamic extremist preacher as well as pictures of men in orange boiler suits being prepared for death, under the banner: “This is the recompense for every spy helping to kill innocent Muslims #Isis #IS”.

In his fact-finding ruling, Cobb said the parents’ claim that they had been going for a weekend away was “wholly unconvincing”, partly because of their behaviour en route and also because of how much they had packed.

Shortly before reaching the Eurotunnel terminal, the parents pulled into a supermarket car park off the motorway to change out of their traditional Muslim clothing. The mother removed her abaya and niqab, and the father changed his T-shirt and shaved off his long beard.

The mother had not been without a scarf or hijab since she was 16; she said she had never known the father without a beard. The father had been to Germany at least four times in the previous 15 years, and on no previous occasion had he shaved his beard, the judge said.

In the back of the car was “a substantial quantity of clothes for all seasons”, despite the alleged holiday taking place in mid-summer, plus 17 pairs of male boxer shorts, more than 40 pairs of socks, approximately 30 pairs of knickers, 17 baby-grows, a black balaclava, 112 sanitary towels, multiple razors, refills and shavers, sun creams and deodorants as well as several sim cards.

The parents were carrying £3,000 in cash, £2,000 of which the father had raised in the weeks before the trip by selling items on eBay, many of which he didn’t appear to own and none of which he ever sent to the purchasers.

Before leaving their home they gave away their family pet.

Concluding his judgment, Cobb acknowledged “a risk that the parents have simply complied superficially” with the deradicalisation programme and that “once the proceedings are over and the glare of social work interest has faded, they will revert to their previous views and behaviours”.

But he said: “There is now good evidence that the parents reject their previous ideological beliefs, which they now acknowledge to have been extreme and unorthodox; there is no evidence that they have in any sense indoctrinated [the two older children, who] have a much more resilient attitude to extreme ideology than previously.”

The last three Conservative lord chancellors have been blamed for “bringing the custodial system to the brink of collapse” by the former head of the prison and probation services in England and Wales.

Writing for the Guardian Phil Wheatley, the former chief executive of the National Offender Management Service and director general of the prison service, said it would “take years to put right” but the role of successive Conservative justice secretaries needed to be openly acknowledged and understood “if there is to be any chance of recovering from the current disaster”.

Wheatley explicitly blamed Ken Clarke, Chris Grayling and Michael Gove for bringing the custodial system to a state of “operational disaster” as a direct result of deep budget cuts and wild swings in government policy.

“This current crisis is a failure of major proportions for the government. Managing prisons is a difficult and highly skilled task that requires adequate resourcing and a stable policy environment. Since 2010 the government has failed on both counts,” he wrote.

He said the current lord chancellor, Elizabeth Truss, deserved credit for quickly recognising that prison staffing levels were too low to maintain safety or security, managing to secure Treasury backing to partially reverse jail staffing cuts by recruiting an extra 2,500 prison officers, and launching a prison safety reform programme.

The unprecedented intervention by Wheatley, who retired in 2010 and was succeeded by Michael Spurr, highlights deep concern that the prison crisis will not easily be put right – with dire consequences for prisoners, staff and the public.

He said when the coalition came to power in 2010, prisons were already dangerously overcrowded “despite advice on the risks, making it necessary for me to refuse outright to comply with their wishes”. He retired and his successor has had to deal with the bigger challenge of cuts to an unprotected budget compounded by “successive lord chancellors introducing their own radically different policies for prisons”.

Wheatley said Clarke, the first coalition lord chancellor, accepted deep budget cuts for the justice ministry on the basis he could reduce the prison population and put public sector prisons out to tender. But two years later David Cameron removed him for not being seen to be tough on prisoners.

Grayling followed with a brief to be a tough justice secretary without cutting jail numbers and no extra funding. Grayling abandoned the prison competition plans and instead announced his own reform programme across prison and probation. Wheatley said Grayling’s plans “threatened the stability and safety of prisons” but were considered essential to deliver the funding cuts without attracting tabloid criticism in the run-up to the 2015 general election.

According to Wheatley, Gove, the third Conservative lord chancellor, “charmed penal reformers by rubbishing most” of Grayling’s policies. But when Gove proposed his own reform vision of more liberal treatment of prisoners and individual freedom for governors, he ignored the predicament prisons were actually in. A third reorganisation of the NOMS in five years was ordered.

“Gove was, of course, gone before he had to take responsibility for the disruption caused both by his abandonment of Grayling’s policies and his abject failure to engage with their consequences,” said Wheatley.

He said the “operational disaster” that Truss inherited was a result of the continued budget reductions and swings in government policy. He said the result has been the loss of experienced prison managers and staff, too few prison officers of any sort, wages that make it difficult to recruit and retain staff, and cuts in prisoner programmes.

“The situation is now so parlous and will only be resolved by a prolonged period of policy stability and investment. It will take years to put right,” Wheatley wrote. He said the current leaders of the prison service had struggled to deliver what was required of them by politicians who, in turn, had been told what risks they were running.

“The responsibility of ministers in bringing our custodial system to the brink of collapse needs to be understood and openly acknowledged if there is to be any chance of recovering from the current disaster,” he warned.

The current crisis in our prisons is a matter of deep concern. It is an indictment of government policy in recent years, and will not be easily put right. It is vital that politicians understand and address what led us here if it is to be repaired. Without that, the crisis will deepen – with inevitable and dire consequences for prisoners, staff and the public.

I retired as chief executive of the National Offender Management Service (Noms) and director general of the Prison Service in June 2010, at which point the service was performing strongly. Suicides, escapes and serious incidents of disorder were at an all-time low, and the published statistics showed there had been more than 10% improvement in reoffending since 2000.

This was achieved despite the distraction of significant organisational upheavals initiated by ministers as they created and then reformed the National Offender Management Service.

The government’s unwillingness to fund the increases in the prison population that were driven by their obsession with pursuing populist law and order policies also caused problems. Ministers saw no problem with overcrowding to dangerous levels despite advice on the risks, making it necessary for me to refuse outright to comply with their wishes.

My successor, Michael Spurr, has faced even bigger challenges as a consequence of the severe budget reductions. This has been compounded by successive Conservative lord chancellors introducing their own radically different policies for prisons. Ken Clarke, the first lord chancellor in the coalition government, accepted a budget for justice that required substantial savings. He did so on the basis that it would be manageable if he both reduced the prison population and competitively tendered all public sector prisons over the lifetime of the government.

Just over two years later, David Cameron removed Clarke after political and tabloid press criticism of his proposals to reduce the prison population and his apparent unwillingness to be tough on prisoners.

Chris Grayling came next, with a brief to toughen up prison conditions without reducing the numbers and with no additional funding. The competitive tendering process was immediately abandoned. In its place, Grayling announced a programme of significant reforms across the prison and probation service.

The plans threatened the stability and safety of prisons but they were essential to meet the short-term political objective of managing within the planned budget while not reducing the prison population and not attracting tabloid criticism in the run-up to the 2015 election. It is a tribute to the skill of the Noms leadership and management that it delivered what Grayling required.

He was succeeded by Michael Gove, who charmed penal reformers by rubbishing most of his predecessor’s policies and making clear he had no taste for firm, centralised management. Ignoring the predicament prisons were in, Gove’s seductive policy vision was of liberal treatment for prisoners and freedom for individual governors to do their own thing.

Yet another major reorganisation of Noms was required: the third such upheaval in five years. Gove, of course, was gone before he had to take responsibility for the disruption caused both by his abandonment of Grayling’s policies and his abject failure to engage with their consequences.

Liz Truss now has the misfortune to inherit the operational disaster that is the direct result of these continued budget reductions and wild swings in government policy. The policies pursued by her predecessors have led to the loss of experienced prison managers and staff, too few prison officers of any sort, wages that make it difficult to recruit and retain staff, and a reduction in privileges and access to treatment interventions and regime activities that have been corrosive for prisoners. The situation is now parlous and will only be resolved by a prolonged period of policy stability and investment. It will take years to put right.

It is to Truss’s credit that she has quickly recognised that prison staffing levels are too low to maintain safety or security. It remains to be seen whether she also understands that prisons work best when they are not subjected to fluctuating political whims and have strong, effective management.

So far she has proposed league tables, more budgetary freedom for prison governors and accountability for hitting agreed performance targets, all of which is sensible and marks a return to the system we operated prior to 2010.

The organisational changes she is making are less encouraging. The process of recovery from the current crisis will require effective support services geared to meet the operational needs of prisons so that personnel, finance and procurement are integral to the management effort to resolve the problems faced. The minister however has transferred control of these services to the Ministry of Justice, so they will be managed by staff who have no experience of the operational challenges faced by prisons. It is highly likely that this will hamper the recovery effort.

There are no quick fixes that will easily rebuild the morale and confidence of staff. It is essential that ministers now refrain from whizzy political initiatives, and create a period of organisational and policy stability. This will allow the very competent managers of our prisons to concentrate on the core business of restoring order and constructive activity in our prisons.

This current crisis is a failure of major proportions for the government. Managing prisons is a difficult and highly skilled task that requires adequate resourcing, and a stable policy environment.

In the period since May 2010 the government has failed on both counts. The current leaders and managers of the Prison Service have struggled to deliver what has been required of them by politicians who have been told what risks they were running. The responsibility of ministers in bringing our custodial system to the brink of collapse needs to be understood and openly acknowledged if there is to be any chance of recovering from the current disaster.

Three animal charities are fighting to preserve almost £500,000 left to them by a woman, who cut her estranged daughter out of her will, in a test case being heard at the supreme court on Monday.

The protracted dispute over Melita Jackson’s inheritance has made its way through the English courts since her death, at 70, in 2004.

The final judgment, which is not expected until next year, will decide whether it is reasonable for parents to leave their wealth to charities if they fail to make adequate provision for their offspring.

Jackson’s only child, Heather Ilott, was rejected by her mother at 17 after she left home in 1978 to live with her boyfriend, Nicholas Ilott, whom she later married. 



Attempts at reconciliation failed, and when Jackson died 12 years ago her will made no provision for her daughter, by then a mother of five, who has no pension and was on state benefits.

Most of the £486,000 estate was left to the Blue Cross, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. 



In 2007, the county court awarded Ilott £50,000 on the grounds that her mother had acted in an “unreasonable, capricious and harsh” way towards her.

Ilott, from Great Munden, Hertfordshire, challenged the award. In 2011, the court of appeal decided that sum was insufficient. Judges then warned that further costly litigation would eat into the value of the estate. 



Last year the court of appeal ruled that Ilott should receive £164,000.

Ilott, who is in her 50s, made an application under the Inheritance (Provision for Family and Dependants) Act 1975 for “reasonable financial provision” from her mother’s estate.

The act confers the right on a child of a deceased parent to apply for an order if a will does not make reasonable provision for their maintenance. 



The delays are reminiscent of the disputed will of Jarndyce v Jarndyce in Charles Dickens’ novel Bleak House.

In the latest hearing, the charities are seeking clarification of the rules under the 1975 act. It is being heard by a panel of seven supreme court justices, headed by Lord Neuberger. Judgment will be reserved.

The three charities said they had pursued their claim in order to “affirm the importance of testamentary freedom and secure crucial guidance for the future”. 



In a statement they explained: “The charities have appealed this decision in order to obtain essential clarity from the Supreme Court regarding the scope of the court’s power to interfere with a person’s testamentary wishes using the 1975 Act.”

Paula Myers, head of the will trust and estate disputes team at the law firm Irwin Mitchell, said of the court of appeal decision: “The ruling potentially made it easier for adult children who have been left out of wills to challenge them if they have not been left a reasonable provision and we have seen a rise in inquiries from people who feel that they have been unfairly disinherited.”

Geoffrey Kertesz, partner and head of will and trust disputes at Bircham Dyson Bell, said: “The court of appeal made its decision on narrow grounds and seemed principally concerned with providing Mrs Ilott, who is in straitened financial circumstances, with housing in a manner that preserved her state benefits. 



“The larger, practical implication of the decision is that, irrespective of the relationship between a parent and estranged child, it has become significantly more difficult to disinherit a child.

“The case seems to have created an ‘Ilott effect’, as we are seeing an increase in Inheritance Act claims brought by adult children and against charitable beneficiaries. Unless the supreme court overturns the decision, claims of this nature will only become more common.”

The Crimean peninsula, annexed by Russia in 2014, has swiftly degenerated into the scene of the greatest repression being conducted anywhere in the entire country.

The targets of the Kremlin’s crackdown are the Crimean Tatars, the ethnic group that originally formed the Crimean nation on the Black Sea peninsula. Between the 13th and 18th centuries the Tatars enjoyed their own state, and since 2014 they have been campaigning to return their homeland to Ukrainian rule. For this they have become the collective enemy of Russia.

They are now victims of hate and persecution, and not for the first time in their tragic history. In May 1944, Joseph Stalin ordered the mass resettlement of Tatars, after accusing them of collaborating with the Nazis. At the time they made up about a fifth of the total population of the Crimeanpeninsula. More than 230,000 people, including almost the entire Crimean Tatar population, were deported, mostly to Uzbekistan.

Those who survived the deportation were only allowed to return after perestroika 45 years later. Even then, communist authorities gave them a hostile reception.

But after 25 years in independent Ukraine, the Tatars had rebuilt their communities from scratch. They formed the only nation in the former Soviet Union with its own democratic governing body, the mejlis, with no help from the state.

Thanks to this elected body and its long-time head, , a Soviet-era dissident, Crimean Tatars became semi-autonomous within Ukraine, while supporting the country’s pro-European leanings.

In 2014, the Tatars boycotted the sham and illegal referendum organised by Russia. The Kremlin hailed the result as a “vote” for Crimea to join the Russian Federation. This dissent kickstarted a new and brutal phase of Tatar oppression.

Today, less than 300,000 people – below 15% of the peninsula’s population – is Tatar. In the two years since annexation more than 21,000 Tatars have left because of an intensifying atmosphere of hatred and repression, and the exodus shows no signs of slowing.

The nature of this repression is highlighted by the fact that more than 90% of those in prison in the region are accused of political crimes. A large majority of those declared missing since the annexation are from the Tatar community.

Mejlis leaders such as Dzhemilev and Refat Chubarov, alongside other public figures and journalists of Tatar origin, have been forced to leave Crimea, prohibited from visiting their homeland by Russia.

The first signs of the crackdown started in 2014, when Tatars were forbidden from holding mass gatherings, even on 18 May, the official day for commemorating the 1944 deportations.

In spring 2015, the Russian authorities banned Tatar TV channels and press outlets. ATR, the Crimean Tatar TV channel, was closed down, as well as the radio station Meydan FM and even a children’s TV channel, Lale.

Since then, the situation has become increasingly dangerous, to the point that parents now accompany their children to school for fear of abduction. Young Tatar are even told not to wear clothes with ethnic elements. Last year, Nariman Jelyalov, the deputy president of the mejlis, published a personal safety manual, recommending Tatars only move around in groups in well-lit public places.

In order to maintain the atmosphere of fear among Tatars, Russian security forces – complete with dogs and armed masked men – have been conducting regular raids. People are fined, arrested and put on trial en masse for anything that reminds the Russian authorities of the existence of Crimean Tatars, from national flags to supposedly banned literature.

Last month, the entire system of Crimean Tatar self-rule, comprising more than 2,000 elected delegates, was declared to be an extremist organisation by the supreme court of Russia, and participating members are now being threatened with incarceration for taking part in “illegal gatherings”.



For his support for the territorial integrity of his country, Akhtem Chiygoz, the deputy chairman of the mejlis, has been in prison for 18 months, while Ilmi Umerov, a former head of the Bakhchisarai district administration, the ancient capital of the Crimean Tatars, was put in a psychiatric ward for a humiliating psychiatric examination. He was eventually found sane.

There are now more than 20 Crimean Tatars in Russian prisons, and the number is steadily increasing. Others have faced kidnap, and even death. The most infamous abduction in Crimea happened in May, when a group of people in military uniforms abducted Ervin Ibragimov, one of the leaders of the World Congress of Crimean Tatars, in front of CCTV cameras. His fate is unknown. Many in the Tatar community presume he is dead.

There are no barbed-wire fences in this new hybrid ghetto of Vladimir Putin’s – yet. Instead of wire there is hate-filled TV propaganda, total surveillance and constant harassment.

The Tatars have been picked for the outcast role. Russian authorities in Crimea are busy erecting monuments to the persecutors of the Tatars: Stalin and Catherine the Great. Crimean Tatars are afraid to speak to journalists and human rights activists – and to each other. Meanwhile, their neighbours are busy writing reports to the authorities and want to know when the Tatars will get the hell out of “our Russian Crimea”.

Crimean Tatars are banned from speaking their native language at work. If they use it outside their own areas people insult them. Parents from Russian and other non-Tatar families prefer to limit their and their children’s contacts with Crimean Tatars.

There is a tradition in “Russian Crimea”: military helicopters circle low above homes during raids carried out on dates that mark tragic events in Crimean Tatar history. They do it for no apparent reasons – just to make the windows shake.

I do not know how many people in Crimea must be killed, driven out and deprived of human dignity before a world that once conquered fascism stands up and defends Crimean Tatars. The international community could, for example, introduce special sanctions to punish Russia for bringing Nazi practices back to Europe.

I know that until that is done, the situation will become catastrophically worse. And in years to come, many will feel ashamed for staying silent today.

Amazon has been accused of creating “intolerable working conditions” after allegations that workers have been penalised for sick days and that some are camping near one of its warehouses to save money commuting to work.

Willie Rennie, the Liberal Democrat leader in Scotland, said Amazon should be “ashamed” that workers at its warehouse in Dunfermline have chosen to camp outside in the winter.

He made the comments after the the Courier newspaper published photographs of tents near the site that it said were being lived in by Amazon workers. It said at least three tents were pitched close to the warehouse by the M90 in Dunfermline and that a man living in one of them had said he was an employee who usually lives in Perth.

A Sunday Times investigation found that temporary workers at the warehouse were being penalised for taking time off sick and put under pressure to hit targets for picking orders. It also claimed that although workers could walk up to 10 miles a day doing their jobs, water dispensers were regularly empty.

Amazon has hired 20,000 agency workers for the peak Christmas season, more than doubling its workforce. Staff have to pay to catch an agency-provided bus to the Dunfermline site.

Rennie has repeatedly called for the firm to improve conditions at its Dunfermline site and said the latest claim “chimes with the feedback I have received from local people over a long period of time”.

He said: “It confirms that Amazon have created intolerable working conditions for many. The company don’t seem to be interested in keeping workers for too long as they work them until they drop. They have generated an oppressive culture where management and some workers put undue pressure on workers.

“It’s time for Amazon to finally change their ways. That means a change to wages and to working conditions.”



Rennie said the firm should be “ashamed that they pay their workers so little that they have to camp out in the dead of winter to make ends meet”.

Amazon, which has 12 fulfilment centres around the UK, has come under fire in the past for its treatment of workers, many of whom are employed through agencies. Three years ago, an undercover reporter for the Observer wrote about the long hours and physical work carried out for low pay, while more recently unions have claimed that workers are falling ill as a result.

Online job forums have reviews by former workers which describe being expected to “work like robots” and “paranoia with job security”. Workers say overtime is compulsory and holidays banned in the busy months of November and December.

When questioned about the tents, Amazon said it “provides a safe and positive workplace with competitive pay and benefits from day one”.

It added: “We are proud to have been able to create several thousand new permanent roles in our UK fulfilment centres over the last five years. One of the reasons we’ve been able to attract so many people to join us is that we offer great jobs and a positive work environment with opportunities for growth.

“We offer associates a range of roles in our fulfilment centres, depending on their preferences. Some roles involve walking a number of miles each day, a fact we make clear during the recruitment process. Many associates seek these positions as they enjoy the active nature of the work. There are many opportunities for people who prefer less active roles.

“As with nearly all companies, we expect a certain level of performance from our associates. Productivity targets are set objectively, based on previous performance levels achieved by our workforce.”

The company said it analysed wages every year to ensure they were competitive. All permanent and temporary Amazon workers start on £7.35 an hour or more and earn at least £11 an hour for overtime. There are paid 30-minute lunch breaks and subsidised meals. The new national living wage is £7.20 for workers aged over 25.

Water is readily available for staff as they performed their duties, Amazon said, and it has a “fair and predictable system to record staff attendance and take into account individual circumstances”.



Michael Newman, an employment lawyer at Leigh Day, said that it was legal for companies to have a policy which meant that workers were effectively penalised if they were off sick. “Absence policies are definitely becoming stricter – one example would be having a bonus or ‘attendance allowance’ that is then forfeited if the worker is off sick,” he said.

“Amazon’s policy doesn’t seem particularly unusual though – the important thing is to distinguish between days off, and periods of absence. It is usually the latter that counts for unfair dismissal purposes, although many policies look at both how long you are off for, and how many times you are off.”



The Labour MP Frank Field, who has been campaigning against poor conditions for self-employed workers, said the government-ordered review into working practices should issue an interim report.

“Inquiries take time but over that time the injustices are growing,” he said. “There have been reports on Hermes and Uber done by my office, and now the Sunday Times investigation – there is enough information out there.”

A British-Algerian journalist has died after staging a hunger strike in protest against a two-year jail term for offending Algeria’s president in a poem posted online, according to his lawyer.

“I can confirm the death of the journalist Mohamed Tamalt in Bab el-Oued hospital after a hunger strike of more than three months and a three-month coma,” Amine Sidhoum said on Facebook.

The prison service said in a statement Tamalt had died of a lung infection for which he was receiving treatment since it was detected on 4 December. He had been in hospital since the end of August. Tamalt, a dual national, launched the hunger strike on the day of his arrest near his parents’ house in the capital Algiers on 27 June, according to Human Rights Watch.

The 42-year-old blogger and freelance journalist, who ran a website from London where he lived, was charged with offending President Abdelaziz Bouteflika and defaming a public authority, in the poem he shared on Facebook. A court in Algiers sentenced him to two years in prison on 11 July and fined him 200,000 dinars (£1,400). An appeals court upheld the ruling a month later.

Amnesty International urged Algerian authorities on Sunday to open an “independent and transparent investigation into the circumstances” of the journalist’s death.

Media watchdog Reporters Without Borders (RSF) said it was shocked by Tamalt’s death which had dealt a blow to freedom of information in Algeria. “Why was there such a conviction just for words on Facebook which did no harm to anyone?” said Yasmine Kacha, head of the north Africa department of RSF.

HRW had urged Algerian authorities to release him in August when he was reportedly in critical condition. “The Algerian authorities should quash the case against Tamalt and send the message that free speech will be respected in Algeria,” it said at the time.

UK businesses will have to deal with 60m more pieces of paperwork each year if Britain leaves the customs union as it departs the EU, according to research from a group campaigning to keep trade links with the bloc after Brexit.

According to Open Britain, a hard Brexit could spark an “avalanche of paperwork” if thousands of importing and exporting businesses were forced to fill out similar forms to those required in moving goods and services beyond the union.

The claim comes as the government faces another potential legal challenge to its Brexit plans, this time from two campaigners who are seeking a judicial review in the high court to keep Britain in the single market.

Under the EU customs union, which deals with rules relating to trade, unified tariffs are levied on imports to the whole area, meaning no new charges or associated paperwork are needed for goods shipped between members.

According to Open Britain, which has support from remain MPs in the three main Westminster parties, customs data shows that last year the UK made 70.5m import declarations and 6.5m export declarations over trade in non-EU goods.



The group says that if leaving the customs union involved a similar level of customs paperwork, it would require businesses to complete more than 45m import declarations and 15m export declarations every year.

This contradicts the arguments of pro-Brexit campaigners made before the June referendum, namely that leaving the EU would save businesses from EU-related bureaucracy, said the Labour MP Chris Leslie, who backs the group.

“Brexit isn’t a liberation from red tape but the beginning of an avalanche of paperwork for businesses trading with Europe,” he said. “Ministers should commit to publishing a full cost-benefit analysis of the consequences of leaving the customs union, rather than just airily asserting that it will benefit our trade and our economy without any evidence for those claims.”

Jo Carberry, of Open Britain, said leaving the customs union would result in “a bombshell of Brexit bureaucracy for British businesses”.

Meanwhile, membership of the single market, the EU’s wider agreement on free trade as well as the movement of people, services and money, could now be argued in the high court, the Sunday Times has reported.

As the supreme court considers the article 50 legal challenge, a new case hinges on whether the government would have to trigger another legal measure to quit the single market.



Claimants in the new case argue that the government has no mandate to withdraw from the single market because it was not on the ballot paper on 23 June and was not included in the Conservative party manifesto for last year’s general election. They argue that the government would have to trigger article 127 of the European Economic Area agreement.

However, the former attorney general Dominic Grieve – one of Open Britain’s supporters in parliament – cast doubts on the legal basis for the new challenge.



“It’s possible that the argument is that the way we leave the single market has to be separate from leaving the EU itself,” he said, speaking on Sky News’ Murnaghan programme on Sunday. “I have some doubts as to whether that would work.”

Asked if the article 50 challenge was simply “the first legal spanner” in the government’s plans and other legal challenges would follow, Grieve said there was “undoubtedly a very large number of legal complexities”. He added: “It’s going to be complicated; it’s 50 years of enmeshed legal obligations and rights.”

The new case comes after it emerged that another legal challenge to Brexit will go ahead in Ireland after crowdfunding hit a £75,000 target within 48 hours. Specialist tax barrister Jolyon Maugham said he was bringing the case to address two issues: whether a notification under article 50 can be revoked and whether Britain would automatically leave the EEA when it left the EU.

Maugham argues that the European council and the European commission may have breached EU law on the grounds that if article 50 cannot be revoked then the government will be forced to accept whatever Brexit deal the EU offers. As an EU nation needs to be named in the legal action, the case will be heard in Ireland’s high court but is likely to be referred to European courts.

The single market court challenge is being brought by remain voter Peter Wilding, chairman of pressure group British Influence, and Adrian Yalland, a Conservative lobbyist who voted to leave.

They have informed Downing Street of their intention to seek the judicial review. Wilding said: “This is not stopping Brexit, this is shaping it. The country demands a win-win, smart Brexit; not a lose-lose ideological hard Brexit which will damage the UK, damage Europe and for which there is no need and no mandate.”

The supreme court spent four days last week hearing arguments over whether the government’s prerogative powers are sufficient to trigger article 50, or if this needs approval from parliament.

A judgment in the case is expected in early January. The government was granted an early appeal direct to the supreme court after the high court ruled last month that it was up to parliament to launch the formal process of exiting the EU.

That decision prompted much angry comment from some newspapers and Conservative MPs that the courts were trying to overturn the decision of the Brexit referendum in June.

However, those behind the article 50 case insist they are simply seeking to ensure that the process happens in accordance with constitutional protocols.

Helen Mountfield QC, representing the crowdfunded People’s Challenge group at the supreme court, said on Thursday that the government was as good as making up the perceived scope of its prerogative powers as it went along.

“It’s much like attempts to catch the Loch Ness monster,” she said. “Because no one has caught it, it is said to be assumed to still roam free.”

The case was not an attempt to “persuade the court to undertake judicial law-making”, she added.

Edward Snowden has been the subject of several high-profile appeals this year, calling on Barack Obama to pardon the National Security Agency whistleblower and allow him to return home to the US. Writers, intelligence experts, film stars and tech tycoons have all joined the chorus.



Now the most audacious display of support for Snowden is under way. Messages calling for his pardon are being beamed on to the outside wall of the Newseum, the Washington institution devoted to freedom of speech and the press that stands less than two miles from the White House.

The event is a guerrilla action carried out without the knowledge or approval of the Newseum itself, though the organisers of the stunt from the Pardon Snowden campaign are hoping they will be given a sympathetic reception.

“We sincerely hope that the Newseum supports what we are doing as an affirmation of the significance of a free press,” Noa Yachot, the campaign’s director, told the Guardian before the event.

Almost 4,000 messages backing Snowden’s decision to expose mass government surveillance of emails and phone calls have been gathered by the campaign, from across the US and around the world.

The messages include this one, from Casey: “I’m a 69-year-old vet and applaud your guts, we owe you lots and let’s hope you can come home to your family and friends.”

And this, from Tess: “Ed, I’m on your side. You’re a hero and an example of what it means to be an American. Thank you for making such an incredible sacrifice in order that we might move a bit more toward the truth.”

Frank offers: “True patriotism: speaking up when your government loses its moral compass.”

The messages are being projected onto the 74ft-high marble tablet that is attached to the facade of the Newseum and which has the words of the first amendment carved into it.

Written in 1791 as part of the bill of rights, it states: “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.”

Saturday night’s action in Washington comes at a critical time for Snowden, who remains in exile in Russia where he has been granted asylum, having been charged in the US with offences under the Espionage Act.

Obama has less than six weeks left in office, meaning that if he is to use his power to pardon the whistleblower or extend some other form of leniency that would allow him to come home, he has to do so quickly.

Obama’s successor, President-elect Donald Trump, has hinted that he would sooner see Snowden executed than pardoned.

Yachot said the Newseum had been chosen as the location of the guerrilla action as a way of highlighting Snowden’s careful and responsible use of global news organisations as a way of disseminating his leaks.

“Snowden’s work with journalists, including the Guardian, enabled the release of information into the public domain,” she said. “It showed that we need a strong and adversarial media, working with whistleblowers, to inform the public about what the government is doing without anyone’s knowledge.”

Yachot added that though time was running out, history suggested that US presidents often reserved their most contentious pardons until the last minute.

“There are only six weeks left,” she said, “but we know that controversial pardons often come at the end of a president’s term, so we are still hoping.”

Threatening to disclose intimate images would become a criminal offence under amendments to the policing and crime bill to be tabled by the Liberal Democrats.

The clause will also criminalise individuals who disclose revenge porn images in a “reckless” manner, in a bid to prevent perpetrators escaping prosecution because it cannot be proved that the images or video were shared in a malicious way.

The Lib Dem amendments also advocate giving victims of revenge porn the right to anonymity. The move would bring revenge porn – the disclosing of private sexual photographs or video without the consent of the individual and with intent to cause distress – into line with other laws on sexual offences.

Lack of anonymity may act as a disincentive for victims to come forward, as media coverage in court cases can lead to embarrassment or humiliation.

Brian Paddick, Lib Dem shadow home secretary and a former Metropolitan Police senior officer, said: “Revenge porn is a horrific crime that has an appalling impact on victims. Victims should be given anonymity just like all other victims of sexual offences and the threat of disclosing intimate images must also be criminalised, as is the case in Scotland.

“These are commonsense measures that work for victims and will encourage victims to come forward and seek justice. I hope the government and Labour will support us and stand up for those who at the moment are suffering in silence.”

The policing and crime bill is at the report stage and will be debated in the Lords this week. Revenge porn, which carries a jail term of up to two years and a fine, became a criminal offence in England and Wales in April 2015 following a series of high-profile cases that raised awareness of the issue. Prominent victims of revenge porn include Paris Hilton and Tulisa Contostavlos.There were 1,160 cases reported between April and December 2015 to 31 police forces in England and Wales. Three victims were 11 years old. In 61% of cases no action was taken, with lack of evidence or the victim withdrawing support given as the reason

Our youth justice system should not just be about punishing crime, important though that is; it should also be about reforming offenders. It should provide discipline, purpose, supervision and someone who cares – elements that have all too often been missing from these young lives.

The people in our prisons and young offender institutions have broken the law, they have violated the rules under which a civilised society necessarily and rightly operates, and they must face the consequences. But we are missing an opportunity if we do not recognise that helping these people to turn their lives around not only benefits them but benefits us all, preventing more of us becoming victims of crime; making streets and communities safer. And delivering huge savings to the public purse.

Nowhere is this opportunity greater than with our young people. Because here the penal system has its earliest chance to intervene, to steer our young people away from a life of crime and on to the right path, towards finding a job, settling down with a family.

Today there are fewer than 1,000 children in custody but this small number represents some of the most complex, violent and damaged children within society. I repeat, they have committed some appalling crimes and it is right that the public are protected and justice is done. However, youth custody should be about more than containment where children are exposed to yet more violence and given little hope that things may ever change.

On average it costs £75,000 a year to keep an offender in a young offender institution yet seven out of 10 will commit another crime within a year of release. Centres that deliver containment without purpose all too often lead to young criminals becoming persistent offenders whose only graduation is into adult prison – young anger that turns into an adult’s hardened attitude to others and leaves a trail of devastated victims in its wake.

This is our chance to equip young offenders with the skills they need to lead law-abiding lives. This is why Charlie Taylor’s groundbreaking new report rightly focuses on putting education at the heart of youth custody. He has made a compelling case for change, and the government has listened. So we will establish two new secure schools – giving children the maths, English and practical skills they need to thrive on the outside.

The progress that young offenders make in education, health and behaviour will be measured to show how well establishments are doing in reforming young offenders. A new role will be created to take charge of youth custody, tasked with reducing violence, driving performance and taking action when necessary if centres are failing.

We will be putting an extra £15m into providing 20% more staff to give the children the supervision and support they need – to challenge them to change and to drive reform. And in time we want to see every young person in custody on an apprenticeship or on the path to further or higher education. Every young person who leaves custody should be earning or learning.

Of course, we need to do more – and we will. Intervening early is crucial in reducing youth crime. However, these longer-term changes we need in our system should not stop us taking the urgent action required to transform youth custody from places where young offenders are left to fester into places of discipline and purpose.

Youth custody represents a crossroads for the young offenders within. They have arrived there through a myriad of missed opportunities, a lack of good guidance and too many bad choices. They may be violent, damaged and challenging but they should not leave without hope that there is another way to lead their lives.

It’s not too late to turn the time spent in custody into a turning point for hundreds of young people.

Serious doubts have been cast over the evidence about the Hillsborough disaster given in a statement by the former Premier League chairman, Sir Dave Richards, which included a notorious allegation against some Liverpool supporters.

Trevor Hicks, whose two teenage daughters, Sarah and Vicki, were among the 96 people unlawfully killed at the 1989 FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest, has called for Richards’s evidence to be investigated by Operation Resolve, the current police investigation into the disaster.

Analysis of Richards’s evidence, together with new research casting doubt on other allegations made against Liverpool supporters by South Yorkshire police, are included in a documentary, Hillsborough: Smears, Survivors and the Search for the Truth, to be shown on ITV on Monday night (10.40pm). Richards was at Hillsborough – Sheffield Wednesday’s home ground – as a spectator and went on to the pitch with a doctor, Christopher Rigby, who tried to save several victims of the lethal crush, including three young men who died.

In his statement, Richards said that they also attended to a woman who died and that some Liverpool supporters made an obscene remark about her. “There were some lads behind the perimeter fence who shouted to us to throw her to them,” his statement said. “They made comments like: ‘Throw her in here, we’ll fucking fix her up.’ There were 10 or 12 of them. I was shocked by this and stood there.”

That alleged episode was similar to another allegation that spectators made a lewd remark about a female victim, which was one of the stories told by South Yorkshire officers that were published in the Sun on 19 April 1989. That edition, which carried the front-page headline “The Truth”, caused great distress to bereaved families and survivors and led to a boycott of the newspaper on Merseyside.

Along with other police allegations of misbehaviour now proved to have been untrue, the Sun reported: “A gang of Liverpool fans noticed that the blouse of a girl trampled to death had risen above her breasts. As a policeman struggled in vain to revive her, the mob jeered: ‘Throw her up here and we will **** her.’ ”

In October 2014 at the new inquests, a former South Yorkshire police inspector, Gordon Sykes, acknowledged that he had been the original source of that story. Michael Mansfield QC, representing 75 families whose relatives died, accused Sykes of having lied and made it up. Sykes maintained that it had happened, then Fiona Barton QC, representing South Yorkshire police, advanced Richards’s statement and read it out in court, as corroboration for the story alleged by Sykes.

Richards, a supporter of Sheffield Wednesday at the time of the disaster, became the club’s chairman soon after and then, in 2000, chairman of the Premier League, a role he held until he stepped down, aged of 70, in 2013.

Analysis of his statement has now revealed discrepancies in the detail with known facts about the disaster. Rigby himself did not say he had attended to any women on the pitch, but Richards gave a detailed description – that the woman was aged between 27 and 30, wearing a short-sleeved blouse and a multicoloured skirt, and that Rigby had told him she was dead.

Seven female victims were among the 96 people who died at Hillsborough and none was wearing a skirt. All were wearing jeans or trousers.

Richards’s statement described Rigby pulling the skirt down and checking for a pulse in the woman’s groin, but Rigby said he checked for a pulse in necks and wrists and it was “unlikely” he would check the groin area. The doctor did not mention hearing any such obscene remark during his and Richards’s time attending to people on the pitch. Richards was never called as a witness to the inquests and he has not responded either to ITV’s or the Observer’s questions about these discrepancies.

Doubt has also been cast on the evidence of another witness to the alleged obscene remark, who claimed to have been told of it by other Liverpool supporters. The witness, Cherry Daniels, told this story to West Midlands police, who were appointed to investigate the disaster in 1989, but her statement did not disclose that she was in fact the daughter of a South Yorkshire police officer, Chief Inspector David Sumner, who was Sykes’s superior in the force.

Daniels did not respond to the Observer’s questions about this but did reply to ITV. She said that she did tell West Midlands police at the time, and the Independent Police Complaints Commission in 2014, that she was Sumner’s daughter, but these investigators had said it was not relevant and not included it in her statement. The IPCC has told the Observer, however, that it has found no evidence that Daniels disclosed she was Sumner’s daughter.

The statement of another witness, Anthony Garratty, a steward at Hillsborough who attended to many people who died or were injured, also included that he overheard a lewd remark from Liverpool supporters. Interviewed for the documentary, Garratty said that he never related such a story and believed West Midlands police officers must have inserted it. The IPCC has said that it is investigating similar allegations by survivors of the disaster, that West Midlands police officers altered their statements, failed to reflect what they had said, or put improper pressure on them.

These witnesses now include Ray Lewis, who was the referee for the semi-final, which he abandoned at 3.06pm when he was alerted to the crisis in the Leppings Lane end. Lewis’s handwritten statement includes the observation that: “I saw some spectators walking in good humour. They were mixed.” In the typed version, which Lewis said he did not see until the current IPCC investigation 25 years later, the word “mixed” is changed, and the sentence reads: “They were pissed.” Lewis has told the programme that he believes this was clearly changed by West Midlands police and should be investigated. The West Midlands force is not commenting on any detail while investigations continue.

The programme also casts doubt on another story told against Liverpool supporters, which was included as an accepted fact by Lord Justice Taylor in his August 1989 report into the cause of the disaster: that a police horse was burned by cigarettes. A South Yorkshire police constable, David Scott, faced no disciplinary action for striking out at Liverpool supporters caught in the crush outside the Leppings Lane turnstiles, partly because it was accepted that his horse had been burned with a cigarette. One of the UK’s most senior veterinary consultants, Prof Derek Knottenbelt, of the Equine Hospital at the University of Liverpool, has viewed the footage of Scott on his horse and concluded from the horse’s lack of severe reaction that it cannot have been burned in the manner described. Although Scott said he had informed his senior officer, Insp Paul Hand-Davies, in fact Hand-Davies never mentioned a horse being burned and told South Yorkshire police’s own press office at the time that it had not happened.

Scott declined to answer questions from the Observer.

The bereaved families and survivors argued that stories of drunkenness, obscenity and other alleged misbehaviour by supporters at the match were smears put out by South Yorkshire police to avoid responsibility for their failings which caused the lethal crush, and shift blame on to the victims. The jury at the new inquests determined in April this year that the 96 people were unlawfully killed due to gross negligence by the South Yorkshire police officer in command, Chief Superintendent David Duckenfield, that there were several other serious police failings,and that no behaviour by supporters contributed to the dangerous situation.

Hicks told the Observer: “I believe that the reliability of Sir Dave Richards’s evidence about this alleged incident should now be investigated by Operation Resolve. The smears found their way into the Sun so that the police could deflect responsibility and blame innocent supporters and Richards’s evidence was advanced at the inquests to support one of those stories.”

Some research for the ITV programme was originally carried out by people who as teenagers survived the crush at Hillsborough and are now applying professional skills in the search for the truth.

The first time I had to leave Bahrain, I was given 24 hours to do so and told not to tell anyone. My father had been informed that my name was coming up during interrogations of political detainees, and that is usually a sign that arrest will follow. 



I left for London in September 2010 with a heavy heart, determined to return. And so, after the Arab Spring uprisings in the Middle East began, I was active in calling for protests in Bahrain, and I returned home to take part in them.

The second time I left Bahrain, my father had convinced me that it was critical to have someone carry the voices of the movement outside the country. I felt the weight of the entire uprising on my shoulders. I thought my exile was temporary; I had no idea that it would not be.

Being an activist in exile involves many levels of struggle. First and foremost is the struggle of being on your own. Especially for those who have been working on the ground. You have suddenly lost your family, your community, and all your support. Hardship is easier to endure when you are going through it with others. 



This solitude tends to be accompanied by survivor’s guilt. Most activists who survive when others do not, who avoid prison while others are incarcerated, and who can move freely when others cannot know this feeling very well. You feel guilty all the time, and that guilt drives your everyday life. It leaves you unable to take a break or a vacation, because what about the responsibility to all those who did not make it while you did? The feeling of guilt becomes a constant: the message of a friend you didn’t answer who got arrested, the friend request that you never accepted from someone who was then killed. The list goes on. 



When working as an activist in exile it’s important to come to terms with both your strengths and weaknesses. The first step is to confront the fact that you are now in exile, and that you have to re-adjust and re-strategise regarding the role you can play for your cause. For many activists, being successful in their work isn’t only about self-satisfaction – it is what allows them to justify their exile to themselves and not lose hope. One of the most important first steps is to map out and identify all your allies and supporters. Your ability to influence change increases with your network.

One of the greatest problems I discovered is that the feeling of helplessness is worse than the feeling of fear. I’m not talking about just any fear, but the fear of being chased by police and seeing tear gas canisters and rubber bullets fly by your head, knowing you might not be going home that night. The feeling of being in exile – of knowing that a loved one might be tortured right at that moment, and knowing that you cannot do anything to stop it from happening – that’s helplessness.

There is also the need to understand that being on the outside means you cannot speak for those on the inside. I like to regard my activism in exile as being more in the form of a loudspeaker: my job is to make sure that people in Bahrain continue to be heard no matter how creative the regime is in trying to silence them. The most important factor is to remain connected – although this comes with its own problems.

The internet means that despite being thousands of miles away I get real-time updates on everything that is happening on the ground in my country. This allows me to remain connected, to be aware of what is happening, and to react when necessary. But this also causes me to feel overwhelmed. There is a constant need to be connected, and I feel an anxiety about losing that connection. It almost becomes as if you are living in two worlds at the same time – and those worlds rarely meet.

The biggest obstacle here is the surveillance and security risks that the internet carries. Connecting with people on the ground may mean placing them in danger, and you must be on high alert and diligent at all times regarding the digital security precautions you take. Activists living abroad tend to become more relaxed about surveillance and digital security because of the unaccustomed feeling of safety. With digital security, however, all those connected are only as secure as their weakest links, and activists in exile have to actively remind themselves about the risks faced by those they communicate with. That is why creating strict rules for oneself as an activist in exile becomes crucial.

One of the first rules I made for myself after I had to leave Bahrain was to never call on people there to do something I would not do myself. I’ll share calls for protests, but I will never call for people to go unless I can be with them. This derives from the ethical position of not asking people to sacrifice themselves when you’re not doing so yourself.

To most activists, exile is and will always be temporary – at least that’s what they believe. The plan to go back is always present, always in the back of their minds. On the other hand, there is also so much to be learned about the importance of the role of activists in exile from other struggles.

A case in point would be the struggle against apartheid in South Africa. The international movement played a critical role in bringing an end to the apartheid system. While the grassroots, local struggle is the essence of the movement, those in exile complement and build on that.

There is a reason why dictators try to isolate movements within their borders from the rest of the world; and why, on the other hand, civil society does its best to go beyond borders and connect to people on an international platform. There is strength in unity and collectivity.

What it comes down to is this: can I make more of a difference working in exile, or sitting in a prison cell in Bahrain?

This article is part of a series promoted by the Open Society Foundations to mark Human Rights Day (December 10) and to focus attention on how human rights defenders worldwide are adapting to a growing list of antagonists, including governments, corporate actors, paramilitary groups, and organized crime.

It is only five years since the then foreign secretary William Hague declared that there would be “no downgrading of human rights under this government”. Pursuing a foreign policy with a conscience was, he argued, in our “long-term enlightened national interest”.

Yet as we mark International Human Rights Day it is striking how far the Tories have strayed from this commitment, not least as their emphasis on “commercial diplomacy” has grown. Human rights concerns are now of secondary importance to trade.

Last year George Osborne’s visit to China earned praise from his host nation’s state-run media, saying he was “the first western official in recent years who has stressed more the region’s business potential instead of finding fault over the human rights issue”.

As Simon McDonald, the head of the diplomatic service, told MPs two weeks ago: “Clearly more resource is devoted … to prosperity than to human rights.” He explained that although human rights is “one of the things we follow, it is not one of our top priorities”.

That much is increasingly clear from the government’s approach to a number of international relationships, from China and Turkey to Egypt and the Gulf states. On visiting the Gulf Cooperation Council this week, the prime minister promised “a new chapter” in the UK’s ties with the region. Indeed, this was the first time a British prime minister has attended the council. Of the UK’s relationships with Bahrain and Saudi Arabia, she said: “In recent years our relationship hasn’t felt as close as it is old. I want to change that.” This is despite the desperately poor human rights records of both countries.

In Bahrain, we know that disproportionate, often lethal, force is used to suppress civilian protests, and torture is rife in prisons, and yet the UK is continuing to train the very security forces and prison services accused of these crimes.

In Saudi Arabia, whether it was the UK’s proposed prison training contract – cancelled only after overwhelming pressure – or the timid Foreign Office response to the mass executions carried out in the kingdom in January, the Tory government treats Riyadh’s human rights record as an inconvenient embarrassment, rather than a cause of serious concern.

Take the conflict in Yemen, where thousands of civilians have died – the large majority as a result of Saudi airstrikes. The same air campaign has crippled the country’s agricultural infrastructure, for no acceptable military purpose. And the humanitarian crisis created by the conflict is increasingly desperate, with millions now facing famine.

All this, and yet the UK government continues to arm and advise the Saudi-led coalition prosecuting this conflict, and has angrily rebuffed Labour’s calls for that support to be suspended until alleged Saudi violations of international humanitarian law have been properly and independently investigated.

If this were just evidence of a government with its head in the sand on human rights, that would be bad enough.

But Boris Johnson’s remarks in Rome, revealed by the Guardian this week, indicate something far worse. The foreign secretary is all too aware that Saudi Arabia and other countries are fighting proxy wars in the Middle East, with millions of civilians trapped in the crossfire, and yet he continues to sell Riyadh the arms to wage those wars. It is hypocrisy of the highest order.

And fresh from his latest slapping-down by Theresa May, he will spend today – International Human Rights Day – not raising these concerns openly and forcibly with our Saudi allies, but preparing to fly out to Riyadh and clarify his remarks.

Of course the government asserts that difficult discussions about human rights do take place – but behind the scenes. Does it make any difference? Not on the evidence provided.

Furthermore, while private talks are of course important, this should never be at the expense of speaking up and applying pressure when it is right and necessary to do so. By creating a perception that the UK places a higher premium on striking commercial deals than it does on promoting and protecting human rights, our reputation in the world suffers.

With Brexit on the horizon and an isolationist president moving into the White House, we are having to redefine our place in the world and the influence we wield, more so than at any other time since the end of empire. To that end Theresa May eagerly talks up the idea of a “truly global Britain”. Yet it cannot just be one that promotes our trade and security interests; it must also promote our nation’s values – whether in respect of human rights, the rule of law, or the protection of the environment.

Prosperity need not come at the expense of this country’s proudest traditions as a beacon of justice. Reluctance to fully champion these values not only runs counter to who we are as a country, it also risks eroding our international standing just when we need it most.

A grandfather has called on parliament to legislate in favour of assisted dying before ending his own life at Dignitas.

Andrew Barclay, 65, died on Thursday after taking a lethal dose of drugs in an apartment near Zurich, having travelled to Switzerland with his wife. He had advanced multiple sclerosis.

Speaking to the Daily Mirror, the former civil servant, from Folkestone, Kent, said he was concerned that his partner, Sandra, 67, may face a police investigation on her return to Britain for helping him fulfil his wish.

“We need a law that makes it a feasible option in Britain,” he said. “It needs to be tightly regulated but why not draw the line where Dignitas has?

“It’s not easy to go there, you need medical and psychiatric reports and you need to carry out the final act yourself.”

Barclay said it had cost more than £10,000 and taken 14 months of “fighting” to die at Dignitas. He was diagnosed with MS in 1992 and endured the neurological disease though stages of remission and relapse, at times being unable to get out of bed or swallow.

In 2013 he was told his condition had entered a secondary progressive stage that meant his symptoms would not improve. He used a wheelchair for three years and was devastated that he was unable to lift up his two granddaughters, aged two and four.

His struggle with immobility, incontinence and partial blindness meant his mood was unpredictable and he was often depressed.

He said: “There are still genuine moments of happiness. But they no longer outweigh a life in which every single day is a struggle from start to end. So I have made this decision.”

Sandra Barclay said she was heartbroken, but added: “If you love someone you don’t want to see them suffer.”

Under the Suicide Act 1961, anyone helping or encouraging someone to take their own life can be prosecuted and jailed for up to 14 years.

In 2015 MPs including David Cameron rejected a bill to legalise assisted dying, but a second bill was raised in the House of Lords in June.

Opposition to changing the law has come from faith groups, campaigners who say disabled people may feel pressured to end their lives, and campaigners who fear assisted dying would become a business.

Sarah Wootton, chief executive of the pro-assisted dying group Dignity in Dying, told the newspaper: “It is a tragic and unacceptable reality that seriously ill people like Andrew feel they have no other choice but to spend their final days travelling hundreds of miles to Switzerland in order to have the dignified death they desire.”

I have always considered “tolerance” a highly problematic concept: it is today considered to describe a positive attribute, when in fact it refers to a rather negative one. This ambivalence was succinctly put by Goethe, who, in one of his Maxims and Reflections, stated: “Tolerance should really only be a passing attitude: it should lead to appreciation. To tolerate is to offend.”

Merely tolerating someone is ultimately an act of condescension, whereas actual appreciation results in seeing the other as one’s equal. “Diversity”, in turn, is an extension of the principle of appreciation in that it signifies the achievement of equality of opportunity for social, cultural, ethnic, religious or other groups that would otherwise be subject to discrimination.

Both concepts could not be more topical in our globalised world, in which states and societies are faced with increasing permeability and fluidity, and the resulting challenges lead to a host of debates and conflicts. It is in this constantly shifting climate of insecurity that states and societies have to deal with the enormous challenge of unprecedented levels of global migration.

Precise terminology is important here. Take the usage of the terms “global” and “universal”: while they can often have the same meaning, “universal” has a distinctive additional meaning that is time- and place-independent and categorical: there is a reason we call it the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and not the Global Declaration of Human Rights.

It is specifically in the context of immigration that we must reassess and reaffirm our notions of “tolerance” and “diversity”. The philosopher Martin Buber explored the principle of dialogue as a basis of human relations in his seminal work, I and Thou. According to Buber, human beings form their identities chiefly in relation to what surrounds them – other humans and the physical world. Thus, any social construct – be it in a society or between nation states – necessitates dialogue and exchange. Understanding the other – or in Buber’s words, for every “I” to seek reciprocal understanding of the “You” – is therefore the very foundation of humanity.

We need to see the other as our equal and fully accept him or her despite perceived weaknesses or differences. This is the real intellectual basis of improving relationships between human beings. It is on this basis too that we can embrace our responsibility of protecting each other’s human rights.

With every right we enjoy, there is, however, a set of responsibilities linked to it. The German government has taken on an admirable leadership role in dealing with what has widely been called the “refugee crisis”, yet it is clear this is a universal issue. As is the seemingly unsolvable Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which is not a conflict between two nations but between two peoples who have opposite narrations.

Without ever claiming that we can bring about real peace or equality in the world and the Middle East in particular, the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra (named after a collection of Goethe’s poetry) and I have nonetheless striven tirelessly to lead by example. Today’s concert in Geneva to mark Human Rights Day is no exception. In our orchestra, diversity is lived on a daily basis and no single musician can exist without a fundamental understanding and appreciation of the other, however different he or she may be.

The sovereign independent republic of the West-Eastern Divan, as I like to call it, began as an unpredictable experiment in 1999. Over the years, it has grown into an example of how society could function under the best of circumstances. Our musicians have gone through the painful process of learning to express themselves while simultaneously listening to the narrative of their counterparts. I cannot imagine a better way of implementing the first and most fundamental article of the UN Declaration of Human Rights: that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights, that they are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.

From the outset, our approach in the orchestra’s workshops and seminars has been to focus on understanding what it means to listen to each other – both as musicians and as human beings. Learning to listen in that way sensitises us both for ourselves and the world around us.

Music, of course, makes this possible because it allows us to think, feel and express different thoughts and emotions simultaneously. Music never only cries or smiles but makes both possible at once. It is a constant, simultaneous conversation between apparent opposites that can peacefully exist side by side. This should be the spirit we carry forward.

More than half a dozen political prisoners in China should freed, the United States and European Union have said, citing a deteriorating human rights situation that has seen hundreds lawyers and activists detained in the past year.



Since coming to power in 2012 the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, has presided over a wide-ranging crackdown on freedom of expression, rights lawyers, feminists, activists and religion. About 250 lawyers and activists were detained by police starting in July last year in what some have called a “war on law”.

“I remain extremely concerned about the ongoing detention of Chinese lawyers,” Max Baucus, the US ambassador to China, said in a statement. “China’s treatment of these lawyers and advocates calls into question its commitment to the rule of law.”

Crusading attorneys Li Heping, Wang Quanzhang, Xie Yang and Xie Yanyi all remain behind bars, and Baucus singled out their cases and called for their release. The EU echoed many of the same sentiments and highlighted the same jailed lawyers.

“We urge China to immediately release any individual who has been detained … for seeking to exercise, protect or promote their own rights or the rights of others,” the EU statement said.

The US and EU made the calls to mark Human Rights Day, a United Nations holiday commemorating the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which China signed.

“During the past year, we have been extremely troubled about the deterioration of the situation with respect to freedom of expression and association,” the EU statement said.

“We are equally concerned about all human rights defenders and their family members who have been harassed and punished because of their work in promoting rights which are protected in China’s Constitution and international law.”

Both the US and EU called for Nobel Peace prize laureate and democracy activist Liu Xiaobo, who has been in prison since 2008, to be freed.

Tashi Wangchuk, a jailed Tibetan language advocate, was also mentioned by both governments. His case is emblematic of the hardline stance China has taken towards ethnic minorities who do not toe the Communist party line. Another victim of those policies is Ilham Tohti, a Muslim Uighur academic sentenced to life in prison, who the EU said should be released.



“I can tell you that China’s approach to human rights directly impacts our overall bilateral relationship,” Baucus said. “While other countries celebrate when their citizens win the Nobel Peace prize, Chinese Peace prize winner Liu Xiaobo remains jailed.”



The strongly-worded statement on human rights from the US may be its last for a while, Chinese activists worry. They fear president-elect Donald Trump will pull back from defending right around the world.



Curiously absent from the EU statement was Gui Minhai, a Swedish national and publisher of books critical of China’s leaders, who was allegedly abducted from Thailand a year ago. He later appeared in China, giving a televised “confession”.

More than 120 authors also took the opportunity of Human Rights Day to call on Xi to his end his government’s fierce crackdown on writers and dissidents, with the authors saying they “cannot stand by as more and more of our friends and colleagues are silenced”.
###########################################################
Today, on World Human Rights Day, our Pen International community of writers, readers, activists and publishers condemn the Chinese authorities’ sustained and increasing attack on free expression and call for an immediate end to China’s worsening crackdown on fundamental human rights.

We cannot stand by as more and more of our friends and colleagues are silenced. Where is the voice of Ilham Tohti, the Uighur scholar and Pen member currently serving a life sentence, when his life’s work has been about creating peace and dialogue in China? Where is the voice of veteran journalist Gao Yu, who spent close to two years in prison and is now under house arrest? Where is the voice of publisher Gui Minhai, who disappeared from his holiday home in Thailand and is now being held incommunicado? Where is the voice of Nobel peace laureate and former president of the Independent Chinese Pen Centre, Liu Xiaobo, serving an 11-year prison sentence and the voice of his wife, the poet Liu Xia, who has been under house arrest for over six years without even having been accused of a crime?

These writers represent the many critical voices across China currently being silenced, including the imprisoned and persecuted members of the Independent Chinese Pen Centre: Yang Tongyan, Zhu Yufu, Lü Gengsong, Chen Shuqing, Hu Shigen, Qin Yongmin, Liu Yanli and Liu Feiyue; and honorary members Zhang Haitao, Sun Feng, Lu Yuyu, Li Tingyu, Huang Qi and Su Changlan. The enforced silence of these friends and colleagues is deafening, and the disappearance of their voices has left a world worse off for this egregious injustice and loss.

Today we call for their words to reverberate across the globe as we commit to fighting for their freedom until China heeds our call. On days like today we have to reaffirm our refusal not to be complicit in their silence. We have to use our own words to give power to theirs.

China and the rest of the world can only be enriched by these opinions and voices. We therefore urge the Chinese authorities to release the writers, journalists and activists who are languishing in jail or kept under house arrest for the crime of speaking freely and expressing their opinions.

We urge them to uphold freedom of expression and all human rights.

Irish courts are to be asked to intervene in the UK’s legally complex Brexit process in a new appeal aimed at reaching the European court of justice in Luxembourg.

The application, which is seeking crowdfunding, will be on the issue of whether once Brexit is triggered, by giving formal notice to Brussels under article 50 of the treaty on European Union, it can be reversed.

It will also seek adjudication on the more surprising proposition that Brexit may already have been triggered and that a flawed procedure is under way.

At the supreme court hearing this week, virtually all parties argued their claims on the basis that once UK withdrawal begins it is irrevocable.

It was assumed the UK could not change its mind and choose to remain in the EU if it was dissatisfied with the outcome of negotiations before the two-year period elapsed.

Academic lawyers, however, have suggested that had the government adopted a different approach it would have had a greater chance of winning the supreme court case.

Senior judges in any EU country can refer disputed issues of EU law to the Luxembourg court for clarification. It is unlikely the case initiated by the prominent London QC Jolyon Maugham would reach Luxembourg and be decided before the UK gives formal notice to Brussels by the end of March.

One of the main arguments advanced by Eurosceptics for Brexit is that it would enable the UK to escape the interfering jurisdiction of “foreign” judges.

Maugham, who has been in touch with supportive MPs and MEPs, estimates it needs to raise £70,000 through crowdfunding to finance the case.

He has had to go through the Irish courts because UK judges have made every effort to keep the article 50 appeal out of the hands of European judges.

The case in Dublin will be brought against the Irish state, the EU council and the European commission. It is likely to be brought in the name of MEPs.

Maugham’s claim will also question whether Brexit was triggered in October when Theresa May told the EU council the UK would be leaving. Since then the EU has appointed negotiators and has been behaving as though the UK is on a departure trajectory, Maugham says.

If it has been triggered then the commission is in breach of its treaty duties through wrongly refusing to commence negotiations with the UK, Maugham says. If it has not, the council and Irish state are in breach of their treaty duties in wrongly excluding the UK from council meetings.

The claimants will argue that they suffer a prospective deprivation of their rights associated with these breaches and that to resolve these disputes it will be necessary to refer these questions to the court of justice of the European Union.

Maugham said: “Put aside the legal niceties. What no one can dispute is that there are incredibly important questions to answer.

“Should parliament control the terms on which we Brexit? Could we have a referendum on the final deal – or is the consequence of triggering article 50 that we will leave the EU whatever the terms?

“By triggering article 50, does the UK also leave the EEA, or is there a separate decision to make about whether we remain in the European economic area and single market?

“Everyone – those who voted leave and remain; the people and government of Ireland – deserves to know the answer to these questions. People must plan their lives.

“Businesses need certainty to invest. The people of Ireland are entitled to a government that can work for the best possible future for Ireland. It’s right that we all have the maximum certainty that the law can give. And referring these questions to the court of justice of the European Union is the only way to deliver that certainty.”

Prof Stijn Smismans, director of the Centre for European Law and Governance at Cardiff University, said: “Regardless of whether the supreme court refers the case to the court of justice of the European Union, it may well come to the point that the EU institutions have to take a stance on accepting or not a revocation of withdrawal. One has to know whether that is possible, and it will be based on EU law.”

Smismans added: “From the drafting history of article 50 it is clear that the article was introduced with the aim to indicate clearly that a member state has a right to withdraw from the Union and to provide a procedure that leads preferably to a negotiated outcome. However, this exit-friendly intention is combined with a more exit-hostile procedure.

“The article is clearly written in such a way that while a negotiated solution is the preferred outcome, it is up to the remaining member states to pull the strings and decide which solution is best for the EU once the procedure has been triggered at EU level.

“There is no unilateral way back once the issue has been put on the European negotiation table. At the same time, it would be entirely against the spirit of the treaties and of article 50 if the EU could not stop the withdrawing process if the outgoing state has changed its mind and wants to remain.”

In the meantime, the 11 justices who heard this week’s appeal will reconvene at the supreme court next week to begin private and lengthy deliberations. When they left the courtroom on Thursday afternoon, they had not reached a final decision on their judgment.

Convention dictates that the discussion is led by the newest member of the court on the panel who is Lord Hodge. Initiating the post-courtroom discussions can be influential, enabling the speaker to shape the debate. Hodge will be followed by other justices in reverse order of seniority.

Their ultimate written judgment will be delivered before the end of January.

They will review written and oral evidence as well as precedent cases that will help them assess whether the government can use its prerogative powers to notify under article 50 or whether only a parliamentary act would be sufficient to remove the rights created by the 1972 European Communities Act.

Supreme court decisions often include dissenting judgments. A simple majority is required to decide the issue; they could split narrowly, with five justices against six. An odd number is always selected to hear a case, ensuring that there cannot be a draw.

Each justice can state their reasoning and line of legal authority for their conclusions in the final judgment. Given the political sensitivity of the case, there may be perceived pressure to produce a unanimous decision.

After a week of intense scrutiny of Brexit arrangements, this Saturday’s observance of Human Rights Day provides a welcome pause to reflect on the role the UK should play on the international stage. This is especially important when we consider how global businesses based in the UK or listed on the London Stock Exchange impact on the world’s poorest people. There are real examples of UK leadership on human rights, from support for the UN’s Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights to the Modern Slavery Act 2015. However, the government must follow through on its commitments and ensure that its leadership in these areas is not jeopardised by falling short elsewhere.

Legal changes have made it harder for communities affected by British companies’ actions overseas to seek justice in the UK. It is also concerning that some government departments have regarded international standards as optional, rather than essential protections to ensure that business operations do not harm society’s most vulnerable.

We must ensure post-Brexit trade deals benefit both businesses and the communities in which they operate. Any trade deals must be analysed as to their impacts on the rights of vulnerable communities overseas and on the environment, and this information must be available to the public. As Pope Francis reminds us, poor communities must not be an “afterthought” in political and economic discussions.

Ryanair has told lawyers acting for a woman claiming compensation that it will no longer accept the jurisdiction of the English courts, in a case that has raised concerns over air passenger delay rights.

Every year thousands of UK passengers file legal claims against airlines in the UK courts, seeking compensation they believe they are owed under the EU delay rules.

Lawyers acting for a woman known only as Ms Menditta, who claimed against the Dublin-based Ryanair after a delay in 2015, have been told by the airline that a clause in the airline’s terms and conditions requires disputes to be decided by the Irish courts.

In April, Liverpool county court will hear Menditta’s case against Ryanair, but the airline will argue the claim must be brought in Ireland. If the court agrees, all Ryanair passengers could be forced to go through the Irish courts to chase denied compensation.

Nicholas Parkinson, a panel solicitor for the flight compensation firmFlightDelays.co.uk, who brought the claim on the passenger’s behalf, said the case could have huge ramifications for all air passengers if Ryanair is successful.

“If passengers were only able to bring a claim using Irish solicitors in the Irish courts, the vast majority of passengers living outside the Republic of Ireland will probably not bother to bring a claim at all – especially bearing in mind that most claims against Ryanair are only worth between £210 and £350. To our knowledge no other reputable airlines have a similar clause in their terms and conditions or, if there are, they do not attempt to rely on this clause.”

It is the latest in a series of legal challenges airlines have mounted against the EU rules that require them to compensate passengers for significant delays or cancellations, and overbooking.

Passengers can claim €125-€600 (£105-£500), depending on the event and length of the flight, in their country of origin. The airlines are exempt from having to pay out in certain circumstances – such as strikes and bad weather – but have fought a number of failed test cases to avoid other circumstances, particularly technical problems.

Kevin Clarke, a flight delay lawyer at Bott & Co solicitors, said this case could represent the biggest threat so far to the rights of passengers under regulation EC 261/2004. “If Ryanair were to win, this could allow all airlines to select any country within which passengers must bring their claim. There would be nothing stopping UK airlines from stipulating the country in which court proceedings must be commenced in their terms and conditions – meaning UK passengers would need to find a solicitor in Lithuania or Lebanon, or wherever else the airline chooses.”

Ryanair, which flew 117 million passengers last year, said it requires customers to submit flight disruption claims directly to it before engaging third party “claims chasers”.

“Claims chasers don’t like our terms and conditions, because they are designed solely to protect our customers, and ensure they receive 100% of the compensation they are due.”

Last year the Civil Aviation Authority began enforcement action against Ryanair to make it pay compensation to thousands of delayed passengers after a European court of justice judgment. At the time the CAA said it was not satisfied with the way the airline was handling compensation claims for disruption caused by routine technical faults.

Diplomats from repressive regimes including the Philippines, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Algeria are planning to attend the launch of an official report into Britain’s human rights to be hosted in London on Monday.



The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) invited representatives from the countries, which face investigations into torture and other abuses, to attend the publication of a report on human rights in the UK.

The decision by the watchdog has enraged staff who are engaged in a dispute about plans to make redundancies and budget cuts as part of the government’s efficiency programme across Whitehall.

Ann Clwyd, the veteran MP and human rights campaigner, said: “I think it is very inappropriate, unless they have a training course built in for those attending.

“Clearly some of those attending do not understand the importance of human rights or the importance that this country puts on human rights. Why have they been invited and why are they coming?”

The EHRC is to send the report, which examines the UK’s human rights record, to the United Nations. As this is part of a UN process, the organisation invited representatives from every single UN country.

A leaked list of those who have accepted invitations shows that representatives from 35 countries will attend Monday night’s soiree at Carlton House Terrace, the grand Georgian street nestled between Pall Mall and The Mall in central London.

It appears that many of those who have accepted have received recent criticisms for human rights abuses.

A representative of the government of the Philippines will attend the human rights event, according to the list.

The “war on drugs”, declared by the president, Rodrigo Duterte, has been followed by the killing of thousands of people by police who claim to be acting in self-defence and by unidentified gunmen.

The killings have been a profound setback for human rights and the rule of law in the Philippines, according to Human Rights Watch.

Two diplomats from Kazakhstan’s embassy will also attend. According to the latest Amnesty International report, the government has allowed torture and other ill-treatment to remain largely unchallenged. This week, the government sought to liquidate independent trade unions through the courts.

A representative of Algeria will also attend, according to the list. Amnesty International’s 2015-16 report said the authorities in the north African state had restricted freedoms of expression, association and assembly, arresting, prosecuting and imprisoning peaceful protesters, activists and journalists, while perpetrators of torture continued to evade justice.

Uzbekistan, whose press attache is expected to attend the EHRC event, has an “atrocious” human rights record, according to Human Rights Watch, whose report says thousands of citizens have been imprisoned on politically motivated charges and torture is endemic in the criminal justice system.

Other governments that have questionable human rights records, according to Amnesty International, but will send along representatives to the event include Singapore, Turkey, Thailand, Egypt, Ecuador, El Salvador, Ghana, Mexico and Jordan.

The EHRC is to lose a quarter of its staff, including 24 workers who are being threatened with compulsory redundancy. The offices in Birmingham, Leeds, Edinburgh and Newcastle are due to close in March 2017. The EHRC’s overall budget has been cut by 70% since 2010. Staff plan to demonstrate outside the event dressed as Victorian carol singers.

An EHRC spokesperson defended the decision to extend invites to all countries.

“This event is being held to mark the publication of our report to the United Nations on human rights progress in the UK. As this is part of a UN process we invited representatives from every single UN country. Countries where human rights need to improve must also have the opportunity to hear a passionate defence of human rights and their importance, which is what will happen at this event,” he said.

The report is part of a five-year cycle of reviews by the UN where other countries are invited to comment on Britain’s human rights record and progress.

The UK’s human rights record will be examined by other UN member states and the EHRC, in its role as the UK’s national human rights institution. “We want to make sure that those countries have our perspective, to inform their examination of the UK,” an EHRC source said.

About five years after the first emails arrived, the death threats started. When Sarah first began receiving messages from a man expressing a romantic interest, she shrugged them off. “I didn’t realise for some time that I had a stalker,” she says. They seemed confused and clumsy; strange, but nothing much to worry about. Later, when they became threatening – the man stalking her said he would attack her, or kill her – she went to the police. Even then, the police said it wasn’t very significant and not to worry about it. She was reassured at first, until she began to suspect that wasn’t the best advice. “I realised from the content of some of the messages that he was referring to real events in my life and that, according to him, we had met on one or two occasions. I don’t recall ever meeting him. I was alarmed – he wasn’t just a random person on the internet. Or he was, but he had taken a great deal of trouble to find out information about me. It was at that stage that I became really quite frightened that he might carry out one of these threats.”

She kept contacting the police, including making one statement at 4am “when I had received a number of threats and I couldn’t take it any more, and thought I would have to go and sleep at the police station”. Still nothing was done about it. “Eventually I found a very motivated police officer, who hadn’t had much training in this, but she made it her business to make something happen. With her support, I did eventually get somewhere, but I still had to do all of the preparation myself. I had started a long process of educating myself and educating the police. I had to learn everything myself.” The victim log she put together would detail how at one point she was receiving up to 10 emails a day.

Thinking back to when it started, Sarah says that if she had known more about stalking then, she would have gone to the police much earlier and pushed them to take it seriously. “I think it’s normal for people to think it doesn’t mean anything, or it will go away, but in my case it reached a point where it was unbearable. The earlier it can be stopped, the better.”

This week, the home secretary, Amber Rudd, announced plans for new Stalking Protection Orders, which would hopefully address this, and at an early stage. It would allow courts to ban stalkers from contacting their victims, even if they hadn’t been charged or convicted.

It has largely been welcomed by anti-stalking campaigners. “Anything that is another tool to deal with a stalker is great news,” says Jane Harvey, campaigns director of Network for Surviving Stalking. “But we need to get some of the basic building blocks in place. It takes people a long time to recognise what’s happening to them as stalking, so there’s under-reporting, and then at an early stage of a case, things can go wrong – a police officer hasn’t had training in stalking and the case is dismissed, or another element, such as criminal damage, will be seized upon instead of seeing the wider picture.”

Catherine Skinner, chief executive of the charity Paladin, says: “You still hear that [police officers and others in the criminal justice system] don’t see the risks; they don’t see how the behaviour of the perpetrator can not just psychologically affect the victim – we see issues of suicidal ideation from our clients. But also there could be threats to kill, a history of violence, and things that could put victims at high risk.”

Research by the Suzy Lamplugh Trust has found that one in five women and one in 12 men will experience stalking. There have been several high-profile cases recently – a man was jailed in September for stalking the broadcaster Emily Maitlis for 25 years; in June, a man who stalked the singer Lily Allen for seven years, breaking into her house and entering her bedroom, was detained indefinitely under the Mental Health Act.

It is largely an unreported crime. The Suzy Lamplugh Trust estimates that in England and Wales, more than 1.1 million people are stalked each year, but police recorded 4,156 stalking crimes in the year to June, and just 1,102 cases were prosecuted. The proposed new protection orders are “a good thing,” says Victoria Charleston, policy and campaigns officer of the trust. “Where we are cautious is if the police are responsible for applying for these orders. If they’re not recognising stalking at the moment, are we clear that they are going to think about using them? We hope that there will be further training for police.”

It’s not a typical crime, Charleston says. “It’s a pattern of behaviour. It can be very small to begin with, before it escalates.” It is also a fairly new area for many health and criminal justice professionals. “It wasn’t really recognised until the 1980s, and the current anti-stalking legislation didn’t come in until 2012 [in England and Wales],” she adds. In October, Alex Chalk launched a private members’ bill to increase the maximum sentencing of five years. One of his constituents, Dr Eleanor Aston, a GP, had been targeted for seven years by a man who continued to stalk her even after serving a prison sentence for it.

Ruth, who lives in north Wales with her partner and daughter, has experienced stalking by a neighbour for the past five years. He would watch from his doorstep every time she left the house or came home. After about six months, when Ruth was returning to work after maternity leave, he would follow her to work in his car. Around six months after that, he started following her partner as well. “On the days when he didn’t, it still made me nervous because I didn’t know where he was,” she says. “I didn’t know if he would turn up somewhere else.” The police have been repeatedly involved, but Ruth feels there has been little support. “I’ve had anxiety and panic attacks. It’s caused a lot of stress between me and my partner. I feel awful for my daughter, who has had to grow up with visits from the police, and us watching over our shoulders.”

This year, research by the Suzy Lamplugh Trust found that 36% of stalking cases included online behaviours. For Emily, the man who stalked her was not someone she had met, but someone who became fixated on her and her family online. He found out her family’s email addresses and bombarded them with emails about her. “We reported it to the police and they said: ‘Just keep an eye on it and see what happens.’” He went quiet for a while, then started up again, trying to follow their various social media accounts. Shortly after this, he turned up at her parents’ house and tried to get in; he was arrested, and is awaiting sentencing. “It has been absolutely horrific,” Emily says. “I didn’t feel safe anywhere. I still check under my bed, in my cupboard. I spent £1,500 getting new locks put on my house. On the street, I don’t make eye contact with men. You lose all sense of faith in people.”

Something similar happened to Beth, an actor and writer, who was stalked for several months in 2014 by a man who followed her on Twitter. She noticed him “liking” or replying to every tweet she wrote, and he would write about her on his own account. Eventually she blocked him and complained to Twitter several times. “But he would often delete his tweets, so Twitter would say they weren’t violent or harmful, and they couldn’t do anything about them. It was often a robotic reply. It wasn’t like they’d actually researched it and checked out what was going on. They did nothing.”

He started contacting her friends, and a few months later, he turned up on her doorstep. “It was horrific. When I started getting a bit worried about it, I used to picture in my head what I would do if I saw him. You think of the worst-case scenario, so when he turned up I wasn’t expecting it – but I also sort of was.” She screamed, slammed the door and called the police. When they arrived, they found him still sitting on her doorstep, tweeting about her. Later, looking at his account, she saw that the man – who lived several hundred miles away – had spent the week walking around her area, looking in pubs and cafes for her.

Amy has been stalked by a man for the last four years – an acquaintance from several years ago who developed a fixation with her. “It has gone from unwanted text messages and phone calls to hand-delivered letters and gifts,” she says. “They are all of a very strange nature. He’s delusional and has mentioned God having a plan for us to be together.” The first couple of times she went to the police about it, they talked her out of making a complaint, saying they would just have a word with the man. Later, he was charged with harassment without violence (rather than stalking), and after it went to court, he was given a restraining order, which he ignored. Even though he had breached the order, she says the police were dismissive of her – it was only after she got in touch with the National Stalking Helpline, who contacted the police on her behalf, that they followed it up. “Before, they would say things like ‘chances are you won’t hear from him again’. But it was obvious I would.”

The experience has had a huge effect on her life. In the summer, she says she was staying at home all day with the curtains closed because she was worried he would walk past the window and see her. “As soon as I walk in the door, I check for any letters. I feel really tense. Every time he is punished with a restraining order or community service hours, I don’t completely relax because the pattern is that it will start again at some point. The thing I would really like is for the mental health aspect to be recognised, because I think that is the root cause of the problem with him. People say [we should] make the stalking laws stricter, but it seems a shame to put someone into prison when it could be dealt with as a mental health issue. I would feel more reassured if he was being treated than if he was just going into prison and coming out again.”

Frank Farnham, consultant forensic psychiatrist at Barnet, Enfield and Haringey Mental Health NHS Trust, and a specialist in stalking behaviours, also favours treatment over custodial sentences for many offenders – not least because it is more likely to reduce reoffending, and is far cheaper. But one of the problems with the new stalking prevention order model, he says, is that requiring mental health treatment as part of the order might be too optimistic – if the offender doesn’t give consent, it can only be done under the Mental Health Act. But he does like the idea of requiring assessments. Stalking behaviours can look similar, but the motivations can be very different.

It is widely accepted there are five categories of stalker. The largest – thought to be somewhere between a third and a half – is the “rejected” stalker: someone, usually a man, upset by the end of a relationship who harasses his ex-partner. “That group are not usually mentally ill, but they might have personality problems – they can be quite grandiose, narcissistic. If you take that group away, there are very high rates of mental illness in [the other] groups.”

Intimacy seekers are “deluded” people who believe they are in a relationship with their victim, or could be. “The problem with that group is that if you believe you are on a mission from God, or convinced you’re destined to be [together], simply imposing an order isn’t going to stop you from doing it.” A third group – “incompetent suitors” – are not deluded but their behaviour may be due to a learning disability, and they don’t realise it is frightening or inappropriate. The “resentful” stalker is someone who harasses a person they believe is to blame for something that has happened to them – it is not uncommon for MPs, councillors and GPs to be stalked like this. “Some of those people are mentally ill – their paranoia is so severe that they are deluded. But underpinning all of this is a process where [there should be a] good assessment, to spot the people who are mentally ill and give them treatment.” (A fifth group, mercifully small, are “predatory” stalkers, whose victims are unaware they are being stalked; the stalking can be a prelude to a sexual attack.)

“Even if you do identify someone who is unwell, with the current state of mental health services, how do you get them into treatment?” asks Farnham, who used to treat people convicted of stalking until his funding was cut. He, along with the Suzy Lamplugh Trust and others, are trying to get a pilot programme going with the police service to look at intervention treatment – to treat stalking behaviour before it becomes dangerously entrenched – but they are yet to receive funding.

For the victims who have to endure stalking for years, the effects are profound. Sarah’s relationship with her partner broke down because of the stress it caused them; he felt worried about her, but also worried for his own safety. “There were times when [the man who was stalking her] would say he was going to come and kill me. Part of my rational brain said, ‘Well, he hasn’t up until now,’ but the other part thought: ‘Where do I go? To the police station? Where is he and what does he know? Should I move?’ It makes you hypervigilant. I would leave the gym, look around and think: ‘I just don’t know who it is. It could be any of those men.’ In my career I should probably be using the internet a lot more to publicise the work I do, and I don’t do that. I used to be a very sociable person but I entirely stopped socialising at one point.”

The man who has stalked her for 10 years eventually pleaded guilty and is awaiting sentencing. She isn’t wholly optimistic that her ordeal is over. “The truth is you never know.”

A high court case involving a young woman who claims she is being imprisoned by her father has faced delays because of Brexit, a judge said.

Amina al-Jeffery, 21, who grew up in Swansea and has dual British and Saudi Arabian nationality, has complained that her Saudi academic father locked her up in his flat in Jeddah because she had “kissed a guy”. Her father, Mohammed al-Jeffery, has disputed her allegations and said he was trying to protect her.



The court heard that a planned private face-to-face meeting between Amina al-Jeffery and her solicitor, Anne-Marie Hutchinson, in Jeddah, which might have allowed the matter to be resolved “once and for all”, could not take place because of the lawyer’s Irish passport and a Brexit backlog.

Hutchinson required two clear pages side by side to obtain a travel visa, and her passport did not have the required space. When she applied for a fresh passport, she was told there was a backlog because of Brexit, the court heard.



Adjourning the case until 13 February, Mr Justice Holman said: “There you have it. The reach of Brexit has even impacted on the progress in this case. Who would have foreseen it?



“She needed two pages side by side, an Irish passport, and there was a backlog because of Brexit. But these things happen and we have to accommodate them.” 



In August, the judge said Mohammed al-Jeffery had to “permit and facilitate” his daughter’s return to England or Wales by 11 September but she has not returned. At a previous hearing the judge said he had heard that Jeffery’s relationship with her father was much improved and some of the restrictions placed upon her had been relaxed. She said she now had a mobile phone, a computer and her passports – though her British passport was said to have expired – and she was working as an intern.

She had repeatedly said she wanted the legal proceedings to come to an end as they were hampering the restoration of family relationships. Lawyers for her father said he had agreed that she could travel in and out of Saudi Arabia at any time, although, as a formality, he would require her to ask permission which would always be given.



The judge said he remained concerned about the true scope of Jeffery’s freedoms and had not found it easy to decide whether to bring an end to the proceedings, hence the need for the face-to-face meeting.

The long-anticipated British bill of rights has been further delayed because of the legal complications arising from Brexit and the supreme court case.

Answering questions in the House of Commons on Thursday, the attorney general, Jeremy Wright QC, confirmed that the government would not attempt to repeal the 1998 Human Rights Act until it had finalised Brexit negotiations.

The prime minister, Theresa May, has already indicated that without a larger Conservative majority, a bill of rights is unlikely to become law in this parliament. The government, however, had indicated that it would press ahead with publishing a bill of rights soon.

The Conservative MP Peter Bone, a prominent Eurosceptic, asked Wright: “[Is] it still the government’s policy to introduce a separate bill of rights to enshrine things into British law?”

The attorney general replied: “We remain of the view that human rights law requires reform ... The government are certainly committed to seeking to do something about that.

“He [Bone] will have noticed that we have a few other things on our plate at the moment; I think we will have to resolve those before we can resolve the matter to which he refers.”

In the meantime, the 11 justices who heard the Brexit appeal this week will reconvene at the supreme court next week to begin private and lengthy deliberations. When they left the courtroom on Thursday afternoon, they would not have reached a final decision on their judgment.

Convention dictates that the discussion is led off by the newest member of the court on the panel, in this case Lord Hodge.

Initiating the post-courtroom discussions can be influential, enabling the speaker to shape the debate. Hodge will be followed by other justices in reverse order of seniority.



Their ultimate written judgment will be delivered before the end of January. They will review written and oral evidence and precedent cases to help them assess whether the government can use its prerogative powers to notify under article 50, or whether only a parliamentary act would be sufficient to remove the rights created by the 1972 European Communities Act.

Supreme court decisions often include dissenting judgments. A simple majority is required to decide the issue. They could split narrowly, with five justices against six. An odd number is always selected to hear a case, ensuring that there cannot be a draw.

Each justice can state his or her reasoning and line of legal authority for their conclusions in the final judgment. Given the political sensitivity of the case, there may be perceived pressure to produce a unanimous decision.

The Liberal Democrat justice spokesman Jonathan Marks QC said: “I am glad that the Government have put this vanity project on the backburner. The Human Rights Act protects all our rights and any attempts by this Government to erode them will be met with the most robust opposition, certainly from Liberal Democrats, but also from the other opposition parties and some on the Conservative benches as well.”

Michelle Thomson’s measured, moving account of being raped when she 14, given at a House of Commons debate yesterday, was testament not only to her great bravery but also to the importance of the personal in parliamentary politics. In her speech, on the UN International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, Thomson, a Scottish MP, calmly shattered rape myths: she was wearing jeans, not a mini-skirt; she didn’t fight or flee because – as is common in threatening situations – she froze; she didn’t report the attack because she was ashamed; and – as in 90% of cases – the rapist was not a stranger in a dark alley, but someone she knew and trusted. The usual cheers and jeers of the house were replaced by empathetic silence.

Earlier this year, Labour MP Jess Phillips marked International Women’s Day by reading out the names and ages of all 121 women killed by men in the UK since International Women’s Day 2015. It took seven minutes. The sobering litany insisted that we call each woman to mind, recognise her humanity, and confront the male violence that ended her life. Phillips insisted we see a pattern.

On 13 October this year, during baby loss awareness week, Labour MP Vicky Foxcroft spoke with great difficulty about the death of her baby, Veronica, born with an umbilical cord wrapped around her neck when Foxcroft was 16. Foxcroft expressed her hesitation about sharing something so personal in parliament, before offering a moving account of slow reactions from medical staff and a lack of support from counselling agencies in the wake of her loss. In 2014, there were more than 5,500 perinatal stillbirths and deaths in England and Wales. Foxcroft’s testimony takes this out of the abstract – it convinces us that more can and must be done politically to prevent this personal trauma.

In the 1960s, second wave feminists coined the phrase “the personal is political,” encouraging women to join the dots between individual experiences of misogyny and systemic discrimination. Where once women saw bad luck – something they might have avoided if they’d dressed differently, walked home a different way, made men less angry – the second wave uncovered a pattern. That pattern provides the foundation of feminist politics.

Since then, much research has proved that this pattern exists. Now we have statistics, numbers. Misogyny is not an isolated incident. Sexual assault cannot be avoided by long skirts or brightly lit streets. Our experiences of male violence are not bad luck: they are systemic and fostered by a culture in which male narratives are deemed more trustworthy and reliable. Crucially, these experiences are not our fault.

The slogan “the personal is political” blurred the boundary between the private and public sphere. The former has traditionally been the domain of women, and the stuff of it – bodies, emotions, reproduction, domestic labour – was, by definition, not the reasonable, rational, manly stuff of politics. Feminists have tugged apart this false dichotomy, and yet women remain underrepresented in mainstream politics. And you only have to watch the braying and intimidation that represents business-as-usual at Westminster to realise that parliament is not exactly an accommodating space for the personal.

The recording of the debate in which Thomson spoke shows it was not particularly well attended. By my count there were 24 MPs there, the majority of whom were women. But Thomson’s decision to share her personal experience made an important and necessary impact. It means that the house can’t ignore the urgency of violence against women. Approximately 85,000 women and 12,000 men are raped in England and Wales every year. But those are just numbers. People are more likely to empathise with an individual story than with a shocking statistic. Thomson creates an audience. She makes her absent peers complicit. Their apathy and silence breeds a culture in which women feel that their experiences do not matter and that they cannot speak.

The testimonies of Thomson, Phillips and Foxcroft, these insertions of the personal into the hallowed halls of the political, are more than lip service. As the historian and author Nancy L Cohen writes, there’s a substantial body of scholarship showing that women in public office “make it a priority to advance rights, equality and opportunity for women and girls, in a way and to a degree that men in power overwhelmingly do not”. If statistics prove a pattern, shared stories ask us to recognise the effects of those patterns on real bodies and real lives. But there’s another step: having made their case, women politicians must move to effect change. Which – the research shows – they do.

It’s exciting to see women insisting that parliamentary politics can and should be personal, to hear them sharing experiences of what it means to be a woman before uncharacteristically hushed peers. This politics of the personal is a tactic – it hooks the public, making them listen, and generating support for women’s rights; it is a confrontation – it brings women’s bodies, emotions, and labour into the house, where, tradition has it, these things do not belong; and it is also a step forward. These shared stories signal the beginning of a parliamentary process that can really represent women. And perhaps they signal a mainstream politics ready to recognise – at last – that the personal is political.

The Ohio state legislature threw down the gauntlet this week to the supreme court, passing a new anti-abortion “heartbeat” bill that would ban terminations from as early as six weeks, the most severe restrictions in the country.

Ohio politicians say they were motivated to push through the bill by Donald Trump’s win, believing they might find a more friendly US supreme court that would uphold the law.

If passed by Governor John Kasich, the bill could serve as a test case for the limits of constitutional protections of abortion, and even for overturning the landmark decision Roe v Wade, which enshrines a woman’s right to choose abortion until the fetus is “viable” (between 24 and 28 weeks gestation). But activists on both sides of the issue doubt that strategy is likely to succeed, and say it could do more to harm the legal movement than help it.

The bill passed by the Ohio state legislature on Tuesday stops just short of banning abortion from the time a fetus’s heartbeat is detectable, which is usually around six weeks. The new law states that if a doctor terminates a pregnancy without listening for a heartbeat or when a heartbeat is audible, then the physician would be committing a fifth-degree felony and face up to a year in jail, disciplinary action and civil lawsuits.

Many women do not even realize they are pregnant at this early stage.

“If this law would take effect, it really is a flat-out abortion ban,” said Amanda Allen, senior state legislative counsel at the Center for Reproductive Rights.

Many other states have also tried to get “heartbeat bills” through in the past. North Dakota and Arkansas state legislature passed similar laws in March 2013, however the eighth circuit appellate court ruled them unconstitutional in 2015 and the laws were never enacted.

Ohio lawmakers have considered their own bill in the past. But lawmakers said that Trump’s election and a free seat on the supreme court gave them new impetus for the bill and make it more likely that the bill would be upheld in the courts.

“A new president, new supreme court appointees change the dynamic, and there was consensus in our caucus to move forward,” said senate president Keith Faber.

But despite lawmakers’ views, many anti-abortion activists in the state are not celebrating the move.

Mike Gonidakis from Ohio Right to Life, an anti-abortion lobby group, says his group is officially “neutral” on the bill because he fears the law would be struck down, after an expensive and lengthy court battle. He believes the six-week ban would be so dramatic that even the supreme court would vote 5-4 to strike it down, even if another conservative justice were confirmed to replace the vacancy on the court.

“You have to be patient and strategic with the courts,” said Gonidakis.



“That doesn’t even take into account millions of dollars Ohio would be forced to pay the lawyers for Planned Parenthood and the ACLU,” he added.

Gonidakis thinks it may even strengthen Roe v Wade.

“We will be inviting nothing more than damage and danger to all we’ve accomplished for the past 40 years,” said Gonidakis.

And while some are worried that the law sets up a test case that might become a referendum on the supreme court’s Roe v Wade president, Ohio’s arm of the American Civil Liberties Union says it’s ready to declare a legal challenge if the bill becomes law. Allen says she’s not too worried the legal challenge would have an adverse effect at the high court, since another court has already judged the North Dakota and Arkansas laws unconstitutional.

“These types of bans are completely unconstitutional and have very little chance of standing up in court,” said Allen, noting that Roe v Wade has been settled law for over 40 years.

Ohio has tightened abortion restrictions in recent years, and this legislation was tacked on to an unrelated bill last minute in Ohio this week.

This was the third time Ohio attempted to pass it, after it failed in 2012 and 2014.

On Thursday, the Ohio state legislature passed another anti-abortion bill, which would ban abortion from 20 weeks. Currently 18 states have enacted some form of 20-week abortion ban, and Allen noted that lawmakers may be pushing the “heartbeat” bill as a red herring while the other, also controversial measure flies under the radar. 



“That could certainly be part of the strategy,” noted Allen. “Both bans are prohibitions on abortion prior to viability and the US supreme court has been very clear that states may not do that.”

Kasich, who ran as a moderate during the Republican primaries but has signed several restrictions on abortion into law in the last few years, will have to decide whether to sign one or both bills into law, veto them, or ignore them, in which case they would automatically be enacted into law within a few weeks.

An official review into the failing performance of the government’s privatisation of the probation service, has been called for by justice secretary Liz Truss. 



The probation service was split in 2014 into 21 private community rehabilitation companies (CRCs) and a public National Probation Service (NPS), replacing the former 35 probation trusts.



Truss told MPs on Tuesday that the review into the performance of the privatised probation companies would be finished by April and would include measures to improve the service.

The announcement came after highly critical reports by the chief inspector of probation, Dame Glenys Stacey, found companies struggled to deliver the supervision of 250,000 offenders a year.

We asked people working in probation services in the UK for their views and experiences. From low morale among staff to excessive case loads, and unsuitable risk assessments, here’s what some of them said. 



The probation trusts we used to have were rooted in localism and worked closely with partner organisations such as the police, social care and the health service. But all those relationships have been put under strain by the arrogant attitude emanating from Whitehall. Staff still believe in the job they do but have no faith in leadership.



The recent staff survey information indicated that just 3% thought that the NPS had made improvements - I think that says it all. As we’re such a small organisation we won’t get the headlines that problems in the prison service get but if things go wrong with us, the consequences for the public could be even greater.

Nobody is receiving the service they should and it has become too difficult to do a good job. People are leaving and sickness levels due to stress and depression are high - it is not uncommon for people to cry at their desks.

I have been qualified as an officer for 11 years and have a range of experience, from prison work to managing a team of probation officers. However, I had a period of sick leave due to depression and am now on unpaid leave. Direct line managers and colleagues were generally supportive but despite that I have suffered burnout. I am now travelling around Europe in a motorhome with my children!



We’re supposed to offer a service where high risk offenders (while on licence) are directed to reside in places where they can be monitored before being released into the community, but it’s staffed with people who are inexperienced, inadequately trained and very poorly paid. How does that facilitate public protection?



It’s been awful from the word go but I wanted to stick it out and learn something new. I’d never worked in probation before. However after almost ten years I handed in my resignation on Monday. I’ve learnt a great deal. I’ve really enjoyed the work and helping people change their lives is great. Human behaviour is very interesting and although the public might not understand probation and what it does (which is probation’s fault) all of these offenders have been victims at one time too. Society is very ill. A philosopher once said: ‘Society gets the criminals it deserves,’ and that it does. 



I have been a probation officer for 11 years and supervise male offenders predominately for domestic violence offences. Before privatisation I worked in a team of 11 and had a case load of between 40-50 offenders. Now I am in a team of 7 and have a caseload of 70.

I am supposed to assess their risk and compile a community sentence plan (this is where we look at the needs of the offender and work to improve their situation whilst reducing their risk. For example someone who becomes violent when drunk will need alcohol intervention as well as help addressing the reasoning behind violence such as power and control, or anger management). In the current political climate many offenders have mental health issues and there is no longer any provision for this issue as London CRC have disbanded the mental health cohort. We also find many of our clients have housing issues and benefit sanctions. 



Before privatisation we used to see offenders weekly for a minimum of 16 weeks and each session would last at least a minimum of an hour. In doing so we would build a positive rapport and a thorough analysis of the offender, their needs and their risk. Now we have too many offenders and not enough time. I see my offenders on average for 20 minutes once a month. There is no minimum requirement and our managers encourage us constantly to see them less and sign post them more which is a false fallacy as community services are scarce and stretched.

Public protection is at risk here with excessive case loads but no one is monitoring this and managers do not care. We are robustly managed to hit targets but are totally missing the point. I want to resign. My job has become a tick box exercise. The people I see are damaged and often dangerous, with violent backgrounds or mental health issues and need support. 



I’m a custody probation officer and my job is effectively the ‘motto’ of probation: protect the public, rehabilitate the offender, and enforce the law. Public protection means assessing the risks (of harm and re-offender) of any particular prisoner. Rehabilitate the offender (ideally) means ensuring they receive the most appropriate work to address their offending. Enforce the law means ensuring an offender (whether on a community order or on a prison licence) abided to his or her conditions. 



Prison officers are few and far between, so we have to find one who has time and energy to unlock a prisoner so we can do some work. In the past, a prisoner making a request would have it dealt with appropriately. These days, I could receive umpteen emails, phone calls or being collared while out and about the prison, to tell me a prisoner needed to speak to me. 



With regards to CRCs - half the time we don’t have up-to-date contact information, so cannot phone or email an outside officer for whatever reason. There have been a number of totally inaccurate and inappropriate risk assessments. One I saw involved a man who had committed GBH three times in a drunken pub fight. The CRC assessed him as a low risk of harm because he did not know any of the victims before pushing a beer glass in their faces.

Lots of people who do front-line work are having long periods of sick leave. If these stressed people stay in their jobs, they’re not going to be as effective as they should be, or once were. The whole system is collapsing and we’re just letting it happen.

We have lost experienced officers who would rather take redundancy than work in a job they are now ashamed of. I prosecute breaches - when anyone bothers to take any action - and am constantly having to try and explain to the courts why offenders have not been seen for months. I have given up trying to defend the indefensible. If victims of crime knew that even the paltry sentences handed down are not even carried out, how do you think they would feel? The government tells us crime is going down (which is nonsense), people just do not even bother to report it.

I have been in my current role for 12 years but directly under government bodies, and was transferred to a CRC in August 2014. My role is predominantly working face to face with low to medium risk service users and ensuring they report regularly to the centre. Myself and other colleagues have yet to have any job specific training other then a few hours being shown a few key things on their database. I have received no training in relation to health and safety. I have very little contact with supervising officers to find out how their service users are complying with their orders, and there are so many probation officers with unsafe case levels to manage. 



As for the companies interest or obligation for my welfare, it is practically nonexistent. I have had one appraisal six months after I transferred, and three different line managers! I have now been told that redundancy for me is very likely, as they are attempting to make what was once a thriving sentencing option into a skeleton service.

If you are a victim of crime you would like to believe that the offender will be held to account and required to complete the sentence set out at court. This is not the case - because we work in a target driven culture. The emphasis is to get the offender through the order so it can be viewed as a successful completion - and to achieve this probation officers are expected to do whatever they can. So in reality there are no national standards, you cannot breach anyone and you can’t recall anyone - offenders rule the service. 



Previously an offender could have two missed appointments before they would be in breach and taken back to court now offenders get through their orders hardly setting foot in an office. Telephone calls are now classed as appointments, and any requirements such as programmes are overlooked, if they don’t want to do it then on the whole they don’t have to. We are expected to do anything and overlook everything in order to get a successful completion. The word public protection used to be the core of probation but now it’s not even considered.

The job used to have integrity, but now we are at the mercy of people who don’t actually care about victims or potential victims. Instead they are lost in the system and the very reason why offenders are on probation is forgotten.

I am a probation practitioner which involves risk assessment, and going out to prison wings to interview prisoners for accommodation, benefits, finances, relationships, health and wellbeing, and behaviour. We then action the issues they have, always bearing in mind the risk posed to the public. As you can imagine some prisoners have a multitude of issues. We then have to try and find the allocated officer in the community, which is difficult now as splitting the service has made this a very tiring and arduous task.

Before the split I would have had the support of managers including supervision. Now it is nonexistent and we are expected to run innumerable caseloads. We have to offer the above support services knowing they are not working. We have been de-skilled as officers due to not having support with what we are supposed to be delivering in custody, such as interventions. We are not coping with the changes that the government have imposed and hand-in-hand with the current state of the prison, police and our service, I am fearful of the future. I am afraid for the public given that prisoners are leaving without appropriate services in place, with one of the worst hit areas being mental health. I am very aware of people leaving custody with no support because there is none. 



I work in a Midlands court team. I write sentencing reports, cover criminal sentencing courts and provide information to the courts about any current cases. I interview individuals and then provide a proposal for sentence. I am supposed to look at risk levels and ways to reduce reoffending, ways to rehabilitate and ways to keep known persons and the public safe. This is nigh on impossible when we don’t even know what privately run companies are actually providing. Our team has had seven different managers over the last two years. Staff moral is at an all time low.

We basically lie when proposing sentences in our reports. We tell judges and magistrates that particular lines of work will be done when in reality, clients are never seen and go weeks without appointments. Drug and alcohol services are nigh on useless and it takes weeks to set up any type of prescription for them. Clients are released with literally nothing and nowhere to go and then appear back in court for shop theft of food - what a surprise.

Relatives of those who died in the Glasgow bin lorry crash have failed in their attempt to bring a private prosecution against the driver who killed six people after he fainted at the wheel.

Senior judges at the appeal court in Edinburgh rejected the case – brought by the family of three of the crash victims – that 59-year-old Harry Clarke should be put on trial in an exceptionally rare private criminal prosecution, after warning that to allow it would “open the floodgates” for similar prosecutions.

The family of three of the victims of the 2014 crash, Erin McQuade and her grandparents Jack and Lorraine Sweeney, pursued the highly unusual legal route after the Crown Office refused to charge Clarke over their deaths, despite a fatal accident inquiry finding that he had lied about his medical history.

Stephenie Tait, 29, Jacqueline Morton, 51, and Gillian Ewing, 52, also died in the crash.

The relatives, as well as the driver, were granted legal aid for the case in March by the Scottish government’s justice secretary, Michael Matheson.

At the time, Matheson said: “Private prosecutions are, and should remain, exceptionally rare in Scotland. However, in light of the unique and special circumstances of this case, which raises fundamental questions that have not previously been tested in case law, Scottish ministers believe it is in the public interest that all parties are adequately represented.”

The fatal accident inquiry in the summer of 2015 heard that Clarke had a history of health issues including a previous blackout in 2010 at the wheel of a stationary bus, but he had repeatedly failed to disclose his medical background to his employers or the DVLA.

Six people were killed and eight seriously injured after the out-of-control bin lorry ploughed into a crowd of pedestrians in Glasgow city centre just before Christmas, scattering pedestrians “like pinballs”, in the words of onlookers.

The accident happened at 2.30pm on Monday 22 December on busy George Square when the area was teeming with Christmas shoppers and visitors to the ice rink and amusements in the square.

The judges Lady Dorrian, Lord Menzies and Lord Drummond Young had been considering the bill for criminal letters since hearing final arguments in the case in October, and ruled on Friday that the family could not pursue a private prosecution of Clarke.

The court also rejected a similar plea for a private prosecution of motorist William Payne lodged by the families of students Mhairi Convy and Laura Stewart, who were knocked down and killed in Glasgow in 2010.

The two women, who were aged 18 and 20, were walking in the city’s North Hanover Street when a Range Rover being driven by William Payne mounted the kerb and hit them after he blacked out at the wheel.

During earlier hearings, which could not be reported at the time, the lord advocate James Wolffe QC argued there was “not sufficient evidence to support prosecution” in either case. He also argued that prosecutors must be free to take unpopular decisions.

John Scott QC, representing Clarke, told the court that the prosecution bid wanted to rely on the fatal accident inquiry conclusions, but the determination of the sheriff was not admissible in evidence. The solicitor advocate said other parties had started considering private proceedings in other cases, and to grant this one could “open the floodgates”.

The supreme court has been urged to throw out a momentous legal challenge to the government’s powers to trigger Brexit, with Downing Street lawyers claiming parliament’s support for exiting the EU was conclusively demonstrated this week.

In closing remarks at the end of a four-day hearing, James Eadie QC, appearing for the government, said a House of Commons vote held on Wednesday that backed leaving the bloc by 448 to 75 was “legally relevant” to the complex case.

The politically sensitive dispute, which began in the high court, is over whether the government or parliament has legitimate authority to trigger Brexit by giving formal notice to Brussels under article 50 of the Treaty on European Union of the UK’s intention to depart. The lower court backed the claimant, finding that parliament should give the final approval to begin the process.

Because of the urgency and significance of the constitutional issues, 11 justices are sitting together for the first time on the supreme court bench to hear the government’s appeal.

If the justices uphold the high court decision, they are likely to have to decide whether primary legislation would be needed. The three high court judges last month merely said that it was for parliament to decide how to proceed.

Addressing the supreme court at the end of Thursday’s hearing, Eadie said: “No doubt [the Commons motion] is not legally binding but that does not mean it’s not legally relevant. It’s politically significant.”

Lord Pannick QC, counsel for the lead claimant, Gina Miller, has argued that a formal act of parliament, involving majorities in both the Commons and Lords, is required constitutionally to override the 1972 European Communities Act which paved the way for the UK to join what was then the European Economic Community.

Eadie agreed that if the supreme court found against the government, then legislation would be needed. “If you declare the exercise of [the government’s] prerogative powers to be unlawful, you are in effect requiring primary legislation.”

Closing the hearing, the president of the supreme court, Lord Neuberger, said: “We are not being asked to overturn the result of the EU referendum. The ultimate question in this case concerns the process by which that result can lawfully be brought into effect.

“As we have heard, that question raises important constitutional issues, and we will now take time to ensure that the many arguments which have been presented to us orally and in writing are given full and proper consideration.” The court is expected to deliver its judgment before the end of January.

A statement released by the attorney general, Jeremy Wright QC, said: “The country voted to leave the European Union, in a referendum approved by an act of parliament. The government has argued throughout that no further act of parliament is needed to begin the process of leaving the EU.

“There was a universal expectation that the referendum result would be honoured. Parliament will be closely involved in the process of the UK’s withdrawal from the EU over the coming months and years. Only yesterday, MPs debated a Brexit motion in the house and the prime minister has committed to publishing the government’s plans for leaving the EU.”

Miller said after the hearing: “People have been amazed at the incredible efficiency shown by the judges, the lawyers and all of the parties involved in this case, who have shoe-horned around two years of work into six months to ensure the PM can trigger article 50 before the end of March.

“The tone of this week’s proceedings from everyone involved and many parts of the media showed respect, civility and professionalism and I very much hope that this will continue throughout the process of the UK’s withdrawal from the EU.

“Parliament debating and voting on a motion or resolution simply won’t suffice. I hope that the supreme court will uphold the high court ruling that article 50 cannot be triggered using the royal prerogative. Our case is that prerogative powers end where domestic law begins. Only parliament can grant rights and only parliament can frustrate, nullify or displace rights.”

Earlier in the day, the supreme court heard arguments that triggering article 50 without consulting the devolved assemblies in Cardiff, Edinburgh and Belfast would dissolve “the glue” that holds together the UK’s unwritten constitution.

The Sewel convention says that if Westminster is introducing legislation on issues that have been devolved, it “normally” has to seek the consent of the devolved assemblies in Edinburgh, Belfast and Cardiff.

Richard Gordon QC, for the Welsh government, told the court: “The force of the Sewel convention is not its legal enforceability but that it’s a dialogue between legislatures … A convention is a very important force in our society and it’s like the glue which can only hold an unwritten constitution together.”

Helen Mountfield QC, for the crowdfunded People’s Challenge, accused the government of fictional creativity and myth-making in its assertion of its prerogative powers. “It’s much like attempts to catch the Loch Ness monster,” she said. “Because no one has caught it, it is said to be assumed to still roam free.”

The online betting site Betfair was giving odds of more than 4-1 on for Miller and the other claimants to defeat the government in the final judgment.

Four days is just a blink of an eye for lawyers used to charging by the minute. Left to their own devices, everyone at the supreme court would have been much happier dragging things out for a couple of years – finally reaching a decision on whether the government had the constitutional right to trigger Brexit long after Britain had left the EU. But needs must and there was a noticeable sense of disquiet – not to mention haste – as the proceedings entered their final day.

After some discussion about the semantic differences between “with regard to” and “relating to” and the epistemology of “imposing a clamp on a conduit pipe”, Richard Gordon, the barrister representing the Welsh assembly, declared that the whole case wasn’t nearly as complicated as everyone had been making out.

“A child of six could respect this point,” he said.

Obviously. Any fool must have realised that Kung Fu Panda 2 was a metaphor for constitutional law.

“I’ve just pulled up the constitution of Trinidad and Tobago which we’re all very familiar with,” announced Lady Hale, apropos of not very much. Perhaps she was working on a different case. Gordon wisely ignored her.

Of the 2015 Referendum Act he said: “It’s a statute that had died. It has fulfilled its purpose. You can’t revive a corpse by tearing up the death certificate.”

Not for the first time article 50 was in danger of turning into a Monty Python sketch.

Next up was the impressive Helen Mountfield, acting for the People’s Challenge, who was heard out in almost silence. Not one of the 11 judges even raised an eyebrow when she compared the government’s case to the search for the Loch Ness monster. Either they were spellbound by her command of the law or were worried about getting to lunch in time. A bit of both probably.

After a quick post-prandial quibble with Patrick Green, speaking on behalf of the expats, over whether a Trojan Horse could be found in section five or section six of the 2008 EU act, Lord Keen, the government’s Scottish QC, was allowed to make a surprise guest appearance for the appellants.

“If we are right or if we are wrong about the 1972 European Communities Act ...” he began. He hesitated, either for effect or because he had already lost his train of thought, before saying that he was right either way. Brilliant. He could be right, he could be wrong, but he would still basically be right.

Last up was James Eadie, the QC with the short straw of restating the government’s case that had already been laughed out of the divisional courts. Eadie looked up at the clock with the eye of a condemned man. An hour. A whole hour to try to make the same points he had never really believed in when he’d opened the case on the previous Monday. In another world, he’d have just stood up and said: “I rest my case,” and dived for the exit. But now he had the eyes of the attorney general boring into his back.

“We do not assert a power to repeal the Dangerous Dogs Act,” he gurned, trying to get things under way with a gag. Big mistake. Lord Pannick might have the easy charm to get away with making jokes about the Dangerous Dogs Act, but Eadie doesn’t. He’s just too awkward and within seconds he had several of the judges biting at his heels. What did he mean by that? Would he rather there was a Dangerous Dog Directive? Eadie turned puce and – presumably accidentally – implied that the Dangerous Dogs Act was a a far more important piece of legislation than the 1972 European Communities Act.

With that a bad afternoon began to turn worse and Eadie was left to the defence of last resort. Throw up as many distractions as possible in the hope that the judges wouldn’t quite remember what the case was actually about. It didn’t appear to be working as Lord Mance appeared to have already heard enough and was demob happy.

Speaking of the 1972 accession, he said: “Withdrawal was the last thing in your mind when you were getting married.”

All of which was getting Eadie precisely nowhere and he soon found himself disagreeing with Lord Sumption on the issue of whether Britain had gone to war with Germany in 1939. That really might have been the only bit of the entire case a six year old could have followed.

“You’re guessing,” teased Lord Carnwath, as Eadie disappeared up another cul-de-sac.

On another point proposed by Carnwath, Eadie said: “If it helps us, it helps us.” Desperate.

With a final throw of the dice, Eadie made a last-ditch reference to the Brexit vote in the Commons the previous day, implying that everything was tickety-boo.

Sumption swatted him away. “If the resolution had been enough for your purposes, then there would have been no need for this appeal.”

The clock moved to just past four. Time up. Eadie’s existential nightmare was complete.

A human rights lawyer who was pursued by the government after an inquiry rejected allegations that British troops murdered and tortured Iraqi civilians has admitted paying a middle man to find his clients in Iraq.



Phil Shiner, whose most high profile case exposed the torture and death of Baha Mousa at the hands of British troops in Basra in 2003, has admitted a string of misconduct charges, a disciplinary tribunal was told on Thursday.

Shiner faces being struck off by the solicitors disciplinary tribunal – bringing to an end a career in which he has been involved in a string of cases alleging systematic brutality and torture of prisoners by British troops and in doing so becoming a thorn in the side of the Ministry of Defence.

The MoD has paid out more than £20m in compensation to more than 300 Iraqi civilians and the international criminal court is examining the way the British government is investigating hundreds of allegations against British troops.

The tribunal was told on Thursday that Shiner had sent a letter admitting eight allegations of acting without integrity, including one charge that he acted improperly at a press conference in 2008 where he claimed the British army had unlawfully killed, tortured and mistreated Iraqi civilians at the battle of Danny Boy, near Amara in southern Iraq on 14 May 2004.



Shiner admitted nine more charges in part, accepting that he acted without integrity but denying dishonesty.

The admissions include that he encouraged and authorised an agent – referred to as Z – to make unsolicited direct approaches to potential clients arising from the 2014 battle of Danny Boy, near Amara in Iraq; that he provided financial benefits to Z to cause or persuade him to change his evidence about how the clients had been identified; and that he on several occasions authorised, procured and approved the payment to Z of improper fees, including a £25,000 payment on 30 March 2009. For the latter charge he denied that the fee related to legal aid cases.

He has denied six allegations including misleading the £23m al-Sweady inquiry and the legal services commission over legal aid grants. A full hearing will now take place on 23 January next year.

Andrew Tabachnik, putting the case against Shiner for the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA), said: “Even on the basis of his own admissions, Professor Shiner accepts this tribunal must strike him off at the end of this case.”

The disciplinary case against Shiner was brought after the Al-Sweady inquiry, set up to examine whether British soldiers tortured and murdered detainees following the battle of Danny Boy, concluded in 2014 that the most serious claims brought were “the product of deliberate lies, reckless speculation and ingrained hostility”.

The claims brought by Shiner’s Birmingham-based firm, Public Interest Lawyers, and another leading law firm, Leigh Day, fell apart when a letter was disclosed showing that some of the Iraqis were not civilians but members of the rebel Mahdi army.

The then defence secretary, Michael Fallon, blamed the lawyers involved and branded their actions a shameful attempt to use the legal system to attack and falsely impugn the armed forces.

Fallon accused Shiner’s firm of failing to cooperate with the royal military police’s initial inquiry into the incident, described his firm as having a “lucrative business model” and announced the SRA was investigating the firm.

In February 2015 the MoD submitted a dossier of allegations against Shiner and his firm to the SRA, drawn up on the orders of the then prime minister, David Cameron.

The MoD dossier detailed a series of allegations against Shiner and his firm and called for him to be fined and struck off. The document’s allegations appear to make up a large proportion of the charges against Shiner which were published on Thursday by the SRA.

Shiner has not commented on the admissions. In interviews last year he denied wrongdoing and responded to the specific allegation that he used an agent, saying the MoD had failed to mention that its own Iraq historical allegations team (Ihat) also used and regularly paid the same agent to act as a chaperone for victims and witnesses.

Shiner also accused the government of pursuing a personal vendetta against him in revenge for his work gathering hundreds of cases against British forces in Iraq.

In August this year Shiner’s firm ceased operation after being stripped of its legal aid funding. At the time the prime minister, Theresa May, was said in a No 10 statement to be “very much pleased” at the closure of the firm as it reflected the government’s clampdown on “these types of spurious claims”.

Her statement said: “The closure of PIL shows that we are making progress … tackling these types of firms head on to make sure we get the right outcome for our armed forces who show such bravery in the most difficult circumstances.”

The high court has rejected an attempt by the owners of Southern rail to prevent train drivers from taking industrial action.

The operators of Southern, Govia Thameslink Railway, had argued that the action by members of the Aslef union, which includes an overtime ban as well as impending strikes, was contrary to European law guaranteeing the rights of people to travel and of companies to invest, with GTR being partially owned by the French firm Keolis.

But the judge, Sir Michael Burton, turned down GTR’s bid for an injunction. The company has said the journeys of hundreds of thousands of commuters will be severely affected, with no trains at all expected to run during three days of strikes by drivers next week.

The overtime ban was overwhelmingly endorsed by a ballot of Southern drivers in Aslef. It is part of a long-running dispute about Southern’s plans to bring in more driver-only operated trains. A smaller but clear majority voted to strike as well.

The overtime ban by drivers is likely to have a more significant effect than the parallel series of strikes by Southern’s conductors from the RMT union, with Southern now warning of severe daily disruption until further notice. A shortage of drivers has left it reliant on voluntary overtime to fill rosters.

Mick Whelan, the general secretary of Aslef, said the legal case by GTR was a waste of money. “Southern, Britain’s worst private train company, has wasted shareholders’ money, passengers’ money and taxpayers’ money – because the company has been handsomely subsidised by the Conservative government – on a case it was always going to lose,” he said.

“Now the company should do the right thing and sit down with us and negotiate – properly, sensibly and in good faith – to do a deal for the benefit of passengers, staff and, yes, the company. Just like ScotRail did with us earlier this year.”

Nick Brown, the chief operating officer of Govia Thameslink Railway, said: “Naturally we are disappointed. The judge said that such unprecedented strike action by Aslef would cause massive disruption to the public.

“The judge also said the widespread use of trains using driver operation is perfectly safe both in Southern and elsewhere in the UK. We brought this action for the benefit of our passengers. The judge has given us permission to go to the court of appeal, which we will now consider with our legal team.”



Whelan said the union was happy to talk to GTR but that the company had not been prepared to negotiate. He said this stance had been encouraged by the Department for Transport.

“Chris Grayling, the secretary of state for transport, said this strike was political. A line which has been parroted by GTR. But it’s not. It’s industrial. Driver-only operation is inherently unsafe.”

The news came on the third and final day of another strike by RMT conductors on Southern, but the first during which the overtime ban was also applied, leaving Southern running only about half of its normal service.

The company said train services on Friday, when the RMT strike will have ended, would still be severely reduced across much of Southern and on the Gatwick Express.

Alex Foulds, the deputy chief operating officer of GTR, said: “Tomorrow is the first day when Aslef’s overtime ban will be felt on a non-strike day. We’re sincerely sorry but passengers are advised services will be severely reduced and, on some routes, cancelled altogether. We will put on rail replacement buses where we can. We urge people to check before they travel on the day.”

The first full day of strike action by Aslef will be next Tuesday, 13 December, with two more days to follow on Wednesday and Friday, as well as six consecutive days in January.

“Peter Kyle, Labour MP for Hove and chair of the all-party parliamentary group on Southern Rail, said he believed that it would be first time since 1994 that London Victoria-Brighton trains had been completely stopped by strikes. “The prospect of not a single Southern train running on Tuesday will be a catastrophe for passengers, businesses and the wider economy during the busy Christmas period. There is now no end in sight to this misery.

“The government now offers the only way out of the situation so ministers must stop hiding in the shadows of this dispute and become an active partner in finding a resolution.”

Artist Alison Jackson has said that she chose to self-publish spoof photographs of Donald Trump as part of a protest against the potentially chilling effect a “litigious” president could have on artistic freedom.

The celebrity lookalike specialist said she was warned by her lawyers against publishing the images, some of which feature a Trump lookalike in compromising situations, and that no book publisher was prepared to release a collection of the Trump images.

Vanity Fair and the Mail Online have published some of the images. However, no publisher has shown some of the most politically sensitive pictures she has produced, including one in which a Trump character is depicted with members of the Ku Klux Klan and another where he is shown holding a rifle.



“It is a little frightening. Nobody wants to end up in litigation with the president. But I find it outrageous that artists should be under threat from a president in the US,” Jackson said.

“I wanted to publish photos that I wanted to shoot but it’s very difficult to get other publishers to publish a work if they feel any type of threat or if they are worried in any shape or form. I don’t even think it’s a question of taste … It’s legal.”

Jackson self-published her book, Private, which was released at the end of October. Previously Penguin has published coffee table editions of her work featuring apparently intimate spoof pictures of the Royal family, Tony Blair and the Clintons as well as celebrities from the Beckhams to Kanye West.

According to newspaper analysis during the election, Trump and his businesses had been involved in at least 3,500 legal actions over the past three decades. Since his election, Trump has spoken warmly of British libel laws. His wife, Melania, is currently suing the Daily Mail and a blogger for $150m (£119m) over allegations about her modelling career.

Earlier this year, artist Illma Gore received thousands of death threats after her images of a naked Trump with a small penis went viral. The LA-based artist asked a London-based gallery to manage the sale of the painting but was threatened with legal action from an anonymous filing under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act in the US if she sold the painting.

Jackson was outraged by the case, comparing Gore to Ai Weiwei, the Chinese dissident artist arrested at Beijing airport in 2011 and held for 81 days without charge. “Of course I’m worried about being sued,” said Jackson. “It is horrifying to find out that you could be sued by a president,” she said. “But that is better that not being able to work.”

Some of Jackson’s images of Trump are explicit – one depicts the US president-elect having sex with Miss Mexico in the Oval Office. “If we start compromising artistic freedom, that’s not a happy place,” said Jackson. “Whether it’s artists or cartoonists or satirists, there has to be free and radical thinking. Without that we get into the realms of dictatorship.”

The British artist said she has never faced legal threats before. “This is a whole new arena,” she said, pointing out that increased scrutiny was part of being in the public domain. “Isn’t it unprecedented to think that a president would take legal action?”

As part of her preparations, Jackson staged a fake presidential cavalcade in New York with the fake Trump and scantily clad “first ladies” ahead of his election. The exercise quickly created a scene, she added.

Jackson said: “The ‘Trump’ in NY was extraordinary and I nearly didn’t do it at all as everyone was so frightened of what might happen.” Despite being stopped several times by the police, members of the public formed “flash mobs”, which meant that the police “ended up escorting us to the Trump Tower.”

All kinds of artistic endeavour, from the cast of the Hamilton musical to Saturday Night Live have also come under fire from Trump directly. Most recently the Saturday Night Live sketch starring Alec Baldwin which imagined the president elect constantly tweeting unknown teenagers and possible bigots while in the middle of a security briefing provoked Trump who tweeted:

Forced to consider the threat of legal action by her lawyers, who have never given such warnings before, Jackson said she had to fight against self-censorship. “It makes you frightened, it makes you put the brakes on and that is very worrying.”

She admits that she will probably “think very carefully” about future work. “I don’t want to be sued and I really don’t want to be sued by the next US president.”

Fundamental to the government case is this prerogative conferring ancient royal powers, including to make treaties, on politicians. The government argues that it is these powers that allow ministers to trigger article 50 without parliamentary legislation.

The European Referendum Act 2015, which determined that a vote would take place, was silent on what would happen next. By contrast, legislation on the 2011 alternative vote referendum obliged the government to change the law accordingly if a “yes” vote occurred.

Two justices, including the court’s president, Lord Neuberger, even suggested that the parliamentary motion – subsequently carried – to trigger article 50 might preclude the need for legislation. Lawyers for the respondents insist that an act of parliament is necessary.

As well as interpreting the scope of the royal prerogative, it is being asked to tackle questions about the devolution settlement.

The government contends that because the European Referendum Act 2015 made no provision preventing the use of its prerogative, it follows it can use it to trigger article 50. But the other side claims that because there was nothing in the act about the legal effect of the referendum, it was only advisory and so parliamentary legislation is required.



James Wolffe QC, the lord advocate representing the Scottish government, confirmed this. But given the impact on Scottish citizens, he said the UK government should seek a legislative consent motion from Holyrood, which requires the Scottish parliament to approve any changes in its powers and responsibilities.



This is a provision added to a bill to enable ministers to repeal or amend it after it has become an act of parliament. Article 2(2) European Communities Act 1972 allowed ministers to amend UK law to comply with EU acts.



As befitting such an important case, both Sky and the BBC broadcast most of the opening day’s proceedings on their news channels but coverage tailed off as the case progressed. Intricate legal argument, arcane vocabulary and historical precedents have not proved to be riveting viewing.



There was much mirth over the pronunciation of De Keyser, the most important historical case on the royal prerogative, which culminated with Lord Pannick QC quipping: “You say De Keezer, I say De Kaiser.”



Lord Sumption wore a piano keyboard design tie on one day and on another a colourful 2012 Olympic Team GB tie, interpreted by some as a reassurance of his patriotism or a gesture of support for the master of the rolls, Sir Terence Etherton, formerly an Olympic fencer, one of three high court judges branded “enemies of the people” by the Daily Mail.


###########################################################
The opaque language used to capture the complex interplay of executive powers and parliamentary legislation might sound like it was designed to stifle the comprehension of the passenger on the proverbial Clapham omnibus.

Not all of the legalese was Latin, although Lord Neuberger did resort to “de bene esse”. ‘Ambulatory’, suggesting something easily removed, came up frequently.



There was much talk of painful-sounding ‘clamps’ on the royal prerogative and of turning the European Communities Act 1972 into a ‘conduit’ - presumably in order to flush it’s contents into the North Sea. 



Since the supreme court always provides lucid summaries of its judgments, the outcome, at least, should be perfectly clear.

Ohio has moved one step closer to outlawing bestiality after a bill banning sexual abuse of animals passed the state legislature.

It is currently legal to have sex with animals in nine US states, plus Washington DC.

John Kasich, Ohio’s governor, will now decide whether to sign the bill, which also prohibits the sale of animals for sex.

The bill is the result of a lengthy campaign by the Humane Society of the United States, an animal welfare charity which is aiming to ban bestiality nationwide.

“The passage of animal sexual abuse legislation is a great victory for the animals of Ohio,” said Leighann Lassiter, animal cruelty policy director at the Humane Society.

Lassiter and the bill’s sponsors, Ohio senators Jim Hughes and Jay Hottinger, have stated that animal abuse can often be a precursor to the abuse of children.

“This legislation will give law enforcement and prosecutors the ability to identify potentially dangerous sexual predators who may also be abusing children in their community,” Lassiter said.

Once Kasich receives the bill he will have 10 days to sign it into law or veto the legislation.

If he chooses to do neither, the bill will pass into law by default.

The bill prohibits a person from “sexual conduct” with an animal, but also targets what Lassiter described as “organized sex rings”.

“There are people out there who train animals for sex,” she said. “You can give them your dog and they will train your dog to have sex with a human and send it back to you. And they get paid for it.

“It is a very, very seedy world when it comes to animal sexual abuse and it is extremely common.”

States where bestiality is illegal do have animal cruelty laws, Lassiter said, but these are often inadequate when it comes to people sexually abusing animals. A person sexually abusing an animal might only be prosecuted if the animal is injured, while livestock or wild animals may be exempt from existing law.

“We’ve got cases of people grabbing birds and having sex with birds. And killing the birds. It is really really disturbing,” Lassiter said.

People have advertised animals for sex on Craigslist and on specific bestiality websites, actions which are also not covered under some states’ existing cruelty laws.

Lassiter said some states are lacking specific bestiality laws because animal sex abuse was covered under historic laws that also banned gay sex. In some cases when those laws were repealed bestiality was not reintroduced as an offense.

Bestiality is currently legal in Vermont, Texas, West Virginia, Kentucky, Nevada, Hawaii, Wyoming, New Mexico and Ohio, and in Washington DC.

The Humane Society is aiming to introduce legislation banning the practice in the first five of those states in 2017.

A Scottish MP has told a House of Commons debate on violence against women that she was raped at the age of 14, moving colleagues to tears and declaring: “I’m not a victim. I’m a survivor.”

Michelle Thomson, who was elected as an SNP member but withdrew from the party whip last year, told parliament: “When I was 14, I was raped.

“As is common, it was by somebody who was known to me. He had offered to walk me home from a youth event and in those days everybody walked everywhere. It was quite common to do that.

“It was early evening. It wasn’t dark. I was wearing – I’m imagining, I’m guessing – jeans and a sweatshirt. He told me he wanted to show me something in a wooded area and at that point, I must admit, I was alarmed. I did have a warning bell – but I overrode that warning bell because I knew him and therefore there was a level of trust in place. 



“To be honest, looking back, at that point I don’t think I knew what rape was. It was not something that was talked about.” 



Thomson added: “It was mercifully quick and I remember first of all feeling surprise, then fear, then horror as I realised I quite simply couldn’t escape – because he was stronger than me, and there was no sense even initially of any sexual desire from him, which I suppose, looking back, again I find odd.” 



The MP said she had felt “absolutely numbed” and ashamed but told no one about the incident.

“I didn’t tell my mother, I didn’t tell my father, I didn’t tell my friends and I didn’t tell the police. I bottled it all up inside me,” she said. “I hoped, briefly and appallingly, that I might be pregnant so that would force a situation to help me control it.” 



She added: “I felt I was spoiled and impure and really felt revulsion towards myself.

“I, of course, then detached from the child up to then I had been. Although, in reality, at the age of 14 it was probably the start of my sexual awakening, at that time, remembering back, sex was something that men did to women and perhaps this incident reinforced that early belief.” 



During the debate, a second MP recounted how she had been subject to an attempted rape and slept with a knife afterwards.

Tracy Brabin, who was recently elected in Batley and Spen, succeeding the murdered Labour MP Jo Cox, said: “I was 20 and the worst thing that I could ever imagine happening to me was about to take place. I was going to be one of those very rare statistics of a woman who is attacked by a stranger, not by someone she knows. 



“I was in my second year at university. The man had seen me walk past his car and had waited ahead for me to turn the corner. As I came up against him all those words of advice your mum gives you – knee him where it hurts then run like hell – well, they disappeared. I was frozen in fear. 



The former Coronation Street actor added: “As he shoved me to the ground trying to rape me, I fought back but I was battered. It was only the community-spirited Indian neighbour further down the road that saved me from something much worse.” 



The MPs shared their personal stories as part of a debate to mark the UN International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women.

A new tally of violence against women in England and Wales disclosed this week that more than 900 women had been killed by men over a six-year period, most by their current or former partners.

Before the parliamentary session, more than 70 Labour MPs wrote to Theresa May asking that the government immediately ratify the Istanbul convention, an international agreement aimed at ending violence against women.



The letter, organised by the Labour MP Seema Malhotra, notes that when she was home secretary May promised to tackle domestic violence and establish a cross-departmental strategy on tackling violence against women and girls, and that her government spoke out about such matters.



“But, as we are sure you will agree, words are not enough,” it continues, adding that violence against women perpetrated by a partner or acquaintance increased rapidly between 2009 and 2014, as did reports of child sexual abuse and domestic violence.

“Funding for staff who provide individual and tailored support for victims of violence to rebuild their lives and seek prosecution of their abusers is being cut,” the MPs say. “We believe that by their actions (and failures to act), your ministers are failing to deliver on your commitment to tackling sexual abuse and violence. We are therefore asking you to take leadership on these issues immediately.”

Thomson, one of the cohort of SNP MPs elected following the nationalists’ gains in the 2015 general election, withdrew from the party whip last September 2015 after being linked to possible mortgage fraud.

The party’s then business spokesperson said she had always acted within the law following confirmation from Police Scotland that it was investigating alleged irregularities in a series of property deals after the MP’s solicitor was struck off for professional misconduct.

When the Guardian first exposed how police officers in England and Wales were abusing their power to sexually assault and exploit victims of crime, we had no idea of the scale of the problem. Today, we have more of a clue as Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary has revealed that hundreds of police officers are being accused of sexually abusing victims and suspects – and inspectors believe the problem is even more prevalent than the numbers suggest.

Our original investigation was more than four years ago and was prompted by the conviction and subsequent jailing of Northumbria police constable Stephen Mitchell, who raped and sexually assaulted vulnerable women he met on duty. Examining the details of that case, various themes emerged; a lack of supervision, a failure to properly vet officers and the turning of a blind eye to the sexual exploits of male officers, in a still macho police service.

With that thought in mind, we felt there had to be more officers out there abusing their position in such a way. Using the Freedom of Information Act we asked forces for figures on how many officers and community support officers had been convicted or disciplined for sexual assaults, rape and abusing their position to carry out sexual relationships with vulnerable women and girls.

We revealed that 56 officers from 2008 to 2012 from 25 forces had been found to have raped, sexually assaulted, harassed or groomed victims or were waiting to be disciplined for their behaviour. They included constables and officers all the way up to deputy chief constable level. It seemed a large number. Indeed, one officer who chooses to exploit a victim of domestic violence in the hours after she has been attacked, when she is bruised and battered and at her most vulnerable, is an officer too many.

But such predatory abuse of power was – as Claire Phillipson, from Wearside Women in Need said – “the untouched tip of an iceberg”.

For decades in her work running women’s refuges in the north-east, she had witnessed officers turning up to the secret addresses and taking advantage of vulnerable, beaten, abused and terrified women who had fled violence. There was little anyone could do. It seemed unlikely that anyone would listen to the words of a drug addict, a prostitute, a woman with no money and no home, over a police office, even if she was brave enough to make a complaint.

A police service in which a macho culture had existed for decades, where profound sexism was publicly expressed, had bred generations of officers who were able to be openly predatory. And as a police officer they had access to the personal information about victims to allow them to carry out their abuse.

Subsequent inquiries over the years by the Guardian into the scale of this kind of police corruption were not willingly answered by the service. Some forces refused to supply figures on how many officers were under investigation for such offences, claiming to so could prejudice their inquiries, others said they did not have the information available and in doing so exposed a failure at the top to monitor and record such complaints.

Some senior female officers embraced the information that the media reports had released into the public domain. In Nottinghamshire DS Jackie Alexander, then head of professional standards in the force, confronted the issue head on and raised it at the most senior levels within the service.

But it has taken far too many years – and involved the exploitation of far too many women, girls and in some cases young men and boys – for the police service, the authorities and the political establishment to address what the HMIC is now calling “the most serious corruption issue facing the service”.

It was only this year that Theresa May as home secretary made a welcome intervention, calling for the HMIC inquiry. But what is most concerning about the HMIC details is they expose that despite cultural changes in the police service, the increase in senior female officers and the apparent end of openly expressed sexism, there are still officers using their position to take sexual advantage of the people they are supposed to protect.

Their behaviour is not isolated, and the victims appear carefully chosen – more than a third – 39% – of the allegations involved victims of domestic violence. What does that say about the promises of the police service to take seriously a crime which makes up a third of all recorded violent crime?

Zero tolerance appears not to be applied when it comes to such behaviour. The HMIC said there is evidence that only 40 officers have been dismissed for abusing their position for sexual gain in the past two years. That is despite forces across England and Wales receiving 436 allegations against 306 officers, 20 community support officers and eight staff in the two years to March.

More worrying, the failure by some forces to class the abuse of authority for sexual gain as a serious corruption issue, thus automatically referring it to the Independent Police Complaints Commission, is a sign there are senior officers at the top of the police service, who are still turning a blind eye.

Triggering article 50 without consulting the devolved assemblies in Cardiff, Edinburgh and Belfast would dissolve “the glue” that holds together the UK’s unwritten constitution, the supreme court has been told.



On the final day of the four-day hearing, the 11 justices have been hearing arguments about the significance of the Sewel convention.



The convention says that if Westminster is introducing legislation on issues that have been devolved it “normally” has to seek the consent of the devolved assemblies in Edinburgh, Belfast and Cardiff.

Richard Gordon QC, for the Welsh government, told the court: “The force of the Sewel convention is not its legal enforceability but that it’s a dialogue between legislatures.



“If the [UK government’s] prerogative powers can be used to short-circuit this dialogue, it’s to ignore the modern dynamic which we now have.



“A convention is a very important force in our society and it’s like the glue which can only hold an unwritten constitution together.”



Gordon dismissed the UK government’s argument that the Referendum Act 2015 gave ministers authorisation to trigger article 50, which formally signals the UK’s intention to leave the EU.



“The Referendum Act has nothing to do with the issues in this case,” he said. “It’s a statute that had died. It has fulfilled its purpose. You cannot revive a corpse by tearing up the death certificate.”

And turning to the government’s contention that it relies on residual royal prerogative powers, Gordon said: “There’s no existing prerogative powers … a child of six could understand this.”



James Wolffe QC, Scotland’s lord advocate, also raised the importance of the Sewel convention, saying it should not be ignored even if it does not amount to a veto for Holyrood.



“The convention constrains the UK parliament in order to respect the authority of the Scottish parliament,” Wolffe said.



The Westminster parliament might legislate to trigger Brexit negotiations without the consent of the Scottish parliament, Wolffe anticipated.



“If the consent would not be given, it would be for the UK parliament to legislate in the face of a refusal of consent. There would be no legal sanction if the UK parliament chose to do so,” Wolffe said.

Manjit Gill QC, who represents the children of European Economic Area nationals who could be directly affected by Brexit, dismissed the government’s claim to possess prerogative powers to withdraw from the EU without legislation in parliament as an “outlandish proposition”.

“As for [the government’s argument] that parliament can stand up for itself,” he added, “why should they have to react to what could be politically mischievous conduct by a usurping executive? This is not time to turn to a flexible constitution. It’s a slippery slope.” The court should not let go of the “bedrock” of accepted constitutional conduct.

Gill said the children he represents were in danger of being told to “pack their bags and go” when Brexit occurred. “This case is not a hard case,” he said. “Some people [by which he means the government] are trying to make it hard and putting their counsel [James Eadie QC] in a position of contortions where they say contradictory things.

“No one thought that the 2015 Referendum Act was ever intended to confer prerogative powers [on the government to withdraw from the EU without reference to parliament]. The reason for this is a political point because no one ever thought there was going to be a leave vote. That’s why there was no reason to consider prerogative powers.”

Earlier Helen Mountfield QC, for the crowdfunded People’s Challenge, accused the government of fictional creativity and myth-making in its assertion of its prerogative powers. “It’s much like attempts to catch the Loch Ness monster,” she suggested. “Because no one has caught it, it is said to be assumed to still roam free.”

The claim had been brought, she explained, “not as an attempt to persuade judges to usurp the powers of any other arm of the state in an illegitimate way or to persuade the court to undertake judicial law-making.” Nor is the court being asked to decide whether or not the UK should leave the EU. It is simply about whether the government’s plan to trigger Brexit “is a lawful act in the absence of express authority”.

Michael Jordan has won part of his trademark case against a China-based sportswear company, following the retired basketball star’s years-long struggle for control over the rights to his Chinese name.



In a ruling by the Chinese supreme court, Qiaodan Sports Co, based in south-eastern Fujian province, must stop using the Chinese characters for Qiaodan on its merchandise, according to a transcript of court records posted on an official website.

The word is a Chinese rendering of Jordan’s name that is widely known by the country’s consumers.

The supreme court did not stop the company from using phonetic spellings of Jordan’s Chinese name using the English alphabet, however, saying they do not infringe on his right to use his name in the country.

“I am happy that the supreme people’s court has recognised the right to protect my name through its ruling in the trademark cases,” Jordan said in a statement.

“Today’s decision ensures that my Chinese fans and all Chinese consumers know that Qiaodan Sports and its products have no connection to me.”

The former Chicago Bulls player asked Chinese authorities in 2012 to revoke the company’s trademarks, which featured a similar name and logo to Jordan’s Nike-produced brand.

The six-time NBA champion, who retired in 2003, accused the company of misleading consumers about its ties to him by using the name along with a silhouette of a leaping basketball player resembling the “Jumpman” logo used by Nike to promote its Air Jordan brand.

Jordan filed his appeal to China’s highest court after his claims were rejected by two lower courts.

China has long been seen as a counterfeiters’ haven and has constantly been criticised by its trade partners over lax protection of intellectual property rights.

It remained on this year’s US priority watch list of trading partners that fail to protect such rights despite “welcome developments ... [in] legal and regulatory reform efforts, and encouraging developments in individual cases in China’s courts”, according to the committee that compiles the list.

Qiaodan Sports Co could not be reached for comment.

Nine-year-old Xidollien has no idea that the vanilla pods he and his family so painstakingly cultivate throughout the year on their small vanilla farm in the north of Madagascar is one of the most valuable spices in the world.

He hides behind his mother, Liliane, as she stands among the family’s vanilla plants . He has spent all morning clearing weeds from the land with a machete. Tomorrow will be the same for him and thousands of other children in the northern region of the island.

Roughly 80% of the vanilla sold on the global market comes from Madagascar. Madagascan vanilla is used in chocolate, cakes and ice-cream sold to consumers around the globe by some of the world’s biggest brands.

Yet, according to a new report by research and media centre Danwatch, the vanilla supply chain is keeping farmers like Xidollien and his family locked in a cycle of exploitation, poverty and child labour.

In small communities in Madagascar’s Sava region, the heavy workload involved in growing vanilla and the poor price that farmers receive for their pods mean child labour is often a necessity. Malnutrition and child stunting are realities of family life.

Vanilla is the second most expensive spice in the world. Prices fluctuate, but industry reports show the commodity is currently selling at between $200 (£160) and $400 a kilo. Xidollien’s mother, Liliane, gets just £6 a kilo for the family’s vanilla pods from the “collectors”, young men on motorbikes who come to the village to buy the pods after each harvest. She has no idea where her crop ends up. “I sell to a collector. When it goes, it’s gone,” she says with a shrug.

Rajao Jean, president of a local farmers’ association, says that when farmers become desperate for food during the long wet months, the same collectors return to offer a “vanilla flower contract” – loans to see them through to harvest. The collectors fix the price and return after harvest to collect their debt and the high interest it has accrued, buying the pods far below market value.

Jean says that if farmers have a bad harvest or have their plants stolen, they can be forced to sell land, animals and possessions in an attempt to pay off this debt. He explains that a loan of £1 in March could have escalated to £10 by harvest time in July.

The Danwatch report claims that the plight of Madagascan farmers has been largely ignored by exporters and retailers profiting from the $192m (£152m) trade in Madagascan vanilla.

“The farmers are making a scarce profit,” says Jesper Nymark, executive director of Danwatch, adding that the investigation reveals a lack of traceability and transparency in supply chains. “Several of the importers and retailers we have spoken with are not able to say which specific farms their vanilla comes from, and whether there is vanilla in their supply chain that has been produced by children.”

The International Labour Organisation estimates 20,000 children are working in the Madagascan vanilla trade, the majority of them in the Sava region. The country has ratified international child labour conventions and set a minimum working age of 15, but the ILO says there are 2 million children between the ages of five and 17 engaged in various forms of work on the island; nearly 9% of the total population.

Liliane desperately wants Xidollien and his 14-year-old brother to get out of vanilla farming. “I would love for them to have an education, but I don’t know if it’s possible,” she says.

She explains that while her oldest son, Yokle, pollinates the vanilla flowers, Xidollien spends the day weeding the field. After a hot morning of work she can only afford to feed her children a meal of boiled sweet potatoes and water from the muddy stream that runs through their field.

Many here don’t consider children working alongside their parents as a problem. Tombo Tam Hun Man, 63, former mayor and now local vanilla kingpin in Andapa, one of the main towns in the vanilla-producing region, says that children helping in the fields is a natural way for them to learn about vanilla farming.

Under Madagascan law, children must go to school until they are 14, but he admits that few children in the vanilla villages will get an education.

“If you don’t start to teach your kids to do something, what will they do? It is better than nothing,” he says. With few government schools, private fee-paying schools are often the only option for farming families. There is no visible evidence of any infrastructure or investment in the vanilla communities by any of the exporters or retailers using Madagascan vanilla pods.

The Madagascan authorities have attempted to regulate the vanilla trade, introducing a code of conduct in 2015. However, resources to implement the code are insufficient, says Bety Florent, president of the regional child labour committee. “We are still at a basic stage. There is still no effective measure,” she says, explaining that only 16 of 86 child labour committees proposed by the government have so far been set up in the region.

“Retailers and importers are obliged by UN guidelines to do whatever [is] in their power to know their supply chain, and to correct violations of human rights if they occur,” says Nymark. “According to the experts we have talked to, there seems to be quite the task ahead in ensuring that people in Madagascar are supported, not exploited, as a consequence of the lack of transparency in the supply chain for the vanilla sold in local supermarkets.”

Jean spent his childhood in the vanilla fields and hopes his children will have a different life. Yet next March the vanilla collectors will be back in the village, offering loans and making deals. For some farmers, the cycle will start all over again.

This colourful, exuberant, brilliantly detailed account by Jerry White is the latest in a long list of irreplaceable books about London, all written as if the author were personally remembering what he describes rather than excavating it. This one, anatomising one of London’s most famous prisons, the Marshalsea debtors’ jail, bears a striking dedication, which remains at the heart of everything that follows: “To debtors everywhere.” His opening chapter etches a striking, Hogarthian panorama of the day-to-day experience of defaulters through the centuries, confronted with implacable creditors, back-street attorneys (the notorious pettifoggers), corrupt lawyers hiking up their fees, a callous judiciary and brutal jailers. And debt was no respecter of class: Daniel Defoe, Richard Steele, Henry Fielding, Tobias Smollett, Dr Johnson, Oliver Goldsmith and John Cleland all suffered its depredations.

Never once does White, as he describes the vicissitudes of the prison itself, lose sight of the central sickening reality of debt – recurring, self-fulfilling, inescapable debt – as it affected the individual. The crushing hopelessness of the debtor’s situation is evoked in the epigraph to the book, a quotation from the entry on “Hard-up, floored, broke” in a late-19th century slang lexicon of which this stream-of-consciousness extract gives a flavour: “Dead-beat; basketed; bitched; buggered-up; busted; caved-in; choked-off; cornered; cooked; done brown; done for; done on toast; doubled-up; flattened out; fluffed; flummoxed; frummagemmed; burst; fleeced; stony; pebble-beached; in Queer Street; stripped; rooked; hard-up; hooped-up; strapped; gruelled.”

The Dickensian vitality of this vocabulary of despair is testament to the ability of the human spirit to rise above misfortune, embodying the sort of trench humour much in evidence in White’s pages: the inmates habitually referred to their place of confinement as “this inchanted Castle”, “these Mansions of Misery”, and even “the College”. Mention of Dickens reminds us that if we know the name of the Marshalsea at all now, it is because of the immortality conferred on it by the great novelist in a series of works successively transmuting his childhood experience of his father’s incarceration there, through the high jinks of The Pickwick Papers at the beginning of his career to painful autobiographical self-revelation in David Copperfield, and culminating, in his grim maturity, with Little Dorrit’s vision of the world as a prison. One of many remarkable aspects of Mansions of Misery is its majestic progress through social history into literature, from sharp description of the reality of the prison and its inmates to a concluding celebration of its metaphorical existence, achieving by the end a quite extraordinary resonance.

The Marshalsea was located in Southwark, the historic location of theatres, bear-pits and whorehouses, and was, to begin with, beyond the jurisdiction of both the cities of London and Westminster. It wasn’t until the mid-17th century that it settled into being exclusively a debtors’ jail. Then it was full to bursting: people could be thrown in for owing as little as sixpence. In which case, he or she was charged in “Execution”, which immediately increased the indebtedness to £1 5s 6d, making it much less likely that the prisoner could ever get out. “More unhappy People are to be found suffering under extream misery, by the severity of their creditors,” one commentator noted, “than in any other Nation in Europe.”

The life of the jail offered, as Smollett noted in The Adventures of Roderick Random, a perfect microcosm of the world outside. Apart from anything else, the prison was divided into two: the haves and the have-nots, designated common-side and master-side. For a sense of what life was like for the haves, White has unearthed a star witness from the first half of the 18th century, John Baptist Grano, a musician – trumpeter, wind player and composer – of Italian origin, a convivial sort, an intemperate drinker and a socialite whose upwardly mobile aspirations had finally landed him in the clink. His wonderfully candid A Journal of My Life Inside the Marshalsea depicts a highly agreeable life. He regularly dined with the prison turnkey, William Acton, with whom he became very friendly – even attending his son’s christening.

He shared a pleasant, clean cell – and indeed a bed – with one Adam Elder, and after drinking a number of bottles of good wine, once Elder had turned in for the night, “I sat up, sounded a dozen airs on the trumpet, Wash’d my Manhood, Legs and Feet, read a little and went to bed between 12 & 1.” Some nights Elder would pay the maid (a prisoner from the common-side) to have sex with him. Elder made love, uninhibitedly, on his half of the bed while Grano attempted to sleep on the other. But such mild inconveniences were rare; Grano’s rich friends made sure that life was tolerable. On one occasion, Lord Leeds sent in “motton, pigs and fowls”, which Grano sent out to be cooked and dressed. He was able to teach in prison, among his pupils being two young black trumpeters, and he continued to compose prolifically, notably a bassoon concerto, In Five Moods.

Life on the poor side of the prison was another story altogether, recorded in a prison memoir with the sensational title of Hell in Epitome: or, A Description of the M-SH-SEA. That title was fully justified when Grano’s chum, Acton the jailer, a man of mercurial moods and violent contrasts, was brought to trial for the deaths of four prisoners. For a sizable sum of money Acton had sublet the running of the prison from the deputy marshal; if he defaulted on his dues, he would be thrown into prison himself. So it was greatly in his interest to extract any money due to him from the prisoners, whom he described as “Sons of Bitches”.

News of the brutality at the Marshalsea finally provoked a parliamentary inquiry, which uncovered atrocious conditions: one defaulting prisoner was locked up with two dead bodies; he stayed with them for six days, “in which time the Vermin devoured the flesh from their faces, eat the Eyes out of the Heads of the carcasses, which were bloated, putrifyed, and turned green”. Other prisoners were assaulted with a hellish implement: “a bull’s pizzle, dried hard as teak, some three or four foot long with a swollen end like knobkerrie, a favoured weapon of butchers who were slaughtermen”. Astonishingly, and to the disgust of reformers everywhere, Acton was cleared.

Reform slowly won the day: the establishment of the Society for the Discharge and Relief of Persons Imprisoned for Small Debts in 1773 hugely improved the situation, ensuring that charity reached its proper destination: a majority of prisoners now left after a short stay. Before long, the crumbling, fetid old prison was demolished and a new one built on the site: this is the Marshalsea where John Dickens was confined in 1824 when Charles was just 12, and where he stayed for 14 weeks.

The whole family, apart from Charles and his sister Fanny, came to stay with them, including a maid. In addition to the pleasant rooms, there was an alehouse and a snuggery. “In every respect indeed but elbow-room,” Dickens told his biographer John Forster, “the family lived more comfortably in prison than they had done for a long time out of it.” Above all, they were free from the loud knocking at the street door, the abuse shouted up at them from the pavement for all the neighbours to hear. Thanks to the provisions of the Insolvent Debtors Act, John Dickens emerged from the prison and stepped into immortal life as Wilkins Micawber.

But by the time Dickens wrote Little Dorrit, there was no place for such indomitable figures as Micawber: the picture of life in the Marshalsea is one in which, as White nobly writes, the prison stands “for the iron girdles of money and power binding the whole of contemporary society in a straitjacket that stifles initiative, creativity, mutual affection, even humanity itself”. When William Dorrit is finally released, a broken man, he is closely watched. “As they eyed the stranger in passing, they eyed him with borrowing eyes – hungry, sharp, speculative as to his softness if they were accredited to him, and the likelihood of his standing something handsome.” The Marshalsea ceased to be a prison in 1842; on the site has long stood a public library. Justice, finally, has been done.

Hundreds of police officers are being accused of sexually abusing victims and suspects in what a senior police watchdog has called “the most serious corruption issue facing the service”.

Forces across England and Wales received 436 allegations of abuse of power for sexual gain against 306 police officers, 20 police community support officers and eight staff in the two years to March but inspectors believe the problem is even more prevalent than the numbers suggest.



Despite the large numbers, there is evidence that only 40 officers or staff have been dismissed for abusing authority for sexual gain in a similar period.

Vulnerable individuals, including domestic abuse victims, alcohol and drug addicts, sex workers and arrested suspects were among those targeted by officers and staff, Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) said.

Victim groups have said the findings are “deeply concerning” and involved some of the most vulnerable people in society.

Mike Cunningham, inspector of constabulary and former chief constable of Staffordshire police, said: “This is the most serious corruption issue facing the service. What can be worse than a guardian abusing the trust and confidence of an abused person? There can be no greater violation of public trust.”

“It is probably more likely the problem is more serious than the numbers reported back to us,” he added.

“In many cases the victims are vulnerable people. They are victims of domestic abuse, they’re victims who might have been arrested and they have drug or alcohol dependency. It is an exploitation of power where the guardian becomes the abuser.”

One of the most high-profile cases of police officers abusing their power in recent history was that of Stephen Mitchell, who was jailed for life in 2011 for raping and sexually assaulting vulnerable women he had arrested.

Mitchell, who was a constable with Northumbria police, abused heroin addicts, shoplifters and a disabled teenager by offering them help while in custody, then demanding sexual favours afterwards.

Earlier this year, DS Robert Dawson, a Metropolitan police officer who had sex with a vulnerable alleged rape victim, was formally dismissed from the force. A tribunal heard that in 2010, while investigating an allegation of serious sexual assault, Dawson engaged in an inappropriate sexual relationship with the victim.

PC Simon Salway, who had sex with vulnerable witnesses and victims of crime, and fathered a child with one of the women he exploited, was found guilty of six charges of misconduct in a public office at Luton crown court last year.

HMIC found that more than a third (39%) of the allegations of abuse of authority for sexual gain involved victims of domestic abuse. As part of its research the inspectorate carried out an online survey of domestic abuse practitioners between July and August. Sixty-eight practitioners (16%) of the 414 who took part said victims of domestic abuse had disclosed that an officer or member of police staff had abused their authority to exploit them or develop an inappropriate relationship with them.



The chief executive of the domestic violence charity Refuge, Sandra Horley, said: “Widespread reports of police officers exploiting women for sexual gain … are horrific – but unsurprising.

“Refuge is glad HMIC’s report has shone a light on this issue, following a consultation with domestic violence practitioners including our frontline staff. The police are meant to protect the public from harm; how can women be expected to report their abuse, if they fear the police will abuse them all over again? Women have the right to safety and protection.

“Refuge commends the work HMIC has already done in improving the police response to domestic violence; we hope this report will mean an end to what is an appalling abuse of power.”

Mark Castle, chief executive of the independent charity Victim Support, said: “These allegations are deeply concerning. The victims involved are some of the most vulnerable people in our society, who have been exploited by the people they should be able to trust the most, the police.

“In order to maintain public confidence in the police it’s critical that forces recognise this behaviour as the serious corruption that it is and report all cases to the IPCC to ensure that they are thoroughly and robustly investigated.”

The HMIC findings formed part of a broader inspection of police legitimacy, which concluded victims’ satisfaction with the way they were treated by police remained high. The investigation was ordered by the then home secretary, Theresa May. 



But the inspectorate said forces still needed to become more proactive in rooting out officers and staff abusing power for sexual gain. This could involve profiling officers to single out those who might be likely to commit such abuse.

Cunningham said one of the reasons the inspectorate believed the figures belied a greater problem was that forces in England and Wales did not have a consistent and coherent approach to tackling the problem.

Not all forces class the abuse of authority for sexual gain as a serious corruption issue, which HMIC says they should. This would mean any allegation would be automatically referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) for investigation.

HMIC was only able to find 40 cases on the national disapproved register in which officers or staff were dismissed for abusing power for sexual gain during the period in which more than 400 allegations were received.

“What’s less clear is what’s happening with those allegations, how those allegations are being pursued, how they translate into gross misconduct hearings and sackings,” Cunningham said.

HMIC said the problem remained despite recommendations in a 2012 IPCC report on the issue, which appear to have not been acted on.

In her speech to the Police Federation conference earlier this year, May said: “We know of officers who develop inappropriate relationships with victims of domestic abuse. They have ignored their professional duty and their moral responsibility, and instead abused their position of power to exploit victims. We do not know the true scale of this, but everyone in this room will know it goes on far more than we might care to admit.”

Ex-Lord’s Resistance Army commander is accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity by international criminal court

An amnesty for gay and bisexual men convicted of consensual sex with people of the same sex has been extended to Northern Ireland. Until Wednesday, the region was excluded from legislation that posthumously pardons men convicted of sexual offences that are no longer illegal and allows the living to apply to have convictions overturned.

The legislation did not apply to Northern Ireland because justice powers have been devolved to the Stormont parliament since 2010. But an amendment to the policing and crime bill tabled in the House of Lords by Lord Lexden on Wednesday was passed, and means that hundreds of Northern Irish gay and bisexual men can apply to have their names cleared of such offences.



Announcing the measure, Northern Ireland Office minister Kris Hopkins said: “It is hugely important that we pardon people convicted of historical sexual offences who would be innocent of any crime today. While respecting that this is a devolved issue in Northern Ireland, both the secretary of state and I voted in support of equal marriage in England and Wales in 2013 and will continue to advocate LGBT equality issues across the UK.

“Today’s amendment is an important milestone for tolerance and equality in Northern Ireland and I welcome it unreservedly.”

An applicant from Northern Ireland will now be eligible for a “disregard” if the other person involved consented and was aged 17 or over at the time, and the conduct would not now constitute the offence of sexual activity in a public lavatory. The Northern Ireland Department of Justice must be satisfied that the conduct is no longer criminal. A similar scheme operates for offences in England and Wales.

The legislation has been nicknamed Turing’s law, after the Bletchley Park codebreaker and father of modern computing, Alan Turing, who killed himself in 1954 after being convicted of gross indecency with a 19-year-old man in 1952. The British government only pardoned Turing for his conviction in 2013.

The amendment is different from the “Turing law” proposed by John Nicolson of the SNP, which would have given an automatic pardon to men convicted under the obsolete laws relating to gross indecency with other men. It was obstructed in October by a justice minister, Sam Gyimah, who ensured the bill could not go forward because he spoke for so long that it ran out of time.

However, the Scottish parliament is bringing forward a Scottish “Turing law” to automatically pardon gay and bisexual men convicted of sexual offences that are no longer criminal.

Northern Ireland is still the main battleground in the UK in the struggle for gay rights. It remains the only region where gay marriage is not recognised in law, mainly due to the opposition of the Democratic Unionist party in the Northern Ireland Assembly.

The formal consent of the Stormont assembly would be required before Brexit because the process would “drive a wedge” between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, the supreme court has been told.

On the third day of the politically sensitive hearing, legal consensus over the UK’s unwritten constitution began to fray as lawyers from Belfast and Edinburgh argued that even parliament on its own cannot trigger article 50 of the treaty on European Union.

Submissions by Northern Ireland QCs and Scotland’s lord advocate introduced an extra dimension of political and legal complexity into Theresa May’s attempt to take the UK out of the EU. If successful, they would force the government to obtain the support not only of MPs and peers at Westminster but also the approval of the devolved legislatures.

So far most of the dispute inside the packed, neo-Tudor courtroom has focused on whether the government or parliament has legitimate authority to trigger Brexit by giving formal notice to Brussels under article 50 of the UK’s intention to depart. Because of the urgency and significance of the constitutional issues, for the first time 11 justices are sitting together on the supreme court bench to hear the case.

There was passing reference in court to the House of Commons debate on Brexit held on Wednesday, but Lord Pannick QC, who represents the lead claimant, Gina Miller, told the justices: “Only an act of parliament can lawfully confer power on the [government] to give notification under article 50. The law is not altered by a motion in parliament. A motion in parliament cannot effect the legal issue in this case.” The government’s QC, James Eadie, has already indicated that any bill put before parliament would only contain a “one-line” statement.

David Scoffield QC, who represents politicians and civil rights groups across Northern Ireland’s divided community, told the court that leaving the EU would involve “driving a wedge” between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland.

He agreed with arguments presented by other claimants that ministers could not trigger Brexit on the basis of residual prerogative powers and that parliamentary authority would be required. The government’s assertion of its powers “are cavalier – with both a large ‘C’ and a small ‘c’,” Scoffield said, referring back to the English civil war and 17th century battles between parliament and the crown.

But he then went on to argue that the Good Friday agreement and the 1998 legislative settlement of the Troubles had created additional rights for the people of Northern Ireland, many aspects of which, like the north-south ministerial council, stipulated close cooperation within the EU between governments in Belfast and Dublin.

“The agreement expressly said that the UK and Ireland would develop close cooperation as partners operating within the EU,” Scoffield said. “It required the implementation of EU programmes on an all-Ireland and cross-border basis.”

Numerous bodies have a “clear operational remit” to work together across the island. “The [Good Friday] agreement makes it clear that the elements hang together and are interlocking,” Scoffield added. Even control over international relationships with the Irish Republic has been transferred to the Northern Ireland assembly.

Ronan Lavery QC – who represents Raymond McCord, a campaigner for victims’ rights in Northern Ireland whose son was killed by loyalist paramilitaries – went further, telling the supreme court that Good Friday agreement transferred sovereignty out of parliament’s hands.

“It would be unconstitutional for the UK to withdraw from the EU without the consent of the people of Northern Ireland,” Lavery said. “Being part of the EU was part of the [1998] constitutional settlement. There has been a transfer of sovereignty under the Good Friday agreement and the Northern Ireland Act. The people of Northern Ireland now have sovereignty over any constitutional change rather than parliament. The notion that parliament is supreme or has primacy has gone.”

Triggering article 50 without the agreement of the Stormont assembly, Lavery said, undermines the principle of “consent and self-determination” expressed by the Northern Ireland Act.

James Wolffe QC, Scotland’s lord advocate, who represents the views of the SNP government, referred to the Sewel convention, which says that if Westminster is introducing legislation on issues that have been devolved it “normally” has to seek the consent of the devolved assemblies in Edinburgh, Belfast and Cardiff.

“I do not assert that the Scottish parliament has a veto on withdrawal from the EU,” Wolffe told the judges, “but the question of whether the Scottish parliament consents is a matter of constitutional significance.” The Sewel convention, he said, “entitles these legislatures to have a voice in the decision”.

Earlier Dominic Chambers QC, who represents Deir Dos Santos, the second main claimant, told the court that if Theresa May triggered Brexit without proper parliamentary approval she would be acting “unlawfully”.

“Parliament is supreme,” Chambers said. “No person or body can override or nullify legislation. These EU law rights [acquired through the 1972 European Communities Act] are enshrined in parliamentary legislation.

“By triggering article 50 these statutory rights will be nullified and overridden. The absence of parliamentary authorisation for the executive to override primary legislation ... will be contrary to the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty and therefore it will be acting unlawfully.”

Chambers said that the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty was “forged on the battlefields of the 17th century in the [English civil war] between crown and parliament”.

During the hearing, Lord Sumption’s ties have drawn pointed comments from those watching online. On Wednesday, he sported a colourful 2012 Olympic Team GB tie. 



On another day Sumption had what appeared to be a piano keyboard design dangling from his neck. Was the Olympic tie a subliminal message to reassure patriotic readers or a gesture of support for the master of the rolls, Sir Terence Etherton, one of the three high court judges condemned by the Daily Mail as “enemies of the people”? Etherton was an Olympic fencer.

Cicero would have seen a funny thing on the way to the forum this week. The issue before the highest court in the land was a fine nuance of constitutional law. The judge in charge, Lord Neuberger, was telling a howling mob to stop shouting over what he insisted was a boring legal decision. His judges would decide it themselves, boringly. Everyone go home.

To the mob it was not boring at all. It was raw politics. Cicero would have pointed out to his scribe, Tiro, that all the Brexiters were on one side of the case and all the remainers on the other. This is purely a matter of law? Pull the other one, Tiro, it’s got Capitoline bells on it.

The joy of an unwritten constitution is that everyone can claim to be its custodian. That includes journalists, scholars, soldiers and, in pride of place, judges. As for the last of these, it has long suited the British establishment to keep them aloof from the boggy no-man’s-land between the crown (government) and parliament (the people). That way everyone can chip in, and chop off King Charles I’s head if things get out of hand. The one thing borne in every Briton from birth is that parliament, not any judge, is absolute boss.

Hence this week’s theatrical fun and games at the supreme court over Brexit. Theresa May’s case is that she is “triggering” article 50 because the public told her to do so back in June. In 2015 parliament had specifically asked the electorate for a yes-or-no vote on Europe. No one then suggested Brexit would not mean Brexit. It was clearly understood that no meant leave. For parliament to call a referendum was for parliament to will its implementation.

Speaking for the government on Monday, Jeremy Wright QC pleaded that the custom and practice of treaties was for governments to negotiate and then seek parliamentary ratification. It happens all the time, as with those at Lisbon and Maastricht.

The reason is that treaties are tricky things. Their negotiation cannot be open to ongoing scrutiny or serial ratification. All the referendum did was start the process. It seems possible that a European court or other court could bolster this case by allowing that article 50 is revocable – indeed any ratification process would imply that. So what’s the big problem?

The government’s opponents argue that a decision to withdraw from the EU is a decision to change a range of domestic laws. Commencing that process should require parliamentary authorisation, not a mere plebiscite. The 1972 European Communities Act is not just about cod-fish quotas or climate change targets. It is about myriad laws that have been enacted since joining Europe. Article 50 would formally embark on a road to rescind them. Any move down that path – revocable or not – should be legally “authorised”, they argue, by act of parliament, even just a one-liner.

The remain lawyer, Lord Pannick, today argued that ministers do not have unlimited prerogative power in interpreting the will of the parliament. Parliament ordered a referendum, but it was for parliament then to decide what to do with the outcome. At present there is no law authorising the government to take Britain out of the EU, just various political statements around the time of the referendum. For May to interpret this as sufficient to dismantle the totality of powers in the 1972 act was going too far.

This is an argument over “going too far”. Pannick’s argument will of course convince the remainers, as it delays the path to Brexit. It will seem mere nitpicking to leavers. His strongest point is that ministers specifically did not amend the 2015 EU referendum bill to make the vote legally binding. But for myself I cannot see what real difference would be made now by a one-line act “authorising” the referendum.

We know that the country is deeply split on Brexit. Any leader would be wise to proceed with care and consultation, and that includes with parliament. May would clearly have been wise to guard her flank after the referendum and go straight to the Commons for a vote of confidence on triggering article 50. She would have been wise to promise updates to a trusty and confidential Commons committee. She would have been wise to have conceded, earlier than now, some sight of negotiating objectives, however vague. And she would have been wise to have under her belt a one-clause act of parliament.

But to say that the prime minister has played close to the wind of constitutional propriety is not to say she has acted illegally. In the supreme court on Monday, Neuberger made an elegant plea to respect his judges’ impartiality. But he was entering a snake pit. Legal judgments about the utility of one-clause bills are dancing on the head of a pin. If May is found to have been in the wrong, it will be a trivial sin, merely detracting from the many more serious tactical errors she has made so far.

Much worse is that it will be howled out of court by an outraged tribe of leavers. They will be convinced, with some justice, that they are up against a London mafia of bad-loser judges, politicians and journalists, out to use every trick in the book to cheat the public of its decision. In this suspicion they would be correct.

All that should matter is how best to play out the fact of Brexit to the nation’s advantage. I can accept the wisdom – and legal rigour – of a one-clause act, authorising the government to obey the will of the people as it is already doing, but this borders on the nerdish. It is an argument more suited to a politics seminar than a supreme court.

What the judges should do instead is turn the case back on parliament. It rightly claims sovereignty. It can face down any government. It can demand the referendum be ignored and article 50 not be invoked. It can pass any motion and change any law. The trouble is it has lost such guts.

MPs are too spineless to act beyond the realm of the executive. When supposedly upset, they now want judges to do their work for them, to get them off the hook of badly drafted laws. The judges should tell the MPs they caused this mess. They should get themselves out of it. Case dismissed, not our problem.

Prosecutors at The Hague war crimes tribunal have called for a life sentence to be imposed on the Bosnian Serb military commander, Ratko Mladić, for genocide and crimes against humanity committed by his forces in the 1992-95 Bosnian war.

Any lesser penalty would be “an insult to the victims, living and dead, and an affront to justice” said Alan Tieger, closing the prosecution’s case on Wednesday at the end of a trial that has taken more than four and a half years at the international criminal tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY).

Mladić, now aged 74, listened to the prosecutors’ closing arguments impassively, watching as they showed videos of him from the war, striding through captured towns, issuing orders to his soldiers.

He was a senior officer in the Yugoslav army in 1991 when the socialist federation fell apart. He commanded Bosnian Serb forces that cut the country in two when Bosnia declared its independence the next year and remained in command through the more than three years of war, in which 100,000 people died.

Mladić is accused of war crimes, crimes against humanity and two counts of genocide. One is for the siege of Sarajevo, where his troops ringed the city for 46 months, the longest siege in modern history, subjecting its residents to relentless shelling and sniping.

“The time has come for Ratko Mladić to be held accountable for each of his victims and all the communities he destroyed,” Tieger said. “Nobody can even imagine the depth of suffering for which Mladić is responsible,” he added.

In their three-day closing statement, prosecutors played a recording of an intercepted radio conversation in May 1992 with one of his officers, in which Mladić ordered artillery fire on two Sarajevo districts “because not many Serbs live there”.

“Let’s drive them out of their minds, so they cannot sleep,” he is heard saying.

One of the prosecution lawyers, Adam Weber, told the tribunal that Mladić’s “personal approval … was necessary” for Serb forces to shell the city using a specially modified bomb that was hurled into central Sarajevo in the later stages of the war.

The second genocide count was for the slaughter of more than 7,000 Muslim men and boys from the town of Srebrenica. Most of them were taken away in buses after the supposedly UN-protected enclave fell to Mladić’s troops, lined up and shot, with their bodies dumped in mass graves.

“There’s too much pain, there’s too much for any of us to truly comprehend the nature and scope of the shared misery of the women and survivors of the Srebrenica community,” said Peter McCloskey, a prosecution lawyer. “We can, however, strike back, as mandated by the security council with the creation of this tribunal to expose the horrific crimes of this war and try those most responsible for them.”

McCloskey added: “We have identified the key men responsible for it. We have Mladić in the dock answering for his crimes.”

Mladić has pleaded innocent to the charges and his defence counsel will make its closing statements between 9 and 13 December. A verdict is expected next year.



The Mladić trial is one of the last cases to be heard by the ICTY, which was set up in 1993. The Bosnian Serb political leader, Radovan Karadžić, is to appeal his 40-year sentence, which was issued by the court in March this year. The failure to impose life imprisonment, despite the fact that Karadžić was found guilty of genocide for the Srebrenica massacre, sparked fury among Bosnian survivors.

Refik Hodzic, a survivor from Prijedor, and now communications director for the International Centre for Transitional Justice, said the ICTY trials had not succeeded in preventing a wave of revisionism and denial in the Serb-controlled half of Bosnia, where some of the convicted war criminals are hailed as heroes.

The proceedings in The Hague, he said, “presented the reality of the roles played by Mladic and other cogs in that machine, which has undertaken this dirty work. “

“One could clearly see from the evidence presented that Mladić, Karadžić and others from the Serb leadership of the time were not mythical characters – neither monsters, as the Bosniak victim narrative paints them, nor heroes and “fathers of the nation” as they are presented by the dominant Serb politic – but banal, self-centred opportunists drunk on the unchecked power to command lives and deaths of hundreds of thousands of people.”

With Theresa May off in Bahrain painting her Turner prize-losing Brexit red, white and blue, the short straw of standing in for her at prime minister’s questions fell to the leader of the house. It was David Lidington’s bad luck to have found himself up against a forensic Emily Thornberry rather than the haphazard Jeremy Corbyn; it was his misjudgment to come to the house almost totally unprepared.

The shadow foreign secretary doesn’t normally cover herself in glory at the dispatch box, often managing to antagonise as many in her own party as she does on the government benches. But for her promotion to PMQs, she had come unusually well-primed. Her plan was nothing less than Lidington’s assassination.

Could the leader of the house give a simple answer to a simple question? Was Britain planning to stay in the customs union? Yes or no? Lidington appeared startled. Whatever instructions the prime minister had left him on her Post-it note, it hadn’t included this. He waved his arms around theatrically, as if hoping to drag up an answer with a little method thinking. Nothing. Nada. Customs union was well above his pay grade, but he was sure the government had a great plan.

Thornberry pressed him a little harder. Did he remember saying back in February that leaving the customs union would be a total disaster? “Does the minister still agree with himself?” she inquired, twisting the stiletto. The look of panic that crossed Lidington’s face suggested he remembered it only too well.

“Um, er,” he mumbled. “Things have changed a lot since then.” Certainly they had for Lidington, who was now entering a possible career-ending parallel universe. Someone passed him a note, which he eagerly opened. “The customs union is not a binary issue. There’s at least four possible outcomes.” He had no idea whether this was true, no idea of what it meant, but it was all he had to offer. The next time Theresa went away, she could get someone else to do her dirty work; up in the gallery, the prime minister’s advisers were having much the same thought.

Customs union was also on the agenda as part of the opposition day Brexit debate. Faced with the certainty of being defeated, the government had quickly tabled an amendment promising to publish some kind of plan before triggering article 50 in March next year, so the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, tried to pin down the parameters of what might be in the plan. Could the government offer any clue about what sort of Brexit it had in mind?

“No plan survives engagement with the enemy,” Crispin Blunt snapped. Branding the EU as the enemy before negotiations have even started may not be the best way of securing the best possible deal.

David Davis, the Brexit secretary, tried to be a little more accommodating. He had been falling over himself in the past few months to let parliament know what the government plans. It was just that no one had been listening to him. His plans were to get the best possible deal for the country once someone had got round to working out what the best possible deal was. Whatever the government managed to come up with would de facto turn out to be the best possible deal.

When Conservative Dominic Grieve pointed out that if the supreme court upheld the divisional court’s ruling on parliamentary involvement in article 50, then the government would be obliged to introduce primary legislation, Davis grandly announced: “We will obey the rule of law.” It says something for post-truth politics in 2016 that Davis managed to make that sound like a concession.

What Davis didn’t say was what the plan the government would present to the Commons would look like. Would it be a few gentle hints written on the back of an envelope? He couldn’t say for certain. Though probably it would be nothing that detailed.

Thereafter the debate rather fell apart. The Eurosceptics, once the strongest defenders of parliamentary sovereignty, were now adamant that Brexit was far too important to be left to MPs and insisted that anyone who said otherwise was just trying to thwart the will of the people. As if they had a hotline to what that will was. The remainers were equally certain that allowing the government to stumble into any old Brexit within an arbitrary timeframe was asking for trouble.

“Would anyone in this house sign up to an agreement without knowing the details?” Starmer asked. “If so, please put your hand in the air.”

Jacob Rees-Mogg put his hand up. There’s always one.

The government’s appeal against a decision granting parliament a vote on article 50 moved to the supreme court this week. And with a decision due in January, the March deadline for triggering Brexit talks is moving ever-closer.

The EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier used a speech to set out the EU’s basic starting position and to declare that the UK would not be allowed to “cherry-pick” what it wants from the single market.

We hear from the former attorney general Dominic Grieve, an ardently pro-EU Conservative MP who runs through the history of the royal prerogative.

The supreme court also heard how claims from the devolved parliaments to be involved in triggering article 50. This week the SNP has reiterated warnings that proceeding without the consent of the SNP-dominated Scottish parliament could spark a constitutional crisis. We hear from the party’s Brexit spokesman Stephen Gethins.

Plus: following Dame Louise Casey’s major review of integration in the UK, we hear from Labour MP Chuka Umunna on the policy implications of her recommendations. And joining Anushka Asthana in the studio to discuss the report are Sunder Katwala of the thinktank British Future, Phoebe Griffith from the IPPR and Shaista Gohir of the Muslim Women’s Network.

Human rights activists in Egypt have reacted angrily to the arrest of prominent women’s rights advocate Azza Soliman, saying it marked a “chilling escalation” of pressure on civil society organisations.

Soliman, the founder of the Centre for Egyptian Women’s Legal Assistance (CEWLA), is one of a number of activists, lawyers and journalists to have been prevented from leaving Egypt in the past month.

The rights lawyer and leading feminist said last week that she had been turned back on 19 November at Cairo airport. Soon after, Soliman discovered that her personal assets and those of her group had been frozen. On Wednesday, her foundation and a security source said she had been detained by police.

“The investigative judge has issued an arrest warrant against Azza Soliman,” CEWLA tweeted, adding that security forces had gone to Soliman’s house and taken her away to a Cairo police station.

There was no immediate comment from the interior ministry and it was not clear what charges, if any, Soliman was facing.

But the detention sparked immediate condemnation from Egyptian human rights activists, who say they are being subjected to a severe government clampdown targeting organisations accused of fomenting unrest during the 2011 uprising that ended Hosni Mubarak’s 30-year rule.

Several non-governmental organisations (NGOs), most involved in rights work, are embroiled in a long-running investigation, accused of receiving foreign funds to sow chaos. An Egyptian rights lawyer said Soliman’s arrest warrant had been issued by the judge who is presiding over that case.

“Why would they arrest her from her house?” asked Dalia Abdel-Hamid, a fellow women’s rights activist and researcher at the Cairo-based Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights.

“It’s so humiliating, not just for her but for all civil society and human rights activists.”

Abdel-Hamid said that in other arrests in connection with Egypt’s “foreign funding case” – the targeting of civil society organisations accused by the state of receiving “illegal” foreign funding – the accused were not taken from their homes.

“This is an aggressive step up from what has happened previously,” she added. “We don’t know what this will mean or what the repercussions of this will be.”

Soliman previously stood trial after witnessing the murder of socialist protester Shaimaa al-Sabbagh by Egyptian police in January 2015. She and 16 others were later acquitted.

Mohamed Lotfy, of the Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms, said Soliman’s arrest represented “a chilling escalation against independent civil society in Egypt”.

“Azza’s arrest unmasks the government’s animosity not just to human rights defenders in general, but also to the independent Egyptian feminist movement,” he said.

Najia Bounaim, deputy campaigns director at Amnesty International’s Tunis office, said the arrest was “the latest chilling example of the Egyptian authorities’ systematic persecution of independent human rights defenders.”

“We believe she has been arrested for her legitimate human rights work and must be released immediately and unconditionally,” she said. “Her arrest marks an escalation in the use of a string of repressive tactics designed to intimidate her and other critical voices into silence.

“There is a real risk that her arrest could signal an accelerating crackdown with many other human rights defenders subject to the same inquiry facing the risk of imminent arrest.”

In September, a court froze the assets of five prominent human rights activists and three NGOs, paving the way for criminal proceedings that could lead to life sentences.

NGOs say they have felt exposed since late 2011, when authorities raided 17 pro-democracy and rights groups. In 2013, a court ordered the closure of several foreign groups, including the US-based Freedom House, and gave jail sentences to 43 NGO staff including 15 Americans who fled.

A case against dozens of Egyptian NGOs and lawyers was never closed but remained largely dormant until this year.

In November, parliament passed a law to regulate NGOs, which human rights groups say in effect bans their work and makes it harder for development groups and charities to operate.

The bill bans domestic and foreign groups from engaging in political activities or anything that harms national security, public order, public morals or public health – a means, critics say, to stifle dissent.

Harking back to the English civil war, David Scoffield QC suggests that the UK government’s “contention of its powers are, with respect, cavalier - perhaps in this respect with both a large ‘C’ and a small ‘c’.

Senior Tory MPs have begun pushing for a list of regulations affecting companies to tear up after Brexit, even though Theresa May has promised to carry over all EU law into British law.

Two former cabinet ministers, John Whittingdale and Michael Gove, suggested to the CBI business group on Wednesday that companies should start drawing up a list of regulations they want to see abolished or reformed.

The two leave campaigners raised the prospect of EU laws being scrapped after the passage of May’s great repeal bill carrying over existing legislation, as they cross-examined witnesses at a session of the Commons committee on exiting the EU.

Gove highlighted a government-commissioned report by Marc Bolland, the former chief executive of Marks & Spencer, which ran through a list of EU employment protections it would like to see withdrawn or changed including pregnant worker proposals, the agency workers directive, the acquired rights directive and the working time directive.



Questioning Carolyn Fairbairn, the director general of the CBI, he asked her: “Would you be able to write back to the committee with a view that your members have on those directives and the current assessment for the applicability or scope for reform of those directives?”

John Whittingdale, the former culture secretary, also asked Fairburn: “To what extent has the CBI examined the opportunities which may exist to reduce the burden on business and are you working on an analysis to present to government for potential repeal or reduction?”

He said he understood the concerns of the Trade Unions Congress (TUC) that it will want to preserve protections for workers deriving from the EU but many pieces of red tape were burdensome that had nothing to do with employment.

John Longworth, the former chair of the British Chamber of Commerce, who campaigned to leave, told the committee that he thought the “opportunities for deregulation are legion”.

“Some of it will be to do with employment rights. Some of it will be to do with the fact that people might not be allowed to do overtime that they wish to do,” he said, citing lorry drivers as an example.



“But the fact of the matter is also that there is a lot of regulation that is nothing to do with employment rights that causes cost to business.” 



One example he mentioned was the EU ergonomics directive, which he said made small businesses keep a ledger of checks of the positioning of computer screens and chairs. 



He said the UK could “easily” remove 10% of EU regulations without harming workers’ rights, citing examples such as labelling rules requiring smoked salmon packets to be marked “may contain fish” and protections for newts, which are rare on the continent but common in Britain. 



However, Fairbairn cautioned MPs against focusing on “silly” anecdotal stories about overregulation, which she said were of less concern to her members than the threat of losing access to European markets.

Frances O’Grady, the general secretary of the TUC, warned the committee that a bonfire of regulations would expose British workers to a “race to the bottom” on employment conditions and health and safety protections, making the UK the “bargain basement capital of Europe”.

A full act of parliament – rather than merely a motion – would be required to give ministers authorisation to trigger Brexit, the supreme court has been told.

Concluding his arguments to the court, Lord Pannick QC, who represents the lead claimant, Gina Miller, said legislation by both houses of parliament would be needed before the government could formally give notification of the UK’s intention to leave the European Union.

“Only an act of parliament can lawfully confer power on the [government] to give notification under article 50 [of the treaty on European Union],” Pannick said. “The law is not altered by a motion in parliament. A motion in parliament cannot effect the legal issue in this case.”

On Tuesday the government’s QC, James Eadie, had indicated that any bill put before parliament would only contain a “one-line” statement.



Pannick ran into stronger judicial resistance on Wednesday when he began to assess the legal significance of the 2015 referendum legislation in terms of whether it gave the government new powers.

“It would be a bit surprising if the referendum act and the referendum had no effect in law,” Lord Neuberger, the president of the supreme court, suggested. The act may have been enough for the government to say it had ceded power to the people, he added.

But Pannick replied: “The 2015 act is entirely neutral on the issue before this court: whether or not a minister has the power to notify [Brussels that the UK intends to leave the EU].”

Dominic Chambers QC, who represents Deir Dos Santos, the second main claimant, told the court’s 11 justices that if Theresa May triggered Brexit without proper parliamentary approval she would be acting “unlawfully”.

“Parliament is supreme,” Chambers said. “No person or body can override or nullify legislation. These EU law rights [acquired through the 1972 European Communities Act] are enshrined in parliamentary legislation.

“By triggering article 50 these statutory rights will be nullified and overridden. The absence of parliamentary authorisation for the executive to override primary legislation ... will be contrary to the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty and therefore it will be acting unlawfully.”

Chambers said that the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty was “forged on the battlefields of the 17th century in the [English civil war] between crown and parliament”.

Parliament’s victory and sovereignty was finally enacted in the bill of rights which, Chambers reminded the justices, declared that “suspension of [parliamentary] powers without authority is illegal”.

A Church of England hospital chaplain has lost his claim that he was discriminated against when his licence to work was withdrawn after he married his same-sex partner, in a case that gay rights campaigners hoped would force the church to change its stance.



Jeremy Pemberton was appealing against an earlier ruling that backed the church’s legal right to enforce its position that gay clergy are forbidden from marrying their partners.

The employment appeal tribunal judge Jennifer Eady said in her ruling that the state could not impose same-sex marriage on the church.

According to the ruling, Pemberton “was aware his marriage would be seen in conflict with the teachings of the church (even if he did not accept the characterisation of those teachings as doctrine) and he would thus be viewed as not in ‘good standing’, as would be understood within the Church of England”.

It added that parliament had permitted a specific exemption to the church on discrimination claims of this nature.



In a statement after Wednesday’s decision, Pemberton said his case – brought against the bishop of Southwell and Nottingham, Richard Inwood – had raised “novel and complex issues of law”, and he may take it to the court of appeal.

He added: “The result is, obviously, not the one my husband and I had hoped for. I appreciate that this case was a source of hope for many people and I am grateful that the judge has recognised its significance and indicated that its importance warrants permission to appeal to the court of appeal.

“I am now going to take some time to consider the lengthy judgment with my husband, and we will decide on the best way forward, having taken advice from my lawyers.”

A spokesperson for the diocese of Southwell and Nottingham said: “Churches across the diocese continue to offer a generous welcome to people from all backgrounds and we remain fully engaged in the church’s exploration of questions relating to human sexuality.

“The Church of England supports gay men and women who serve as clergy in its parishes, dioceses and institutions. It has no truck with homophobia and supports clergy who are in civil partnerships, as set out in the house of bishops’ guidelines in 2006.”

Pemberton was the first C of E clergy member to enter into a same-sex marriage when he married his partner, Laurence Cunnington, in April 2014 in defiance of a church ban on same-sex weddings for clergy. Priests are permitted to enter into civil partnerships but are required to remain celibate.

The case, under the 2010 Equality Act, was seen as significant as an examination of the validity of C of E doctrine, a test of equality legislation in relation to that doctrine, and because it raised the issue of whether the church could legitimately veto appointments by other bodies – in this instance, the NHS.

After Pemberton’s wedding, Inwood revoked his permission to officiate, which prevented the chaplain from taking up a job at King’s Mill hospital in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, even though he was to be employed by the NHS.

In November 2015 Inwood argued that, according to C of E doctrine, marriage could only be between a man and a woman. The tribunal ruling said there was “no doubt whatsoever that the present doctrine of the church is clear”.

The Nottingham tribunal ruled that “the claimant would never have been in this position had he not defied the doctrine of the church. The claimant knowingly entered into that marriage and knew what the potential consequences could be for him …

“In getting married to his partner, he was flying in the face of the clear restating of doctrine in relation to same-sex marriage.”

The church has been riven by the issue of sexuality for at least two decades. A two-year consultation of clergy, congregations and members of the general synod – the church’s ruling body – was completed in the summer. Next week the house of bishops will consider next steps before the next meeting of the synod in February.



Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, has sought to hold together the global Anglican communion on this issue in a conflict between the liberal US church, which has backed same-sex marriage, and conservatives – principally from African countries – who are deeply opposed.



Welby apologised in January to lesbian, gay and transgender members of the church for the hurt caused to them. He is believed to have shifted his personal stance on the issue since becoming C of E leader almost four years ago.

Since losing his licence to officiate, Pemberton has found work as a civil celebrant, conducting weddings, funerals and naming ceremonies.



Pemberton’s appeal was heard at the employment appeals tribunal in September, with judgment handed down on Wednesday.

Labour finally flexed its muscles over Brexit on Tuesday, winning a modest concession from the government over Theresa May’s “plan”. But by signing up for No 10’s self-imposed timetable for triggering article 50, the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, also underlined how boxed in the opposition is.

Labour had tabled a motion for an opposition day debate on Wednesday, calling on the government to publish its plan for Brexit before launching the two-year EU exit process.

Facing a backbench rebellion spearheaded by Anna Soubry, the government caved in and said it would support the motion – but only if MPs accepted the end-March deadline for invoking article 50.

The Labour frontbench felt it had little choice but to accept that deal – but by Wednesday morning, some backbenchers were already sniping about Starmer’s tactics.

They resent that if they back the motion on Wednesday, they feel their hands will be tied if legislation to trigger article 50 comes to the Commons in the new year.

Labour’s room for manoeuvre is doubly limited. First, the party has repeatedly made clear that it does not want to “block Brexit”. That is because the verdict in June’s referendum was clear, but also because many of Labour’s traditional heartland areas registered a strong vote to leave.

So while the party’s official position during the referendum campaign was to remain in the EU (though the recriminations continue about whether Jeremy Corbyn campaigned hard enough), it makes little sense to hold out against Brexit altogether.

The Liberal Democrats, the most pro-EU party, were energised by the leave vote and can campaign enthusiastically against Brexit, speaking for anguished remainers.

But if Labour sought to put itself in the same territory it would risk alienating many of its traditional voters and driving a coach and horses through its already fragile electoral coalition, which involves uniting, as Andy Burnham recently said, “Hampstead and Hull”.

Secondly, even the Labour frontbench, most of whom were handpicked by Corbyn, are far from united on what sort of Brexit they would like to achieve. There is a broad-brush agreement to put safeguarding the economy before taming immigration, which Starmer, the shadow business secretary Clive Lewis and the shadow chancellor John McDonnell have all stated publicly.

Starmer has made clear he takes that to mean continued membership of the customs union and the EU single market, allowing goods to pass freely across borders.

But Corbyn has repeatedly stressed the shortcomings of the single market – not the unfettered immigration but the rules to prevent governments from backing struggling companies through state aid. He also criticised the enforcement of privatisation and liberalisation through trade deals such as the much-loathed Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership.

McDonnell has also stressed the “enormous opportunities” presented by Brexit, suggesting he would have little problem with the end of March timetable.

Some backbenchers believe Labour should have been more robust and rejected the government’s amendment on Tuesday, in effect reserving the right to throw sand in the wheels of any article 50 legislation next year (assuming the government loses the supreme court case). Chris Leslie, Ben Bradshaw, Neil Coyle and David Lammy have all said they will not support the motion.

They believe threatening to slow down the legislation unless the government fulfils certain demands is one of the few weapons at remainers’ disposal to secure the best Brexit possible. And they are irked that the government has merely committed itself to producing a Brexit plan – not a white paper or another, more formal, document.

But rejecting the amendment might be hard to reconcile with the party’s recent pronouncements about not “frustrating” Brexit, with the enthusiasm of a good proportion of its traditional voters for cracking on with leaving, and indeed with Corbyn and McDonnell’s scepticism about the benefits of the EU.

In truth, Labour is walking an all but impossible tightrope and risks shedding voters in more than one direction – to Tim Farron’s wholehearted remainers on one side and Paul Nuttall’s reinvigorated Ukip on the other. Starmer clearly believes that in those circumstances, small victories are the only kind achievable.

Malta has become the first country in Europe to ban gay conversion therapy after the parliament in Valetta unanimously approved a bill outlawing attempts to “cure” homosexuals of their sexuality.

Under the new Affirmation of Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Gender Expression Act, anyone found guilty of trying to “change, repress or eliminate a person’s sexual orientation, gender identity and/or gender expression” will face fines or a jail sentence.

Practising medical professionals who prescribe “gay cure” therapies could face fines of up to €10,000 (£8510) and a jail term of up to a year, with lesser fines of €1,000 to €5,000 and shorter sentences available to judges in other cases, Malta Today reported.

The Mediterranean island nation has launched a number of progressive social reforms since its Labour government was elected in 2013, and has twice been named the European country that best respects the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and intersex people by the advocacy group ILGA-Europe.

The new law also decrees that “no sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression constitutes a disorder, disease or shortcoming of any sort”, and lowers to 16 the age at which people can request a change in gender without their parents’ approval.

Supporters of gay conversion therapy argue it uses common psychological or counselling techniques to help people voluntarily change their sexual orientation, but the practice is widely condemned.

In Britain, the NHS, Royal College of Psychiatrists and all leading counselling and psychotherapy bodies have signed a joint statement describing it as unethical, unscientific and potentially dangerous.

According to the LGBT rights group Stonewall, a 2009 survey of 1,300 mental health professionals in the UK found that more than 200 had offered some form of conversion therapy to patients referred to them by GPs and NHS practices.

In the US, where the practice is banned on minors in several states, the American Psychiatric Association has said it opposes any treatment “based on the assumption that homosexuality per se is a mental disorder or … that a patient should change his/her homosexual orientation”.

Professional bodies representing Malta’s psychologists, psychiatrists, family therapists and counsellors welcomed the bill barring what they called an “inhumane” practice, saying in a joint statement that they were “very proud to have played an integral part” in drafting it. 



Gay conversion therapy “not only rejects a group of individuals on the basis of unfounded prejudice and lack of tolerance for diversity, but also impinges on the international recognition of LGBTIQ rights”, the associations added.

“As a body we promote respect and equality for all persons, and are determined to continue working towards ensuring our clients can enjoy as safe a therapeutic experience as they deserve,” their statement said.

Vittorio Storaro, the Oscar-winning cinematographer who supervised the filming of the “butter” scene in Last Tango in Paris, has stoutly defended the film’s director Bernardo Bertolucci, saying “nothing happened” during the shoot.

Speaking to the Hollywood Reporter, Storaro said that the recent storm over the scene – which showed Marlon Brando’s character Paul anally raping Maria Schneider’s Jeanne – was based on claims that are “not true at all”.

Storaro said: “I was there. We were doing a movie. You don’t do it for real. I was there with two cameras and nothing happened. … Nobody was raping anybody.

“I think the journalists are making an issue that is not really an issue. I read that there was a kind of violence made on her but that’s not true. That’s not true at all.”

Acknowledging that the controversy had arisen from Bertolucci’s suggestion that he had not mentioned the use of butter “as a lubricant” to Schneider before shooting the scene, Storaro said: “Probably Bernardo felt that maybe he didn’t explain it completely to Maria from the beginning and that’s why he felt a little guilty and nothing more than that. What Bernardo said later was he would like to apologise to Maria, only because he probably didn’t explain to her at the beginning what was discussed with Brando. Nothing happened during the shooting.”

He added: “[Maria] knew perfectly well what she was doing. She knew pretty well what was happening in every scene. She was an actress and had no problems with this. It was an acting job, not something else.”

Storaro, who also worked with Bertolucci on The Conformist and The Last Emperor, said the director would meet with Brando every morning while filming Last Tango to discuss the day’s work because “Brando wanted to add his own opinion”. “Everything was written down, but every morning Bernardo loved to add something … We knew the script and we knew what we wanted to do, but every morning you come up with different ideas.”

Describing the shoot as a “fantastic period”, Storaro also said that “like everybody in this wonderful atmosphere, [Schneider] was so sorry that the movie was ending.”

In later years, however, Schneider (who was 19 at the time of filming and who died in 2011) recalled a very different experience, describing Bertolucci as “very manipulative” and that she “felt a little raped, both by Marlon and by Bertolucci”.

In recent days a string of actors, including Jessica Chastain and Chris Evans, have lined up to condemn Bertolucci’s methods, but the director himself hit back, calling the controversy “ridiculous”.

Thousands of stalkers who torment their victims but whom the police do not have enough evidence to charge are to face asbo-style bans, the home secretary will announce on Wednesday.

Amber Rudd is to introduce new stalking prevention orders that will give the courts fresh powers to order offenders at an early stage not to go anywhere near someone they have been compulsively pursuing, especially in cases involving strangers.

Ministers say that as many as 1.5 million women and 830,000 men are victims of stalkers every year, yet the police recorded only 4,168 stalking offences in the 12 months to June. Even fewer – 1,102 cases – were prosecuted in the courts in 2015-16.

The introduction of the new civil stalking protection orders will enable the courts to impose restrictions on suspected stalkers, including staying away from their target, restricting their internet use, attending a rehabilitation programme or seeking treatment for mental health issues.

Breaching the conditions will be a criminal offence with a maximum sentence of five years in jail. Introducing the new orders will require legislation that ministers say they will table as soon as possible.

The Home Office said the new orders would offer additional protection at an early stage for anyone who has not been in an intimate relationship with their stalker, helping those targeted by strangers, acquaintances or colleagues, as well as professionals such as doctors who may be targeted by patients.

“Stranger stalkers” are believed to account for as many as 50% of cases, while those cases involving ex-partners are already covered by domestic violence protection orders. The National Stalking Helpline has responded to 3,550 calls so far this year.

Stalkers often delude themselves that they are in a relationship with their victim, causing distress and fear by persistently intruding on their lives through unwanted phone calls, text messages, emails or letters. This can extend in a pattern of behaviour to loitering, following and spying on their victim, ordering goods and services, as well as threats and violence.

In one extreme case, a stalker had Googled the name of his victim 40,000 times over the course of a year and had persisted in his attempts to contact his victim despite being handed three restraining orders.

However, critics fear that the orders will be used as a substitute for pursuing criminal prosecutions by poorly trained police and prosecutors unable to gather evidence. They also voiced concerns that breaches would not be rigorously enforced.

Rudd said: “Stalking can have devastating consequences, and I am determined that we do all we can to protect victims from these prolonged and terrifying campaigns of abuse that can last years, leaving many people too afraid to leave their homes and unable to get on with their lives.

“Four years ago this government created specific stalking offences to ensure those responsible face justice. Today I want to go even further and offer protection at the first signs of stalking, stopping offenders in their tracks.”

Garry Shewan, Greater Manchester police’s assistant chief constable and the National Police Chiefs’ Council lead for stalking and harassment, said: “We want to stop stalkers in their tracks. In the last year, police have recorded 32% more stalking offences and more perpetrators are now being prosecuted. The launch of stalking protection orders will help us intervene earlier and place controls on perpetrators to prevent their behaviour escalating while the crime is investigated.”

But Harry Fletcher, director of Voice4Victims, said the orders were only an interim measure to tide victims over while the police decided whether to press ahead with a prosecution. “The real issue is why there are so few prosecutions so far under the stalkings laws and why it takes so long for the police to secure evidence to prosecute,” he said. There have been just over 2,000 prosecutions since the new law came into effect in 2012.

Fletcher said what was needed was proper training for the police and prosecutors and he said the orders might become a substitute for prosecutions.

A former Royal Marine serving a life sentence for murdering a wounded Afghan insurgent faces the “real possibility” of having his conviction quashed following the presentation of new evidence, an independent review has found. 



The Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) has confirmed it is referring the conviction of Sgt Alexander Blackman, also known as Marine A, to the courts martial appeal court.

Blackman was found guilty of murder at a court martial at the military court centre, Bulford, Wiltshire, in 2013. But the presentation of new evidence relating to Blackman’s mental health at the time of the death in Helmand – and the fact that an alternative verdict of unlawful act manslaughter was not available during the trial – means the case will return to the court.

The decision marks the latest step in the fight by Blackman’s wife, Claire, to clear her husband’s name. 



David James Smith, lead CCRC commissioner on the case, said: “We have scrutinised this murder conviction in minute detail and after a thorough investigation we have concluded that there are new issues – principally relating to Mr Blackman’s state of mind at the time of the shooting – which in our view raise a real possibility that an appeal against conviction would now succeed.

“On that basis we are sending the case back to the courts martial appeal court so that a fresh appeal can be heard.”

Blackman, who was serving with Plymouth-based 42 Commando, quoted Shakespeare as he shot his victim in the chest at close range with a 9mm pistol after the Afghan had been seriously injured in an attack by an Apache helicopter.

Footage from another marine’s helmet-mounted camera showed Blackman shooting the Afghan prisoner in the chest with a 9mm pistol. 



Blackman was then heard telling him: “There you are. Shuffle off this mortal coil, you c***. It’s nothing you wouldn’t do to us.” He then turned to comrades and said: “Obviously this doesn’t go anywhere, fellas. I just broke the Geneva convention.”

During the trial, Blackman, of Taunton in Somerset, said he believed the victim was already dead and he was taking out his anger on a corpse. Two other servicemen – known as Marine B and Marine C – were acquitted of murder.

Confirmation of the CCRC decision comes after an 11-month investigation into the conviction and sentence. In a statement, the CCRC said new expert evidence had come to light, while an alternative charge was now available.

It said: “The Commission has concluded that these issues raise a real possibility that the courts martial appeal court will now quash Mr Blackman’s murder conviction.”

It will now be for the court to hear a fresh appeal and to decide the case.

Theresa May will say the Iran nuclear deal is “vitally important” in her first major intervention on the issue since the election of Donald Trump, who has said he plans to tear up the agreement secured by the Obama administration.

Speaking on Wednesday, the prime minister will tell Gulf leaders in Bahrain that Iran remains a threat to the stability of the Middle East and the UK would not ignore “aggressive” Iranian actions in Syria and Yemen.

Addressing the plenary of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) in Manama, May will say she is realistic about the threat Iran poses in the Gulf and the wider region, and prepared to “confront state actors whose influence fuels instability”.

However, the prime minister will also underline the importance of the 2015 agreement, saying it makes more direct engagement with Iran on issues of concern possible in a “clear-eyed, hard-headed manner”.

“We secured a deal that has neutralised the possibility of Iran acquiring nuclear weapons for more than a decade,” she will say. “It has already seen Iran remove 13,000 centrifuges, together with associated infrastructure, and eliminate its stock of 20%-enriched uranium.

“That was vitally important for regional security. But we must also work together to push back against Iran’s aggressive regional actions, whether in Lebanon, Iraq, Yemen, Syria or in the Gulf itself.”

Trump has threatened to scrap the deal, signed by six major powers including Britain, in which Iran agreed to scale down its nuclear programme in exchange for sanctions relief. US Republicans opposed the deal brokered by the Obama administration and called for sanctions to be increased.

In March, Trump told supporters that his number one foreign policy objective was to “dismantle the disastrous deal with Iran”, which he has since called “the worst deal ever negotiated”.

May’s comments make it clear to the US president-elect and the Iranian government that the UK would consider itself bound by the deal even if the US withdrew. Britain, along with the other signatories France, Germany, Russia and China, has resumed trade relations with Iran since sanctions were lifted.

On Tuesday, Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, said Trump could not unilaterally dismantle the deal. ”Do you think he can rip up the [deal]?” he said. “Do you think we and our nation will let him do that?”

The outgoing director of the CIA, John Brennan, has told of disastrous consequences if Trump renounces the agreement, warning that this would be the “height of folly” and any breakdown in relations could lead to a nuclear arms race with other Gulf states.

Israel, which opposes the deal, has said the terms do not prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon within the next decade. The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has said he intends to press Trump to renege on the “bad deal”.

May, who is holding bilateral meetings with six Gulf leaders during her two-day visit to Bahrain, will lead a focused session on Iran and regional security issues after the speech.

Downing Street said she would highlight key areas of concern, including the al-Quds force of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards acting in Syria to shore up the Assad regime and working with Hezbollah in Lebanon.

Although her remarks on Wednesday are likely to be interpreted as a warning to Trump not to pull the US out of the deal, May told reporters she got on well with Trump on a personal level in their two phone calls, saying he was “very easy to talk to”.

“He is someone who very much values the relationship he has with the UK,” she said.

“Whenever we’ve talked, that’s been one of the key things we’ve talked about; the depth of our special relationship and the fact we want to maintain that and build on it for the future.”

On Tuesday, May met the leaders of the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia for bilateral talks lasting roughly 30 minutes each, and dined with all six GCC leaders on Tuesday night. Downing Street sources said talks with the UAE focused on trade and investment.

Saudi Arabia’s role in the Yemen conflict was raised with King Salman, with the need for a comprehensive Saudi investigation into human rights abuses emphasised during the meeting, a source said. May will also criticise Iran’s support for Houthi rebels in the conflict in her speech on Wednesday.

“The PM said it was very important lessons are learned and acted upon,” the source said, but Downing Street did not call for an independent UN investigation into Saudi forces’ conduct in Yemen.

More than 6,800 people have been killed in the country, the majority in Saudi-led airstrikes in support of the Yemeni president, Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi.

Downing Street would not confirm whether specific cases of imprisoned or exiled dissidents in the Gulf had been raised during the talks, but she is due to have a working lunch with the king of Bahrain on Wednesday.

MPs from the all-party parliamentary group on democracy and human rights in the Gulf wrote to May on Tuesday, asking her to raise the case of Nabeel Rajab, the president of the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights, who is facing up to 15 years in prison for offences including insulting the state in an article he wrote for the New York Times.

“The European parliament, the United Nations and the US state department have all expressly called for his release from prison,” the letter said. “To date, the United Kingdom has not done likewise.”

Parliamentary legislation that paved the way for Britain to enter the EU is being treated with contempt by ministers who regard it as less important than the Dangerous Dogs Act, the supreme court has been told.

On the second day of a politically sensitive appeal that will decide whether the government or parliament has legitimate authority to trigger Brexit, the lofty neo-Tudor courtroom in Westminster was packed with teams of government officials, lawyers and the public.

Lord Pannick QC, opening the argument on behalf of the lead claimant, Gina Miller, dismissed the government’s assertion that it was entitled to use its prerogative powers to deliver notice of the UK’s intention to leave the EU under article 50 of the treaty on European Union as “inherently implausible”.

His reply to the government’s submissions came midway through the four-day hearing at the supreme court, where, because of the urgency and significance of the constitutional issues, for the first time 11 justices are sitting together to hear the case.

Miller, an investment manager, sat behind Pannick with two bodyguards as he delivered his speech. She has received death threats and abuse from internet trolls alleging she is trying to obstruct Brexit. Miller insists her claim is about ensuring that it is enacted so that parliament can have a proper debate on the process.

Pannick, an expert in constitutional law and one of the most highly paid barristers in private practice, emphasised the unique qualities of the 1972 European Communities Act, which prepared the way for Britain to join what was then the European Economic Community.

“The courts have repeatedly recognised that the 1972 act has a constitutional status,” Pannick told the justices. “It created a new source of domestic law and granted priority to it. The [government’s] argument if [followed] should mean that the act, far from having a constitutional status, would have a lesser status than that of the Dangerous Dogs Act.”

Initiating Brexit would inevitably lead to the repeal of the European Communities Act but to do so required parliament’s authority, Pannick said. Ministers alone could not do it by royal prerogative powers. “It would be … quite extraordinary that the 1972 act could be set at nought by the actions of a minister acting without any parliamentary authority,” he said.

The 1972 act was intended to create a constitutional revolution, Pannick said: “It’s inherently implausible that when it’s recognised that there’s a new source of legal rights that it could all be set at nought by prerogative powers.”

The European court of justice described the act as as “a new legal order”, Pannick said. “It’s parliament which has created this new legal order,” he went on. “When we joined the EEC what happened was that the 1972 act was brought into force before the treaty of accession was ratified.”

It made no sense, “however flexible our constitution is”, he said, “that ministers could take away what parliament had created”.

Pannick’s arguments were received with relatively few challenges from the justices. His itinerary through legal precedents included references to an 1892 dispute over lobster fishing factories in Newfoundland in which the government tried but failed to use prerogative powers to enforce an international treaty.

He outlined seven reasons why the government’s case should fail, including that the royal prerogative powers were insufficient to nullify the 1972 European Communities Act, which had a constitutional status.

Earlier, James Eadie QC, for the government, confirmed that if it lost the supreme court case, Theresa May would present a “one-line act” to parliament seeking its authorisation for triggering Brexit. The act would not provide any further detail or insight into the way the government intended to develop its negotiations with the EU, Eadie said.

He ran into criticism from several justices who accused him of confusing them over the significance of the prime minister’s promised great repeal act, which would temporarily preserve European law in UK statutes.

Eadie initially agreed that the bill was irrelevant to the issue before the supreme court, but then said it was important in as much as it demonstrated parliament was involved in debating Brexit. “You have given two diametrically opposed answers to the same question,” one of the justices, Lord Sumption, said. “We shall have to work out which one you accept.”

The evolving state of the UK’s devolution settlement will come under fresh strain on Wednesday when claimants from Northern Ireland, as well as the Scottish government, will argue that ministers cannot begin the process of departure without consulting the devolved assemblies.

Under the Sewel convention, it is claimed, the Westminster government cannot alter the rights of citizens in the devolved nations without parliamentary assent and the assent of the devolved legislatures.

Richard Keen, the Westminster government’s advocate general for Scotland, said on Tuesday that triggering article 50 would not damage the existing devolution architecture of the UK.

“It’s perfectly clear that the matter of foreign relationships, foreign affairs and our relationship with the EU is not within the competence of the devolved legislatures,” Lord Keen said.

The first law of lawyers: there’s no bad situation that can’t get worse. When James Eadie, the barrister representing the government in its supreme court appeal, had gone home the previous night, he had hoped the worst was over. He’d noticed the raised eyebrows of the 11 supreme court justices and endured their critical line of questioning. Surely now, the only way was up.

“I think you’ve just given two diametrically opposed answers to the same question in the last five minutes,” observed Lord Sumption. As Eadie, aka the Treasury Devil, had only been back on his feet for less than 20 minutes, this wasn’t the best of starts.

“We’ll have to look back through the transcripts and see which one we agree with then,” Lord Carnwath added, not altogether helpfully.

“I see,” said Lord Neuberger, trying to be kind. “We had better let you proceed with your argument.

“I will try not to give two inconsistent answers in the next five minutes,” Eadie said dolefully. He’d never wanted this appeal and just going through the same points that the divisional court had dismissed last time out was doing nothing for his self-esteem. Trying to make the best of a bad job, wasn’t his usual style.

He began to fumble and lose his way. When he reached the point of double taxation in his submissions, he just decided to give up the unequal. The justices might understand the law but he didn’t and he’d only end up giving more wrong answers. “Because of time,” he said, “I’ll pass on this.” It wasn’t quite the slam dunk finale he’d been hoping for.

Next up was Lord Keen for the Scots. Or rather not for the Scots. Scotland’s advocate general gives every impression of believing devolution has only ever been a chimera and that the Westminster parliament pulls all the strings. “I’m going through this at the rate of knots,” he said, breathless in a way that only a tortoise could ever know. Glaciers move more quickly than Lord Keen. There seems to be a significant timelapse between him having a thought and it getting uttered.

Sensing that the appeal might be running away from the government, the attorney general for Northern Ireland, John Larkin, went for the nuclear option. He dropped his bundles, and lost his place to deliver one of the more hapless performances ever witnessed by the supreme court. He rushed straight out of court as soon as his 45 minutes were up, desperate not to catch anyone’s eye. Still, his job was done. By making himself appear so useless, he might just have made Eadie and Keen look a little better.

With the government’s case – what there was of it – complete, the rest of the afternoon was handed over to Gina Miller’s barrister, Lord Pannick. Seldom has a man been less well named. Pannick exudes a sense of calm and has the uncanny ability to make you think you understand legal doublespeak even when you don’t.

A Pannick attack is a thing of zen-like beauty. He doesn’t need to shuffle his papers because he never forgets a reference. Nor does he ever miss a beat. In his hands, a legal submission is more a cosy bedside story than adversarial confrontation.

“If the government is right,” he began, “the 1972 European Communities Act has a lesser status than the Dangerous Dogs Act.”

You could see the tension ease away from the 11 justices. They knew they were safe in Pannick’s hands and whereas their line of questioning to the government’s barristers had been provocative and sharp, they now turned into gentle pussycats.

“Perhaps what you mean ... ” said one who had fallen under Pannick’s spell.

“I don’t want to be pedantic ... ” said another, apologetically.

“Your lordship is never pedantic,” Pannick replied. Killing with kindness is so much easier when you know that three divisional judges have already decided you are right and you are only looking for the supreme court to rubber-stamp their judgment.

But Pannick wasn’t going to take anything for granted. Nor was he going to forget that his primary duty was to entertain. There was only so much of international planes and conduits that anyone could take, so he moved hurriedly on to some 1892 precedent about raiding a lobster preservation factory in Newfoundland. No one thought to ask him whether it was entirely germane to the proceedings because it was all rather fun and no one dares to interrupt the master in full flow.

“The appellant has completely failed,” he concluded. The “in everything” was left unsaid but was understood by all.

“Does this play into your arguments on the 2015 act?” asked Neuberger, thinking it was about time he said something.

Like putty in his hands.

The exploitation of agency workers (Agency workers ‘exploited and forgotten’, 5 December) has even spread to the Ministry of Justice which employs court interpreters through an agency. The MoJ can book me for a full day’s work but should the case be adjourned or cancelled when I show up, I will only be paid little more than an hour’s pay, putting the cost of cancellation or curtailment on me, the interpreter. What hope is there for agency workers’ conditions if even the MoJ colludes in this bad practice?

Fifty-five minutes into his submissions and Lord Pannick QC, who represents the lead claimant Gina Miller, appears to be receiving relatively few challenges from the semi-circle of 11 justices to his developing argument.

Royal prerogative powers are not sufficient to nullify the 1972 European Communities Act which has a constitutional status, Pannick asserts.

The US supreme court on Tuesday sided with Samsung in its big-money smartphone patent fight with Apple, throwing out an appeals court ruling that said the South Korean company had to pay a $399m penalty to its American rival for copying key iPhone designs.



The justices in their 8-0 ruling sent the case back to the lower court for further proceedings.

The decision gives Samsung another chance to try to get back a big chunk of the money it paid Apple in December following a 2012 jury verdict that it infringed Apple’s iPhone patents and mimicked its distinctive appearance in making the Galaxy and other competing devices.

The court held that a patent violator does not always have to fork over its entire profits from the sales of products using stolen designs, if the designs covered only certain components and not the whole thing.

The ruling followed a ferocious legal battle between the world’s top two smartphone manufacturers that began in 2011 when Apple sued Samsung, asserting that its rival stole its technology and the iPhone’s trademarked appearance. It was one of the most closely watched patent cases to come before the top US court in recent years.

Samsung had been seeking to pare back $399m of $548m it paid Apple in December following a 2012 jury verdict finding that it infringed Cupertino, California-based Apple’s iPhone patents and copied its distinctive appearance.

After a trial in 2012, Apple was awarded nearly $930m in damages. The US court of appeals for the federal circuit in Washington, in May 2015, upheld the patent infringement verdict but said the iPhone’s appearance could not be protected through trademarks. That cut Samsung’s damages back by $382m.

The legal dispute centered on whether the term “article of manufacture” in US patent law should be interpreted as a finished product in its entirety, or merely a component in a complex product.

In court papers, Samsung, Apple and the US government all agreed that the term could mean a component.

But Apple urged the supreme court to affirm the appeals court’s ruling because Samsung presented no evidence that the article of manufacture in this case was anything less than its entire smartphone as sold. Samsung, meanwhile, said that it did not have to present such evidence.

Justice Sonia Sotomayor, writing for the unanimous court, said that the patent law is clear. The term “article of manufacture is broad enough to encompass both a product sold to a consumer as well as a component of that product”, she wrote.

Samsung in December 2015 paid Apple $548m. But it took the matter to the supreme court, saying it should not have had to make $399m of that payout for copying the patented designs of the iPhone’s rounded-corner front face, bezel and colorful grid of icons that represent programs and applications.

Apple said its iPhone’s success was tied to innovative designs, which other manufacturers quickly adopted in their own products. Samsung in particular made a deliberate decision to copy the iPhone’s look and many user interface features, Apple said.

Samsung argued that it should not have had to turn over all its profits on phones that infringed iPhone design patents, saying those elements contributed only marginally to a complex product with thousands of patented features.

With the products that used iPhone designs, Samsung went on to become the world’s top smartphone maker.

The supreme court heard arguments in the case on 11 October.

Design patent fights very rarely reach the supreme court. It had not heard such a case in more than 120 years.

After he took the role of international trade secretary, Fox boasted that he would have “about a dozen free trade deals outside the EU” ready for when Britain left. But it is illegal for Britain, as an EU member state, to negotiate bilateral trade deals. Fox later quietly backtracked on his promise. No one knows what he’s doing with his time at the moment.

In a speech at the Conservative party conference, May promised that Britain would now control how it labels food. But these rules have nothing to do with the EU. They come from a general code at the World Trade Organisation (WTO). For May to deliver on this promise, she would have to adopt the North Korean model of total isolation. She either didn’t know what she was saying was nonsense, or didn’t care.

If you want to sell pharmaceuticals in Europe, they have to have been cleared by European regulators. While we’re in the EU, that’s the case for the UK too. But what happens after we leave? Will a British regulator take up the slack? A fast, hard Brexit of the type being demanded by some Tory MPs would leave a window between leaving the EU and setting up our own regulators. During that period, drug firms wouldn’t be able to get their products authorised for the UK market, so, for a while, there would be no new eczema creams, asthma inhalers or any other new treatments available to British patients.

Directors of trade bodies – many of them facing economic and regulatory disaster – went in to brief David Davis when he was made Brexit secretary. But before they got to his office they were taken to one side by civil servants and advised to go in saying Brexit was full of “opportunities”. Anyone who didn’t tended to be asked to leave after five minutes.

If there’s one thing everyone accepts the Brexit vote demonstrated, it’s that people want to end freedom of movement. Except this isn’t true. Poll after poll taken during and after the campaign found that between 20% and 40% of leave voters either support immigration or prioritise the economy over reducing it – or just want to remain in the single market.

Or at least we didn’t when we voted to leave Europe. Whitehall is now on a massive recruitment drive. We urgently need an army of general trade experts and ones with specialist knowledge in areas such as intellectual property law. The costs are painfully high. Some are quoting day rates of £3,000 to do consultancy work for the UK government. If they are hired full-time, their salaries will be lower – probably around the £100,000 mark.

City bankers don’t have time to sit around waiting to find out what May’s Brexit plan is. In order to avoid losing passporting rights in Europe, they have to register an office with regulators on the continent – a process that could take years. They are therefore likely to make “no regret” decisions, meaning they will do things they wanted to do anyway. In this case, that means moving back-office administrative staff to locations with cheaper rents and lower salaries, such as Warsaw. The less you earn, the more likely you are to be affected.

Brexiters argue that if we don’t get a good deal from the EU, we can fall back on WTO rules. They couldn’t be more wrong. The EU is a member of the Geneva-based WTO too. If the UK tries to unilaterally separate its trade arrangements from the EU without getting its agreement first, Brussels can trigger a trade dispute. For Britain to secure a decent relationship with the WTO, it needs to make sure it is on good terms with the EU.

If Britain does pursue a hard Brexit, things get murky. There are no rules on how an existing WTO member leaves a customs union, because no one has ever been crazy enough to try it. Lawyers at the organisation are trying to sort out how this works and what the process will be.

If Britain is to going to ensure stability during its transition from the EU to independent membership of the WTO, it will have to replicate all the EU’s tariffs (charges on imports and exports). This makes a mockery of everything Brexit stands for, of course, but if we changed any tariff, it would trigger an avalanche of trade disputes and lobbying operations. If Britain was to raise tariffs on ham, for instance, it would trigger protests and formal dispute claims from not just European ham producers, but those all over the world.

There’s an EU agreement at the WTO preventing China from dumping cheap steel in Europe. Without it, plants such as Port Talbot would collapse as Chinese product flooded the market. When Britain leaves the EU, it will claim that it is still a signatory to this agreement and the Chinese will object. This dispute is likely to last for years. If Britain loses, it will likely lose its domestic steel industry.

Ministers want to transfer all EU laws into Britain using the so-called great reform bill. The trouble is, they don’t know where to find them. The Equalities Act, for instance, is a messy mixture of EU and UK legislation. In every area of law, there are bits and pieces of EU directives. Good luck tracking them all down.

Leaving the EU involves three things: an administrative divorce, the untangling of British and EU law, and (probably) a new trade deal. But only the first aspect is dealt with in article 50. The rest is up to Europe’s discretion. If they want to just talk admin, we can’t do much about it.

If European countries don’t like the way article 50 talks go, they could decide to not recognise legal decisions from London. At a snap, British divorcees who live in Europe would suddenly find themselves in a state of marital limbo – with their home country recognising their divorced status, but their adopted country considering them married.

Britain and Ireland enjoy legal protections against EU immigration law which allow them to “continue to make arrangements between themselves relating to the movement of persons between their territories”. This should prevent Brussels imposing a hard border for people in Ireland. But there are no protections against tabloid scare stories. After Brexit, we can expect campaigns about Polish plumbers crossing into England from Ireland to work. It will be nonsense – Polish people could just as easily use tourist visas – but it could be politically effective. If a hard border returns to Ireland, it will be because of Britain, not the EU.

Leaving the single market will sever Britain’s relationship with its largest trading destination, but the problems don’t end there. Europe also has agreements with other major economies such as the US and Japan allowing it to transport goods without expensive and slow border checks. If Britain leaves the single market, we’ll lose these too. Oops.

A bilateral trade deal with the US would see cheaper burgers in the UK. The Americans have lower animal-welfare standards, use growth hormones in their meat and have larger farms. This won’t be good news for British farmers, who will also be facing sky-high export tariffs and a possible end to subsidies. And it won’t be good news for animal rights campaigners. But burger lovers might be pleased.

EU law insists on an independent veterinary presence in abattoirs. The problem is that 95% of the vets doing this job in Britain are European – most of them from Spain. The problem is one of demand. British vets study for years to cure family pets, not watch cows being slaughtered. But Europeans have less of a cultural hang-up about that type of thing and are also willing to accept the lower wages involved. If Britain doesn’t train up more domestic vets for the abattoirs, it won’t be able to sell meat to Europe or properly check it for disease.

British fishermen want the UK to prise open the incredibly complex European system for allocating national quotas of fish stocks and renegotiate the whole thing. That will take a long time and a lot of manpower. If they get it wrong, the UK could face problems. The type of white meat we like for fish and chips doesn’t actually come from the UK – most of it comes from the seas around Norway and Iceland.

The Americans have lower consumer standards than Europe on pretty much everything, from chemical safety to data protection. A bilateral trade deal will see them demand we lower our standards so their products can enter our market more freely. Given how desperate we’ll be, we’re likely to comply.

Brexit: What the Hell Happens Now? by Ian Dunt (Canbury) is out now

The Guardian revealed on Tuesday that the Ministry of Justice had been told that the restraint techniques it had approved for use on children in custody could kill them. A risk assessment carried out by an independent medical adviser concluded that 28 of the 66 sanctioned restraints had a 40% to 60% chance of resulting in injuries involving the airway, breathing or circulation that could have catastrophic consequences – catastrophic being defined as “death or permanent severe disability affecting everyday life”. It also revealed that many restraints are likely to result in so called “minor” or “moderate” injuries – such as fractures/dislocations and ligament/tendon damage.

As well as explicitly chronicling the dangers we are subjecting our children in custody to, the risk assessment table demonstrates another important truth – that bad practice in secure training centres (STC) and young offender institutions (YOI) does not begin and end with G4S, or whichever private security firm is running them. The government itself is responsible for the appalling abuses carried out in the name of restraint because, quite simply, it sanctioned them in the first place.

When Panorama and the Guardian exposed dangerous restraint techniques used in a children’s prison run by G4S earlier this year, there were howls of outrage from the prison establishment. First, Panorama secretly filmed a boy being squeezed by his windpipe by a guard in Medway secure training centre shouting out that he couldn’t breathe. Then the Guardian spoke to two women who had been detainees at Medway five years earlier who also said that they struggled to breathe while being restrained. A number of guards have been charged with misconduct in public office and taking photographs inside the prison.

Soon enough, the Ministry of Justice and the Youth Justice Board, which oversees the safety and security of children in detention, appeared to conclude that G4S itself was the bad apple. Having ordered the company to come up with an improvement plan to prove it was fit to run the STC, in May it announced that the private security company would be stripped of the Medway contract, and that the government would take over its running.

In its final report, the Medway improvement board concluded that Medway’s leadership team “has driven a culture that appears to be based on control and contract compliance rather than rehabilitation and safeguarding vulnerable young people”. It also suggested that official figures on restraint could not be believed because of the allegation that they were being falsified downwards to ensure that G4S complied with its contract.

The damning report was perfectly fair. G4S could not have made a bigger botch of running Medway. (In 2015 it also lost the contract to run Rainsbrook STC after a joint report by Ofsted, the Care Quality Commission and the chief inspector of prisons into the centre condemned it for a series of failings.) But what the Medway improvement board never acknowledged was the government’s role in nurturing this culture.

Perhaps this is unsurprising. After all, until the risk-assessment table was obtained through one of the many freedom of information requests made by the indefatigable children’s rights campaigner Carolyne Willow, we never knew that the government had been advised by an medical expert that its restraints could result in catastrophic injuries. Or to take one particular example, there is a 60% chance of a child being moved through a doorway while being restrained and wearing a waist restraint belt suffering injuries involving the airway, breathing or circulation that can be potentially catastrophic.

The irony is that this relatively new restraint regime, known as Minimising and Managing Physical Restraint (MMPR) was only introduced in 2012 as a result of the death of two boys in secure training centres following restraints. (Fifteen-year-old Gareth Myatt choked on his vomit while being restrained by three officers; 14-year-old Adam Rickwood hanged himself after being restrained by four staff, one of whom inflicted a painful restraint on him known “nose distraction”.) MMPR was supposed to be more humane and safe. So what did the government do when it discovered that it wasn’t? It classified the risk-assessment table and heavily redacted the MMPR manual that is publicly available, concluding with absurd Kafkaesque logic that if everything about MMPR was publicly known, children would learn how to resist it and put themselves at more risk of being harmed.

For four years, Willow has fought, unsuccessfully, to see the uncensored manuals. In refusing her most recent request, the MoJ wrote: “It is considered that on balance, the likely threat to the good order and security of YOIs and prisons and the safety implication of this for young people and staff in both YOIs and prisons favours non-disclosure of the unredacted version of the MMPR training manual.”

When we approached the Youth Justice Board about the risk-assessment table, and the fact that it had only praised MMPR without mentioning the dangers, there was much off-the-record handwringing. What’s the option, it asked; tell us if a better system exists?

So we did. One better system already exists in England and Wales. Secure children’s homes are run by local authorities rather than the MoJ, and they house some of the country’s most severe child offenders as well as some of the country’s most vulnerable non-criminal children. MMPR is banned in secure children’s homes (yet shockingly private security guards taking children to and from them can use it). They are expensive to run, but have low children to staff ratios, are learning-focused and are regarded as the closest this country has to model institutions for children in custody.

Meanwhile, Spain offers an even more impressive model. In 2014 we visited children’s prisons in Spain run by a non-profit organisation Diagramma. Some of the buildings we saw were frankly terrifying – old-fashioned Victorian prisons surrounded by barbed wire. But the attitude of staff within them could not be more different to that too often found in the YOIs and STCs of England and Wales. In Spain, the prison officers are called educators, they all have degrees, are relatively well paid, and all have the children’s best interests at heart. There were guards on site, but they were rarely called to action. The educators and detainees called each other by first names, ate with each other and treated each other with respect. Love, even. Whereas there is an alarmingly fast turnover of staff in children’s prisons in the UK, in Spain we were told that staff rarely left.

We asked the director of one institution we visited when restraint had last ended in injury, and he looked at us as if we were mad. Never, was the answer. In fact, he could not remember the last time restraint had been used, full stop. The way in which the staff in these prisons transformed dangerous and feckless youths into responsible young adults looking forward to a bright future was astonishing. If Spain can achieve something so miraculous, there is no reason why we can’t.

The justice secretary, Liz Truss, has ordered the rapid completion of an official review into the failing performance of the government’s privatisation of the probation service.

Truss told MPs that the review into the privatised probation companies’ performance introduced by her predecessor Chris Grayling would be completed by April and would include a major overhaul as well as measures to improve the service.

The announcement comes after highly critical reports by the chief inspector of probation, Dame Glenys Stacey, that found companies were struggling to deliver the supervision of 250,000 offenders a year.

Tory MP Bob Neill, who chairs the justice select committee, has said probation service “risks heading for a car crash” and the 21 community rehabilitation companies have reported they are making a loss on almost all their seven-year contracts worth £3.7bn.

Truss told the House of Commons on Tuesday: “Our probation officers do a vital job in turning offenders’ lives around. The prisons and probation minister is conducting a comprehensive review of the probation system focused on improving the quality of our probation services.

“As with our plans for prisons we want a simpler, clearer system with specific outcome measures such as getting offenders off drugs, improving educational standards and getting offenders into apprenticeships and work.

“We also want to see closer working with the prison service. We will set out our more detailed plans after our review is completed in April.”

A joint review by the chief inspectors of probation and prisons into the performance of the part-privatisation of the probation service in June identified multiple failings in “through the gate” services, including the release from prison of one in three offenders without anywhere to live and no one in a sample of 86 offenders being given help in training, education or employment.

The probation service was split in 2014 into 21 community rehabilitation companies, supervising medium- to low-risk offenders, and a public National Probation Service (NPS), supervising high-risk offenders.

The “transforming rehabilitation” revolution, as it was dubbed, was introduced by Grayling when he was justice secretary. It included a pledge to provide supervision for the first first time for 50,000 short-term prisoners on their release without any significant extra funding.

Stacey said last month that while the caseloads for the NPS were climbing, the companies’ caseloads were much lower than anticipated and they were supervising between 6% and 36% fewer offenders with a consequential loss of income. Many companies were considering whether they could continue to afford their current staffing levels. Very little innovative work was going on.

The justice secretary also confirmed she was considering a new specific offence of prison corruption after the disclosure of Ministry of Justice (MoJ) figures that showed a sharp increase in the number of staff working for prison contractors excluded for alleged smuggling.

The figures, released after a freedom of information request this year, showed the number of prison officers convicted, cautioned or dismissed for corruption over the last five years had remained relatively stable at 40 to 50 a year.

But at the same time the number of other staff, mainly contractors, excluded from jail in connection with corruption allegations, such as smuggling drugs or other contraband, had risen from 40 in 2010 to 110 in 2015.

A joint Metropolitan police and prison service investigation in 2006 suggested as many as 1,000 prison officers at that time were involved in corruption that ranged from accepting cash bribes to drug smuggling. At the same time, a corruption investigation into Pentonville prison in London led to the suspension of 14 staff.

An MoJ spokesperson said: “The vast majority of our prison staff are hard-working and honest, but we remain vigilant to the threat posed by corruption. We take swift action against the small minority who involve themselves in corruption, and those who put fellow members of prison staff in harm’s way will face the full force of the law.

“We have set out a range of measures in the recent prison safety and reform white paper to bolster our response to tackling this issue. These include closer working with the police, investing £3m in a new intelligence unit and developing a new corruption strategy in the new year. We are also considering options for the creation of a prison-specific offence of corruption.”

One could be forgiven for wondering what the Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain (IWGB) – a small trade union that represents mainly low-paid migrants and workers in the “gig economy” and relies on crowdfunding to help finance its initiatives – is doing intervening in the UK’s most important court case in recent history.

The starting point for understanding why the IWGB has an interest in the Brexit case is this: the UK leaving the EU represents potentially the biggest assault on workers’ rights and migrants’ rights in a generation. Indeed it is difficult to overstate the degree to which working people depend on employment law that originates in Brussels.

To name just a few examples: your right to paid holiday; your right not to be discriminated against because of your age or sexual orientation; your right not to be sacked or have your wages reduced when a company buys out your employer; your right to be consulted when your employer wants to make you and your co-workers redundant; protection against unfavourable treatment towards you if you work part-time; and equal pay for men and women.

To get just a taste of what the removal of these rights would mean for our members, four of our (British) couriers are bringing an employment status test case which would now fall apart because it relies on legislation that comes from the EU.

Similarly, two IWGB reps elected to represent University of London employees (the majority of whom are British) would no longer serve a purpose because they were elected through legislation that also originates in EU law. And our security guard members, who tend to work 12-hour shifts, could be stripped of their legal right to rest breaks.

To say that the government will simply keep or reintroduce all these rights into British law – as unlikely as this is – rather misses the point. The importance of EU employment law is not just that in some instances it introduced rights that did not exist in the UK before; it’s also that for as long as the UK subscribes to EU law, current and future rightwing UK governments, in the name of austerity or whatever other wrongheaded ideology they are pushing, can’t undo these protections. And EU courts tend to interpret the laws more favourably for workers than UK courts do. These protections for workers are a fundamentally good thing, and the IWGB opposes any attempt to remove them.

In terms of migrants’ rights, the EU’s free movement of labour principle has allowed hundreds of our members to come and work here after having lost everything in the economic crisis in Spain. Free movement has allowed others to come to London from central Europe in order to work for courier companies. As far as our members go, these migrant workers have not driven down wages but on the contrary, have left their jobs better than they found them.

Spanish-citizen cleaners at the University of London led a campaign that saw the introduction of some of the best wages and terms and conditions for cleaners in the UK. Likewise central European couriers have contributed to campaigns that resulted in pay increases of 17%-28% in the UK’s biggest same-day delivery companies. Free movement has allowed our members to enjoy a better life, it has allowed them to bring their families over, and it has allowed them to contribute to improving pay, terms and conditions for their British co-workers. The IWGB opposes any restrictions on the current free-movement arrangements.

So is the IWGB trying to block Brexit? No. But nor do we think Theresa May should be given free reign to implement the hard Brexit she thinks will get her re-elected in 2020. Before the prime minister potentially upends four decades of employment rights and turns upside down the lives of more than 3 million EU citizens, we believe there should be as much scrutiny and input from elected officials as possible. And we hope that that scrutiny and input will result in strong protections for workers’ rights and will avoid the temptation to restrict free movement.

A common accusation against anyone in favour of free movement is that they are undermining democracy because the referendum result clearly reflected a desire to rein in immigration. The problem with reducing an extremely complex and multi-faceted issue into a binary choice is that it is nigh impossible to know for sure what a vote means. Of course some people voted to come out of Europe over immigration. Others voted to reject globalisation and free trade (yet the defining feature of the government’s public comments on Brexit is the extent to which it wants to make the UK a leader in free trade). Others voted to come out in protest against an establishment position that united leaders of all mainstream political parties, the governor of the Bank of England, the IMF and the US president. And others did so because they were told it would bring home £350m a week for the NHS. I also know plenty of people on the left who voted for Brexit because of how poorly the EU had treated Greece and refugees.

Finally, for some voters “immigration” is little more than a proxy for concerns over low wages, job insecurity, insufficient housing and strained public services. I don’t think millions of workers across England and Wales purposely voted to deprive themselves of holidays. And given that no amount of EU migrants could do as much to increase job insecurity and drive down terms and conditions as the removal of EU employment law, we should focus on where the danger really lies.

Perhaps the best way to put into perspective what the IWGB is doing getting involved in this case is to think about what Ukip would have done if it had lost the referendum. Would the party whose raison d’etre was to achieve Brexit simply have closed up shop and told its voters to go back to voting Tory or BNP or whatever it is they did before? I don’t think so. It would have continued to bang on about Europe and migrants until the cows came home. And as the sole trade union involved in one of the most important cases for workers in a generation, the IWGB will continue to bang on about workers’ rights and migrants’ rights, with as loud a megaphone as we can find, using every legal and democratic means available to us.

Parliament will gain new and extensive controls over the conduct of foreign policy if the supreme court rejects ministers’ right to use the royal prerogative to trigger Brexit, a government lawyer has told judges.

Addressing the 11 justices on the second day of the article 50 hearing, James Eadie QC denied that the government was seeking to undermine parliamentary sovereignty.

Eadie said the ruling by the high court last month – that parliament alone has legitimate authority to give notice under article 50 of the treaty on European Union of the UK’s withdrawal from the EU – would have damaging consequences.

“The reasoning of the conclusion of the [high] court has the most serious implications for the long-established use of the [government’s] foreign affairs prerogative,” Eadie said.

If the high court’s judgment against the government stands, Eadie alleged, then a new restriction on the government’s executive freedom in foreign affairs will have been created.

“It would introduce a much more stringent stream of control [by parliament through] a newly discovered principle,” Eadie said. “You would need primary legislation [to sign international treaties or other overseas developments].”

Turning to government plans for passing legislation for triggering Brexit through parliament, if it loses the supreme court case, Eadie said that it would involve a “one-line act”. The act would not provide any further detail or insight into the way the government intends to develop its negotiations with the EU, Eadie said.

Lord Keen, the Westminster government’s advocate general for Scotland, said that triggering article 50 would not damage the existing devolution architecture of the UK. “It’s perfectly clear that the matter of foreign relationships, foreign affairs and our relationship with the EU is not within the competence of the devolved legislatures,” he said.

He was addressing the supreme court before representations from Welsh and Scottish government lawyers, who will argue that under the Sewel convention the Westminster government cannot alter the rights of the citizens in the devolved nations without parliamentary assent and the assent of the devolved legislatures.



The role of the government’s great repeal bill came up at the start of the day’s hearing. “It’s valuable to know that it has no great legal significance,” Lord Sumption, one of the justices, said.

Lord Wilson, another justice, intervened: “So you say it’s irrelevant?”

Eadie, for the government, initially agreed but then said it was significant in as much as parliament was involved in debating Brexit.

“You have given two diametrically opposed answers to the same question,” Sumption said. “We shall have to work out which one you accept.”

A former militia leader from northern Uganda has denied committing war crimes including rape and murder, on the opening day of his trial at the international criminal court at The Hague, saying that as a child soldier taken by force from his home by the organisation he was a victim of its atrocities, not a perpetrator.



Dominic Ongwen, once a feared commander of the Lord’s Resistance Army, told judges in a dramatic outburst that he was “one of the people against whom the LRA committed atrocities”. He said: “In the name of God, I deny all these charges.”

The trial of is one of the most momentous in the ICC’s 14-year history, and raises difficult questions of responsibility and blame. Ongwen, who is between 35 and 40 years old, is the first former child soldier to face trial at the controversial institution and the first defendant to be both alleged perpetrator and victim of the same crimes.

Ongwen was abducted by the LRA at the age of 10 when returning from school and is thought to have been forced to participate in combat and violent acts against civilians as a child. He told the court he should not be on trial.

“I am not the LRA … It is the LRA who abducted people in northern Uganda. It is the LRA who killed people,” Ongwen said, speaking through an interpreter.

A court official needed almost 20 minutes to read the 70 charges against Ongwen. They included murder, attempted murder, torture, rape, sexual slavery and, for the first time, “forced pregnancy” and “forced marriage”.

Led by Joseph Kony, a former rebel leader who claimed to be religiously inspired, the LRA waged war across five countries in east and central Africa for nearly 30 years.

The group has been blamed for the deaths of about 100,000 people and the abduction of 60,000 children. It relied on the abduction of largely defenceless villagers and refugees, including children, to provide labour and combatants. Girls were forced into sexual and domestic slavery while boys were forced to commit atrocities and conditioned to believe such acts were necessary and justified.

Most of the charges against Ongwen focus on a series of attacks on refugee camps between 2002 and 2005. One of the worst involved a four-day raid by the LRA on camps in north-eastern Congo in December 2009, in which about 350 civilians were killed and another 250, including at least 80 children, were abducted.

Defence lawyers will argue that much of the evidence against Ongwen is unreliable and say their client was brutalised and traumatised after being abducted.

“He was tortured … forced to watch people being killed, used for fighting as a child soldier. Even the prosecution have said that what he went through is a serious mitigating factor,” said Thomas Obhof, a US lawyer based in Uganda and part of the defence team.

Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda told the court that past victimisation as a child might be a mitigating factor in sentencing but was not a defence of Ongwen’s alleged decision to “wholeheartedly” embrace violence.

“Ongwen was directly involved in many attacks on civilians … He knew that the crimes he committed were part of widespread and systematic attacks … He played a crucial role in …. the abduction of children in order to maintain the fighting strength of the LRA,” she told the court.



Bensouda said eyewitnesses remembered Ongwen giving orders “to bite and stone an old man to death” and cited evidence that the majority of the children in Ongwen’s “battalion” were young teenagers who were regularly forced to participate in torture and murder “to convince them there could be no acceptance for them back in society”.

Charge number 69 against Ongwen involved the alleged conscription of children under the age of 15 into an armed group, while charge number 70 alleged the use of children as combatants in an armed group between July 2002 and December 2005.

Ledio Cakaj, the author of When the Walking Defeats You, a book that documents the experiences of a bodyguard to the LRA leader, Kony, said the trial raised “a very tricky issue”. He said: “A lot of these people of the LRA, who are considered as the bad guys, were in some sense victims in the first place … There are very interesting questions here.”

The LRA is now believed to comprise only about 100 fighters, but remains feared by civilians in remote communities and an inspiration to other militia groups, which have copied its brutal methods. Every week brings reports of continuing attacks.

Of the five senior LRA leaders indicted by the ICC 11 years ago, only Ongwen and his former leader, Kony, are still alive. Despite a $5m (£3.5m) reward for information leading to his capture, Kony remains elusive.

Africa is still wracked by militia groups and militant outfits. Cakaj said that even though the trial dealt with events that occurred a decade or more ago it would raise issues that were relevant now.

Boko Haram, the Nigeria-based Islamist extremist organisation, has abducted tens of thousands of men and women, with some taking up combat roles or even launching suicide attacks.

“The issues are important today … Any lessons can be applied to ongoing conflicts [in Africa] too,” Cakaj said.

The case is crucial for the ICC, too. Huge resources have been invested in building a case against the LRA leaders, whose arrest warrants were the first issued by the court.

The ICC, founded in 2002 to bring to justice perpetrators of crimes that local criminal systems cannot deal with, has been criticised in Africa by some who see it as a racist, imperialist institution. Nine out of the 10 cases being investigated by the ICC involve alleged crimes in Africa, and recent months have seen South Africa, the Gambia, and Burundi announce their withdrawal from the court. It is possible, however, that none will leave, especially since elections in the Gambia ousted Yahya Jammeh.

In September, the court convicted Ahmad al-Faqi al-Mahdi, who pleaded guilty to razing medieval shrines, tombs and a 15th-century mosque that formed part of the Unesco world heritage site in Timbuktu, Mali, when the city was seized by Islamic militants in 2012. Mahdi was sentenced to nine years in prison.

Defenders say the majority of the investigations have followed an explicit request or grant of jurisdiction from the government in the country where the crimes were committed, as in the case of Uganda; while others say criticism of the institution came when it started investigating acts that had been committed by current rulers or their close associates from 2009.

Thousands in Uganda are watching the Ongwen trial in The Hague on screens set up by the ICC at viewing sites in the four locations where the most significant alleged crimes were committed. The trial has been hailed by human rights campaigners.

“The ICC trial of Dominic Ongwen is a significant first on justice for LRA atrocities,” said Elise Keppler, associate international justice director at Human Rights Watch. “The LRA leadership is reviled worldwide for its brutality against Africans, but never before has an LRA commander faced trial.”

My husband, Mohammed Ramadan, is due to be executed in Bahrain any day now. Our three young children are distraught. We want Theresa May, the British prime minister, to call for Mohammed to be released when she meets Bahraini leaders today on her Gulf visit. Our criminal justice system has failed him and the British government, which supports that system, has failed him too.

In 2014 Mohammed was arrested at Bahrain’s airport where he worked as a police officer. My husband believes in human rights, democracy and transparency. He attended peaceful marches in Bahrain calling for our government to respect these values. As a state employee, he knew that it was risky for him to go to these protests. But he believes in reform and so he went anyway.

After Mohammed was taken into custody, our family heard nothing for four days – we had no idea where he was, or even if he was alive. Eventually, two weeks later, we were allowed to see him, but only with three guards watching us on a surveillance camera. As soon as we saw him, it was clear that Mohammed had been tortured by the security services.

Mohammed seemed weak and exhausted, and his body was trembling; this suggested to us that he had been subjected to extreme torture. But no one would tell us the reasons for his arrest or the charges against him.

Later, he told us what they had done to him. They had detained him, naked and humiliated, in a freezing cold cell. They had beaten him. They had forced him to stand for days on end. They had electrocuted him. They had sexually assaulted him. They had made him listen to the screams of other prisoners being tortured. They had threatened to rape me and other members of our family in front of him.

Their aim was to punish Mohammed for his participation in the pro-democracy protests by getting him to confess to a crime he did not commit. Eventually, Mohammed and his co-defendants signed false “confessions” to make the torture stop. Mohammed was not allowed to see or speak to his lawyer until after his trial had started. He was convicted on the basis of his forced confession, even though he had recanted it. This “evidence” – which would immediately be thrown out of any court in Britain – is the reason that my beloved husband and the father of my children is facing imminent execution.

Shortly after my husband’s arrest, I submitted a complaint about his mistreatment to my country’s UK-trained ombudsman, who is meant to investigate such allegations. An international human rights organisation submitted a torture complaint, too. But the ombudsman conducted no investigation for more than two years, even as Mohammed was sentenced to death.

Then this year, following intense pressure on the UK Foreign Office by human rights groups such as Reprieve and the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy, the ombudsman agreed to open a new investigation. I’ve been told that this investigation is now closed, but I know very little about its outcome. Furthermore, the Foreign Office has not yet called for his release.

Sadly, my husband is not alone. In the past two years judges have handed down eight death sentences, including my husband’s. Many of these people have been convicted on the basis of confessions extracted through torture. The Bahrain government regularly strips its political opponents of their citizenship and sentences peaceful human rights activists to decades in prison.

Throughout this time, the UK government has championed Bahrain’s supposed human rights reforms, spending millions coaching a torture watchdog, training hundreds of guards at the death-row jail where he is held, and secretly assisting Bahrain’s police, who continue to torture peaceful protesters.

The only result of all of this that I have seen is that my husband remains in prison, facing execution for a crime he didn’t commit – while the people who tortured him still walk free.

United Nations human rights experts are demanding answers from Beijing over the disappearance of a prominent Chinese lawyer they fear has been targeted by authorities in reprisal for meeting a UN official earlier this year.

Jiang Tianyong, a 45-year-old Christian lawyer known for defending a number of prominent human rights activists, has not been seen since 21 November. Relatives and supporters believe he has been taken into secret custody by security forces.

Jiang’s unexplained disappearance comes amid what appears to be a fresh wave of detentions targeting Chinese activists.

Human rights groups say that more than 250 activists, lawyers and their relatives have been detained or interrogated as part of a sweeping crackdown labelled China’s “war on law” that began in July 2015.

In a statement released on Tuesday by the office of the UN high commissioner for human rights in Geneva, the group said it suspected Jiang had become one of the latest victims of that campaign: “We cannot rule out the possibility that Jiang may have been disappeared by state agents because of his human rights work.

The UN experts noted that as a result of his longstanding human rights work Jiang has been repeatedly targeted by Chinese police and agents from its powerful spy agency, the ministry of state security, which is tasked with tackling political threats to the Communist party.

“We fear that Jiang’s disappearance may be directly linked to his advocacy and he may be at risk of torture,” said the statement. 



Philip Alston, the UN’s special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, said he was “deeply concerned that Jiang’s disappearance has occurred, at least in part, in reprisal for his cooperation with the UN during my visit to China”. 



Alston conducted a nine-day fact-finding mission in August, telling reporters in Beijing that President Xi Jinping’s crackdown on dissent risked causing mass unrest. 



“The international standards are clear: states must refrain from and protect all persons from acts of reprisal,” Alston said on Tuesday of Jiang’s disappearance.

The UN representative claimed others he met during his trip to China were also subjected to apparent reprisals. “Governments must provide assurance that no persons will suffer intimidation, threats, harassment or punishment … for their cooperation with the UN experts.”

The statement, which also has the backing of Michel Forst, the special rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, and David Kaye, the special rapporteur on freedom of expression, came as activists said Li Heping, one of the most prominent Chinese lawyers caught up in last year’s clampdown, had been indicted on unknown charges.

Li has not been heard from and has been deprived of all contact with his family since he was taken from his Beijing home on 10 July 2015. He is expected to be tried in the coming weeks.

Eva Pils, a King’s College London scholar who knows Li, said she believed her friend was being denied independent legal counsel.

“The authorities claim that Li Heping has appointed his own lawyers and dismissed the family-appointed ones,” she said. “This is wholly unconvincing.”

Pils said Li’s wife and the spouses of other jailed lawyers continued to be subjected to “all kinds of reprisals merely for trying to find out what is happening to their husbands”.

The German press agency DPA reported that French and German diplomats had been summoned by Chinese authorities after their governments honoured Li’s wife, Wang Qiaoling, with a human rights prize recognising her “tireless dedication to representing the families of lawyers and activists held in China”.

In response, French and German officials called for Li’s immediate release, “in accordance with the rule of law, as set out in the Chinese constitution”.

A former militia leader who took part in a campaign of violence across Uganda is to appear at the international criminal court for one of the most important trials in its 14-year history.

Dominic Ongwen was among the most feared leaders of the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA), a cult blamed for the deaths of about 100,000 people and the abduction of 60,000 children.



He is accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity, including murder, pillage and enslavement, in northern Uganda and neighbouring countries.

The specific charges that will be read out on Tuesday focus on a series of attacks on refugee camps between 2004 and 2005, but Ongwen has also been blamed for scores of other atrocities.

One of the worst involved a four-day raid by the LRA on camps in north-eastern Congo in December 2009, in which about 350 civilians were killed and another 250, including at least 80 children, were abducted.

Ongwen faces life in prison if convicted. He has pleaded not guilty.

The trial has been hailed by human rights campaigners. Elise Keppler, an associate international justice director at Human Rights Watch, said it is a “significant first on justice for LRA atrocities”.

But determining the guilt or innocence of Ongwen is less straightforward than the reams of evidence gathered by the prosecution may suggest.

Ongwen was a child soldier and is believed to have been abducted by the LRA when he was nine years old. Therefore, according to his legal team and some observers, he is a perpetrator and a victim.

Ledio Cakaj, the author of When the Walking Defeats You, a book that documents the experiences of a bodyguard to the LRA leader, Joseph Kony, said: “A lot of these people of the LRA, who are considered as the bad guys, were in some sense victims in the first place. It’s a very tricky issue … There are very interesting questions here.”

Defence lawyers will argue that much of the evidence against Ongwen is unreliable and say their client was brutalised and traumatised after being abducted.

“He was tortured … forced to watch people being killed, used for fighting as a child soldier. Even the prosecution have said that what he went through is a serious mitigating factor,” said Thomas Obhof, a US lawyer based in Uganda and part of the defence team.

The prosecution is expected to emphasise that the former LRA commander’s competence, loyalty and aggression helped him quickly move up the ranks.

Some Ugandans have called for forgiveness. “I want Mr Ongwen to be forgiven as some of us [other] rebel abductees have been forgiven, because the Bible says we should forgive,” said Dominic Ecodu, who spent 10 years with the LRA after being abducted aged seven.

The savagery of Kony and his associates is not in doubt. The LRA waged war across five countries in east and central Africa for nearly 30 years and used mutilation as punishment, as well as kidnapping and raping young girls.

The group is now believed to comprise about 100 fighters, but it is still feared by civilians in remote communities and an inspiration to other militia groups, which have copied its brutal methods. Each week brings reports of new attacks.

Joseph Akweyu Manoba, a Ugandan lawyer appointed by the ICC to represent 1,500 of Ongwen’s alleged victims, said none of them believed that he was a victim. “They tell me that if the ICC doesn’t punish him and he returns to Uganda, then they will kill him themselves,” he said.

The Ongwen case is also significant for other reasons. Of the five senior LRA commanders indicted by the ICC 11 years ago, only Ongwen and Kony are still alive. Despite a $5m (£3.5m) reward for information leading to his capture, Kony remains at large.

Huge resources have been invested in building a case against the LRA leaders, whose arrest warrants were the first issued by the court.

The ICC, founded in 2002 to bring perpetrators of crimes that local criminal justice systems cannot deal with to justice, has been criticised widely in Africa by some who see it as a racist, imperialist institution. Nine out of the 10 cases being investigated by the ICC involve alleged crimes in Africa.

Defenders point out that the majority of the investigations have followed an explicit request or grant of jurisdiction from the government in the country where the crimes were allegedly committed, as in the case of Uganda. Others say the criticism of the institution only came when it started investigating acts allegedly committed by current rulers or their close associates from 2009.

Despite this, the ICC, which has an annual budget of more than €150m (£127m), has made progress in recent months.

In September, the court sentenced Ahmad al-Faqi al-Mahdi to nine years in prison after he pleaded guilty to destroying shrines that formed part of a Unesco world heritage site in Timbuktu, Mali, when the city was seized by Islamic militants in 2012.

South Africa, the Gambia and Burundi have announced their withdrawal from the court, but it is possible that none will leave.



The Gambia’s president-elect, Adama Barrow, who beat the authoritarian ruler Yahya Jammeh in an election last week, has said the country remains committed to the ICC.

On Monday, South Africa’s main opposition party launched a legal attempt to block government plans to withdraw from the ICC, claiming that the move is unconstitutional.

Ugandan citizens will be able to watch Ongwen’s trial in The Hague because the ICC has set up “viewing sites” where some of the alleged crimes were committed.

But Keppler added that many victims will not see justice, whatever the result. “Ongwen’s trial covers significant crimes, but does not extend to horrific LRA abuses committed outside Uganda,” she said. “This is a real loss for the LRA victims in [the Democratic Republic of the] Congo, Central African Republic and South Sudan.”

Regular beatings, sleep deprivation, stress positions and solitary confinement are among the tools used by China’s anti-corruption watchdog to force confessions, according to a report by Human Rights Watch.



The report throws the spotlight on to President Xi Jinping’s war on corruption, which has punished more than a million Communist party officials since 2013. Xi has said fighting corruption is “a matter of life and death” but many experts characterise the campaign as a political purge against members of rival factions.

The opaque extralegal detention system is used by anti-corruption officials to hold suspects indefinitely until they confess. At least 11 have died while in the custody of the country’s widely feared Commission for Discipline Inspection.

“President Xi has built his anti-corruption campaign on an abusive and illegal detention system,” said Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch.

“Torturing suspects to confess won’t bring an end to corruption but will end any confidence in China’s judicial system.”

All of China’s 88 million Communist party members can be subject to detention or shuanggui, which in Chinese means to report at a designated time and place, where suspects are held incommunicado and often in padded, windowless rooms.

“If you sit, you have to sit for 12 hours straight; if you stand, then you have to stand for 12 hours as well. My legs became swollen and my buttocks were raw and started oozing pus,” a former detainee is quoted as saying in the report. Names were withheld for fear of government reprisals.

Others have described detention simply as a “living hell”. It is extremely rare for those who have been through the system to speak openly.

In one account a detainee was kept awake for 23 hours a day, forced to stand the entire time and balance a book on his head, one lawyer said. After eight days he confessed “to whatever they said” and was then allowed to sleep for two hours a day.

While Xi champions his anti-corruption drive, he has also advocated enhancing China’s “rule of law”, but activists say the two concepts are completely at odds when suspects are tortured and forced to confess.

Although the anti-corruption campaign is technically separate from China’s judicial system, Human Rights Watch documented cases where prosecutors worked alongside corruption investigators, using the shuanggui system to gather evidence. After the extralegal detention, cases are usually transferred to the courts, where there is a 99.92% conviction rate.

“In shuanggui corruption cases the courts function as rubber stamps, lending credibility to an utterly illegal Communist party process,” Richardson said. “Shuanggui not only further undermines China’s judiciary – it makes a mockery of it.”

Those sentiments have been echoed by western governments as Xi has ramped up his anti-corruption push and use of the system has skyrocketed.

Shuanggui “operates without legal oversight” and suspects are “in some cases tortured”, the US State Department wrote in its annual human rights report on China. Some confessions extracted in detention were eventually overturned by courts, the US government report said.

Government officials are the majority of suspects disappeared into the system, but bankers, university administrators, entertainment industry figures and any other Communist party member can be detained.

Human Rights Watch called for shuanggui to be abolished, adding that successfully fighting corruption required “robust protections for the rights of suspects”.

“Eradicating corruption won’t be possible so long as the shuanggui system exists,” Richardson said. “Every day this system threatens the lives of party members and underscores the abuses inherent in President Xi’s anti-corruption campaign.”

Miss C. H. Pankhurst, daughter of the late Dr. Pankhurst, spoke last evening at a meeting of the Manchester Athenaeum Debating Society on “The admission of women to the legal profession.” It will be remembered that not long ago Miss Pankhurst was refused permission to qualify for admission to the Bar. In her address, which did not command unanimous assent, Miss Pankhurst said that she regarded the fight some of them were making to enter the legal profession as an attempt to remove one of the heaviest of the disabilities – and there were more than a few – to which the women of this time and this country were subject. She instanced as cases where obstacles had been raised one of a lady who had taken the London degree of LL.B. but was not allowed to qualify as a barrister, and another a lady in Scotland who, though not allowed to become a qualified law agent, was yet doing a lawyer’s work. She was the managing clerk of a busy lawyer, in fact his “right-hand man.”

In England, Miss Pankhurst said, women were not even allowed to submit themselves for the preliminary examination in order to become students of the Inns of Court. There was no law which excluded women from the solicitor branch of the profession, as she contended. She supposed, however, that if they went before the judges to decide upon the words of the Act they would find some way of deciding that the Act could not be construed to extend the right to women. 



“I suppose they think,” Miss Pankhurst added, “What is the good of being a lawyer if you cannot twist the law to your own ends?” At all events, she contended, there was no law against the admission of women to the legal profession, but there was the opposition of a very strong and determined trade union. – (Hear, hear.)

The reasons why she thought women ought to be admitted to the law were stated by Miss Pankhurst. First, this was a means of earning a living. The need of occupations for women seemed rather on the increase. She understood men did not want women to enter the profession, but unless they were lawyers they would see no reason why the law should have special protection against them. – (Hear, hear.)

Besides the stern necessity, there was among many women a desire for independence, and there should be free entrance into the profession. Every human being ought to have the right to the occupation best suited to his or her nature and talents. Further, in the legal as in the medical profession, she held that women ought to have the right to consult and take advice from women. In years to come it would be thought strange that the system which had obtained in our law courts should have been what it is.

The theory of the English Constitution was that people should be tried by their peers, but what did we find as to women? They were not relieved from any penalty for wrongdoing, from any burden the law threw on citizens in general; yet if they had to come before the courts they were not allowed to have their cases tried by a jury wholly or in part consisting of other women, nor was it ever possible that the judge upon the bench should be a woman, or that they should have women to represent them as counsel. It was extraordinary that this state of affairs had not worked more injustice than it had. At the same time, the ordinary citizen went little into the courts, and we could not lay it down that no injustice had happened. It was to be feared that it had.

It was a strange thing, she went on, that in England, a country which had taught other nations so much of liberty, should be so far behind in the admission of women to the profession of the law. In France, where women were in some respects behind those of England, they were admitted. So in Switzerland (in the cantons of Geneva and Zurich) and in Italy. In Rome a woman who was an LL.D. was a lecturer in law at the University. In the United States of America women had been long admitted. In nearly every State there were women lawyers, and not only were they ordinary lawyers, but sometimes got official positions. One lady (in Chicago) was said to make so large an income at the Bar as $10,000 a year. Miss Pankhurst thought that in this matter of income might lie a reason why English lawyers resented the idea of women lawyers. “Perhaps,” she said, “they do not want to share these $10,000 incomes with members of the other sex.” – (Laughter.) In Canada, in Victoria, in New Zealand there were women lawyers, so that England was not only behind other countries, but behind her own colonies and dependencies. – (Hear, hear.)

The attorney general for England and Wales, Jeremy Wright, makes his opening remarks to the Supreme Court on Monday
###########################################################
Theresa May’s plan to implement Brexit without the authorisation of a vote in parliament would be “a contemporary necessity” rather than a misuse of outdated ancient royal powers, the attorney general said at the start of the most keenly awaited constitutional law case in recent memory.



Opening the government’s submission in front of the 11 justices of the supreme court, Jeremy Wright QC and MP told the highest court in the land that royal prerogative powers were an essential part of the UK’s unwritten constitution and could therefore legitimately be used to trigger article 50.



Wright argued that the high court had been wrong to rule last month that article 50 could only be triggered after a vote in parliament, and said that the EU referendum had been conducted “with the universal expectation that the government would implement the result”.

The attorney general was speaking in front of a Westminster courtroom so crowded with lawyers, journalists and members of the public that some of the barristers and solicitors taking part had had to sit in neighbouring courts and watch the hearing by live video link.

Also present was Gina Miller, the fund manager who is the lead claimant in the case against the government. She was cheered loudly as she entered the supreme court and took a seat behind her legal team on the left-hand side of the court.

Protesters from both sides of the argument appeared outside the court; at 9am, the number of Europhile protesters outside the supreme court far outnumbered the Brexiters. An open top, double-decker bus carrying supporters dressed as judges, in wigs, capes and duelling swords parked outside. They chanted, “Nigel, where are you?”

Inside, Wright argued: “The foreign affairs prerogative is not an ancient relic, but a contemporary necessity. Including the powers to make and withdraw from treaties, it is a fundamental pillar of our constitution as a sovereign state and it is essential to the effective conduct of public business.

“The need [for governments] to maintain control of strategy and policy matters is clear and compelling.” Parliament is sovereign, Wright added, but it had chosen to limit the government’s prerogative powers “sparingly, conscious of the need for executive powers”.

At issue is whether the government, through its executive powers, or parliament, because it originally passed the 1972 European Communities Act, can trigger article 50 of the treaty on European Union, which formally begins the UK’s withdrawal from Brussels.

The politically sensitive case has provoked fierce attacks on the judiciary and claims from some newspapers that certain justices harbour private Europhile sympathies. In court, the arguments have exposed gaps in the UK’s unwritten constitution, as rival legal teams draw on different precedent cases and wrench an untested consensus apart.

Wright was followed by James Eadie, the seasoned presenter of government cases in the courts. Developing the government’s arguments following Wright’s opening submission, Eadie said that powers to make war and peace have long been part of the government’s executive powers.

But Eadie ran into a barrage of queries from the justices on the court, challenging the source of the royal prerogative and the limits of its use and peppered his presentation with questions, observations and interruptions.

Referring to the way in which the UK entered what was then the EEC, first Lord Wilson and then Lord Neuberger, president of the supreme court, pointed out that parliament and the government had worked together in 1972. “If entry was the result of a joint effort, should our departure [from the EU] also not be so?” Wilson inquired.

Neuberger remarked: “Parliament did its bit in passing the 1972 act. It was very much a joint affair. Whereas on [the government’s] argument, our withdrawal will not be a joint effort “

Lord Sumption, another of the justices, intervened to point out that where statutory instruments are normally replaced by parliamentary legislation, prerogative powers are removed only by implication.

Lord Reed asked whether what happened in 1972, when the European Communities Act came into force, should not dictate the means of withdrawal from the EU. Eadie disagreed. “What we are in the process of answering is a contemporary legal question,” the first Treasury counsel shot back.

Precedents summoned in support of the government’s prerogative powers included the De Keyser case, which related to compensation claimed for military occupation of a London hotel during the first world war. In that instance, the government relied on prerogative powers to limit compensation. Also invoked were the commercial failure of Freddie Laker’s Skytrain and a case involving the Fire Brigades Union.

Earlier, the attorney general had said that parliament had not voted to scrap the royal prerogative when it could have done so. The 2010 Constitutional and Reform of Government Act introduced a series of controls on ratification of treaties, “but it did not seek to control the prerogative powers [of the government] to make it withdraw from treaties”, Wright told the packed supreme court.

Parliament had been “fully and consciously” involved in drawing up the referendum legislation, the attorney general said. “Parliament expected the government to act on the answer the people gave.”

“If this is all about standing up for parliament,” Wright continued, “I say parliament can stand up for itself. When it comes to leaving the European Union, parliament has had full capacity and multiple opportunities to restrict the executive’s ordinary ability to begin the article 50 process, and it has not chosen to do so.”

As the case began, Theresa May’s official spokeswoman attacked both the Labour party and Liberal Democrats for failing to swing behind “the UK team” over the issue of Brexit. The comments from No 10 came after the spokeswoman was asked about the suggestion by Jeremy Corbyn and others that they would attempt to amend any bill on article 50 that the government introduced in the event of defeat in the supreme court.

“While others are seeming to make clear that they want to frustrate the will of the British people by slowing down the process of leaving and trying to tie the government’s hand in the negotiation, the government is getting on with respecting what the British people decided and making a success of Brexit,” she said. “If you are backing the UK team, you want them to be able to go into the negotiation and get the best deal possible.”

Before the legal arguments began, the president of the supreme court said none of the parties involved in the case had asked any of the 11 justices to stand down, or recuse themselves, from the hearing. Stressing the court’s determination to assert its impartiality in the proceedings, Lord Neuberger said: “At the direction of the court, the registrar has asked all the parties involved in these proceedings whether they wish to ask any of the justices to stand down,” Neuberger explained.

“Without exception, all parties to the appeal have stated that they have no objection to any of us sitting on this appeal.”

Every government needs a go-to troubleshooter. For more than a decade, anything that looks like a problem with a social policy dimension ends up with Dame Louise Casey. She is, as one headline writer recently had it, the tsar for all seasons – social exclusion, homelessness, troubled families and now community cohesion. But, however talented, no one person can be an expert in all these fields, and in a world where so much solid, careful research is undertaken in academic and policy wonk circles, she may be losing her shine. Not only has her troubled families programme, launched after the 2011 riots, been found to do quite a lot less than it promised; her review of community cohesion, written in little more than a year, has overlaid much sensible if largely familiar analysis of the migrant experience with a few confrontational suggestions and recommendations, like the arrivals lounge oath to “British values” that feels tailored to appeal to a particular demographic.

Before she was asked to do this latest review, Dame Louise was in Rotherham, looking at the underlying failings in the council and police behind an appalling episode of child sex abuse. Her latest review, published on Monday, revisits the kind of problems that she saw there, in particular the danger that a fear of appearing racist leads people who might intervene to look the other way even to condone what she calls “regressive ... cultural and religious practices”. Problems related to the activities of sharia councils and Muslim arbitration tribunals (MATs) are given a high profile. She is right that there are important points to make about the way some women experience discrimination, in particular in relation to divorce. She makes some sensible recommendations. Yet it feels as if she makes them with half an eye on Rotherham, and it undermines her argument. Child sex abuse happens in many places: ask a footballer.

Social cohesion is not a one-way street. Nor are sharia councils or MATs part of the experience of most Britons. The bigger point about community cohesion and immigration is how rapidly some areas have changed, and how inadequate public service provision – or even detailed knowledge of the need for provision – has been. Dame Louise is clearly alert to the dangers of making minority groups feel as if they are a problem, yet she falls into the very trap she so carefully describes. The word Muslim appears on almost every one of the 300-plus-page report, and Islam gets 100 mentions too. The review was launched by David Cameron in the course of a speech on extremism, and, if rarely spoken, the idea is never far away. So while it is reported that more than half of the general public think that there is a fundamental clash between Islam and British values, the findings of a survey by the University of Essex in 2013, which found that 83% of Muslims were proud to be British, compared with 79% of the general public, are not mentioned. In the end, the focus on Muslims, with scant recognition of the variety of Islamic faiths, undermines the strengths of Dame Louise’s findings.

Poverty, bad housing, access to education and skills – regardless of ethnicity these are well-recognised obstacles to success; in some towns ethnically Asian children underperform at school, but white working-class boys everywhere do worse. A command of English is vital, but there are many reasons why women may not have it. Opposition at home is one, but it might be badly timed classes, or, more likely still, their cost. When David Cameron announced that non-English speakers risked deportation, he had just cut £45m from the English language teaching budget. Councils say their biggest challenge is not understanding what needs to be done, but finding the cash to do it. As a forthcoming report about life in Bedford from the IPPR thinktank observes, what’s needed is not compulsion but the small, sensitive improvements in services that build confidence across the whole community.

A graduate has won a round in his £1m legal battle over his failure to get a first from Oxford University.

Faiz Siddiqui alleges the “appallingly bad” teaching he received on the Indian special subject part of his modern history course resulted in him only getting an upper second degree when he took his finals in June 2000.

Oxford University, which claims the case has no merit and was brought outside the legal time limit, had asked Mr Justice Kerr to strike it out at an early stage. But on Monday the high court judge allowed the action to proceed to be fully argued.

He said it was agreed resources were stretched to teach the course, and part of Siddiqui’s claim had a prospect of success.

Siddiqui, 38, claims a number of members of staff were absent on sabbatical leave at the same time and that there was a failure to remedy the issue. He has also alleged the university mishandled medical information about him being submitted to the examiners, although Oxford claimed this was taken into account.

He claims he would have had a career as an international commercial lawyer if he had gained the top qualification at the end of his time at Brasenose College. He alleges his anxiety, depression and insomnia have been significantly exacerbated by the wrongs he claims to have suffered.

Siddiqui did not have an overwhelmingly strong case in relation to his medical issues, but this too passed the legal test of whether it had a real chance of success, the judge said.

While the university was right about the number of years that had passed, so that memories had dimmed and exam scripts were unavailable, Kerr said Siddiqui had a real chance of persuading a judge the case was not time-barred or that it would be just for it to proceed in any event.

Directing that the claim should be tried as soon as possible, he said: “For those reasons I am satisfied the university has a case to answer.”

The UK higher education sector has a global reputation for excellence, offering high-quality learning opportunities for more than 2.5 million students across a diverse range of universities and colleges, large and small.

As the representative bodies for UK higher education, Universities UK and GuildHE recognise that new primary legislation, in the form of a higher education and research bill, is essential. The regulatory framework has not kept up with the implications of fee changes, increased competition and the growth in new alternative providers. That is why we support the objectives of the bill to provide greater protection for students and ensure that all providers of higher education – old or new – can be regulated fairly, consistently and on the basis of risk.

However, in the form that gets its second reading in the House of Lords on 6 December, the bill retains flaws. Proposals that would allow untested organisations to award degrees much more quickly and without robust, independent scrutiny of their suitability. Our members are concerned about the potential for the secretary of state to intervene in areas such as academic standards and course funding, and they reject proposals that a government body, rather than an existing higher education provider, should be able to underwrite degrees awarded by a new provider.

The government was right to introduce the bill. But we need the House of Lords to amend and improve the bill over the coming months to transform it into the legislation our world-class higher education sector needs.

A lone man, disguised as an elf – though he could have been a lone elf, disguised as a man – carried a placard that read: “Nigel Farage was sent by Christ to get Britain out of Europe and Fulfill [sic] Bible Prophecy”. He didn’t quote chapter and verse. Of Nigel himself, there was no sight. Christ had come to him in a vision and warned him that leading a People’s Army to the supreme court to protest against a vote that hadn’t gone his way in the divisional courts might not be the best of looks for the self-proclaimed saviour of democracy. The only activists out on the street were a busload of Europhiles who appeared mildly disappointed there were no Brexiteers to taunt.

Inside court one, cohorts of lawyers searched vainly for a seat. The government’s appeal against the ruling that insisted article 50 could not be invoked without an act of parliament has been good business for the legal profession. Dozens of juniors were sidelined into an overspill room to make sure there was enough seats for a few members of the public and a handful of journalists. There was a brief frisson when Gina Miller, the woman who had originally taken the government to court, entered the room, but the day wasn’t really about her. The opening day was for the government to put its best foot forward and convince the court that it could do without parliament’s help in leaving the EU.

On the stroke of 11am, the 11 supreme court justices entered the wood-panelled court room and took their seats. Neither they, nor other members of the judiciary, have taken kindly to being branded the undemocratically elected “Enemies of the People” by the Daily Mail – pots and kettles come to mind – and Lord Neuberger opened with a warning about the level of threats that had been made against both them and some of the original claimants.

Jeremy Wright, the attorney general, who was the lead-off man for the government, ought to have been embarrassed by the necessity for Neuberger to make such introductory remarks, but didn’t appear to bat an eyelid. Either because the government is quite happy for the Daily Mail to rubbish the judges on its behalf, or because he didn’t quite understand their significance. Most likely the latter. 



Wright may have his talents, but being a lawyer does not count as one of them. The job of attorney general usually goes to one of the top legal minds in the country, not to someone who was described by a former MP as “a third-rate conveyancing lawyer”. But the government doesn’t have anyone better qualified, and so a man more used to pleading cases of failed dampproofing courses was charged with being its warm-up act.

“Very sensible,” replied Neuberger, anxious to avoid the attorney general getting even further out of his depth.

Wright sensibly cut to the chase. He stuck to reading his script – only stumbling once or twice over some of the longer words – and sat down again within 20 minutes, having basically told the court that he wasn’t really qualified to be there, he didn’t understand any of the issues, and was going to let James Eadie, aka the Treasury Devil, do all the heavy lifting. He’d only been there for ornamental purposes.

“I don’t propose to go on and on,” Eadie began, before going on to do just that. The courtroom began to feel stifling and one or two people began to get very heavy-lidded. Sensing he was losing his audience before he had started, Eadie made a bad gag, at which a few of his team laughed sycophantically. Lady Hale was unmoved, observing that some of his bundles were not in the right order.

That intervention was the cue for the judges to mount polite guerrilla warfare on Eadie for the rest of the day. They knew he was too bright to be this vague, so the only possible reason he could have for deliberately missing the point was to steer them away from the fact that he wasn’t entirely sure what point it was he was trying to make. This kind of thing doesn’t normally bother lawyers of Eadie’s calibre, but it’s not every day you’re up against the 11 best legal minds in the country.

Eadie blustered on with talk of ambulatory conduits on the international plane and double-negative resolution procedures, but the justices were not to be swayed. Time and again they picked him up on the detail.

“This isn’t reflected in the papers,” said Lord Mance.

“This is another possible instance of you stating something in the wrong place,” observed Lord Wilson.

“Why are you spending so long on 1972?” inquired Lord Carnworth.

“Is this realistic?” interrupted Lord Mance, who was turning into Eadie’s bete noire. “There’s a huge difference between changes to the rules of a club and deciding not to be a member of that club.”

Eadie puffed out his cheeks. It had been a long day. And Tuesday might be even longer.

Like Kevin Spacey’s character in The Usual Suspects, a mystery name echoed around the supreme court on Monday during otherwise dry legal argument over the government’s right to leave the European Union. Instead of “Who is Keyser Söze?”, the question on the lips of the 11 justices and dozens of lawyers was: “What does Keyser tell us?”

The Keyser in this instance is De Keyser, a luxury hotel on the Thames that was requisitioned during the first world war to house officers in some opulence but then became a byword for government overreach when the owners successfully sued for compensation.

The landmark 1920 legal judgment was one of a number of historical cases bandied back and forth in the supreme court as it attempted to judge whether parliament should be consulted before the government begins the far more vexed process of leaving the EU.

Other surprise cameos in this dramatic twist of the Brexit tale were played by the 1970s airline entrepreneur Sir Freddie Laker, the Stuart monarch King James I, and another test case involving the Fire Brigades Union.

But it was the De Keyser role that presented the most obvious challenge for government lawyer James Eadie QC. In theory, it establishes a precedent that where parliament has intervened already – originally by setting out terms for wartime compensation, and now through the 1972 European Communities Act – the government cannot simply turn to the prerogative of Stuart kings for its independent authority.

Eadie decided to tackle this head on, repeatedly invoking the name of the long-forgotten luxury hotel as he argued that the government maintains its historic prerogative to conduct foreign treaties despite the shared role of parliament in taking Britain into the EU.

“You know, I hope, and think, and if not, someone had better shout, but you know the background and the nature of the facts,” he told the justices. “The army council requisitioned a hotel for the use of the Royal Flying Corps and it denied the hotel owners a right to compensation.” Just to make sure, he made them read key passages of the landmark judgment in an effort to show that things were different in the case at hand.

Ironically, De Keyser was founded by a Belgian immigrant on a site a mile or so down river from the courtroom, on land now occupied by Anglo-Dutch multinational Unilever.

Another challenge to the government’s authority also kept popping up in the guise of Laker Airways Ltd v Department of Trade, which found that the government had similarly overstepped its power to ignore legislation by preventing the launch of Skytrain, a low-cost competitor to British Airways.

In the end, argued Eadie, the right of ministers to invoke article 50 and thus alone begin the process of leaving the EU relies on power far older than 1970s budget airlines or first world war-era hotels. The power inherited from kings and first tested in the 1611 Case of Proclamations is no “ancient relic”, claims the government, but a “‘fundamental pillar of our constitutional state”.

The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) is facing calls to scrap and rewrite the policy on restraining minors after it emerged that a report it commissioned found some authorised techniques could kill children or leave them disabled.

An internal risk assessment of restraint techniques, obtained by the Guardian, shows that certain procedures approved for use against non-compliant children carry a 40% or 60% chance of causing injuries involving the child’s airway, breathing or circulation, the consequences of which could be “catastrophic”.

The undated report defines catastrophic injury as “death or permanent severe disability affecting everyday life” and ranks the chances of it occurring in each approved restraint technique out of five. It found that 28 of the 66 scenarios assessed had at least a 40% chance of causing that level of harm.

The medical review of restraints applied to children in young offender institutions (YOIs) and secure training centres (STCs) was completed for the government by an independent medical adviser and made public for the first time after a freedom of information (FoI) request.

Carolyne Willow, the director of children’s rights charity Article 39, who obtained the documents, said: “What kind of society trains adults to use restraint techniques that could cause children to die or be severely disabled? 



“Techniques assessed as potentially causing catastrophic harm to children, with a likelihood of more than never, should be immediately struck out of the manual.

“Children have reported feeling terror, panic, desperation, shame, humiliation and anger during restraint. These testimonies from children, together with the appalling restraint-related deaths … should remain uppermost in our minds. We need a completely fresh start with policy and practice led by experts in looking after children.”

Willow has been engaged in a long-running legal battle for greater transparency in the government’s approach to youth restraints. The risk assessment forms part of a broader manual on restraint techniques, known as the MMPR (pdf), which has only been released to the public in redacted form, but the full version of which is the subject of an FoI appeal launched by Willow that could be taken to the court of appeal.

The MoJ refused to make the syllabus publicly available on the grounds that some of the techniques in the manual are similar to those used in adult prisons, and its release could undermine the safety of prisoners and guards across the justice system.

However, it released the risk assessment table for children being restrained using MMPR in detention or being taken to detention, which also includes children being deported. An MoJ spokesman said restraints were intended to be used as a last resort to prevent detainees harming themselves or others, to prevent damage to property and to prevent escape, but critics have warned that the guidelines are open to misuse.

He added: “Every incident of restraint is reviewed by the establishment. This includes looking at whether any lessons can be learned for the future. We have introduced a new system designed to minimise the use of physical restraint in youth custody and we are committed to improving practice further.”

YOIs take young people up to the age of 20. In March this year, there were 882 children (under-18s) in custody in England and Wales, and 4,668 18- to 20-year-olds. The three STCs in England and Wales have a combined capacity of about 270.

In 2015, there were 28 incidents of restraint per 100 children, which was up from 10 per 100 children in 2010. There were 429 injuries to children reported as a result of restraint in 2015.



Among the techniques identified as dangerous in the risk assessment is moving a child through a doorway while wearing a waist restraint belt, for which there is a three out of five chance of suffering breathing difficulties resulting in catastrophic harm.

The independent medical adviser also found that head holds, the mandibular angle technique (which involves applying upward pressure below the jaw, near the ear), moving a child under restraint, a figure of four leg hold in prone position, and strip-searching a child in prone position or on their side all had a two in five likelihood of resulting in grave harm.

Moving a non-compliant child off transport, restraining a child on the ground, a figure of four arm hold to an inverted wrist, thumb flexion, moving a child under restraint “whilst negotiating stairs”, rigid bar handcuffs, straight arm hold to an inverted wrist also all had a three out of five chance of resulting in fracture or dislocation and ligament or tendon damage.

The assessment acknowledges that such injuries require hospital attendance or admission but rates them only as “minor” or “moderate”.

The Youth Justice Board (YJB) says officers receive “detailed medical advice on the physiological aspects of the youngest age range to make sure that the use of force is minimised, used only when necessary, and, when it is used, that the risk of injury to young people is minimised”.

Staff are trained in the use of MMPR by experts, and understanding is assessed through a written test and scenario-based exercise. The manual states that they “must be able to demonstrate the required level of understanding before being authorised to use MMPR in an operational environment”. Staff receive a minimum of one day’s refresher training every six months.

Willow has fought for children’s rights in custody since the death of 15-year-old Gareth Myatt in 2004. He was being restrained after refusing to clean a sandwich toaster at Rainsbrook secure training centre. Myatt, who weighed 40kg (six and a half stone) and stood 1.47m (4ft 10in) tall, was forced into a sitting position by three G4S officers, his upper body bent towards his thighs and knees. The officers ignored Myatt’s cries that he could not breathe and was going to defecate, which he did before vomiting. One restraining officer was 1.85m tall (6ft 1in) and 90kg (14st). When Myatt told the officers he could not breathe, one replied: “Well, if you are shouting, you can breathe.”

His death was later found at an inquest to be accidental. The restraint technique used, known as the seated double embrace, was withdrawn two months after he died.

MMPR, which was introduced following a lengthy review in 2012, was intended as a safer and more humane way of restraining children, emphasising the importance of staff using their existing relationships with children to de-escalate volatile incidents, and minimising the number of children who experience restraint. The risk assessment is believed to have been commissioned by then. But in the 2015 report by HM Inspectorate of Prisons, former chief inspector Nick Hardwick wrote: “Children frequently reported to us that they struggled to breathe during a restraint.”

In granting the FoI request for the risk assessment, the MoJ stressed: “If a technique scores highly in the consequences section, it does not mean that this injury will occur, as it is scored with the worst possible outcome in mind.”

It added: “To date there have been no recorded serious injuries or warning signs recorded from the escort services.”

Dave Hill, president of the Association of Directors of Children’s Services, said: “Department for Education guidance is absolutely clear in that restraint should only be used where absolutely necessary and should be reasonable and proportionate to the circumstances. Restraint that deliberately inflicts pain should never be used on children.”

A spokeswoman for the YJB said: “The safety and welfare of the young people in the youth justice system is of paramount importance to the YJB. MMPR was devised by a team of experts who extensively researched and carefully considered the best ways to keep children in custody, and the staff looking after them, safe. Restraint should only ever be used as a last resort with staff using their relationships with the children in their care to manage their behaviour. Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Prisons’ thematic on MMPR published last year concluded that MMPR was a good system but it needed more time to be embedded.”

Nearly half of Americans believe it acceptable to torture enemy combatants, according to a new survey which suggests that 15 years of warfare have significantly recast American attitudes on torture.

The poll, conducted by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), found that 46% of Americans believe it acceptable to torture enemy combatants, with just 30% opposed to the practice and another 24% unsure or unwilling to answer.

Only Nigeria and Israel record higher rates of support for torturing captured enemy fighters, with 70% and 50% endorsements, respectively.



By contrast, in 1999 – the last time the ICRC conducted its “People on War” poll – 65% of Americans said the US could not torture captured enemy fighters, and 57% favored permitting an independent monitor to observe detention conditions.

The survey found a coarsening of attitudes towards obligations to civilians in wartime among people in the US, UK, Russia, China and France – the permanent members of the United Nations security council, which possess disproportionate power to set the global governance agenda.

As Donald Trump, who has endorsed torture enthusiastically, prepares to take the White House, some 33% of Americans consider torture “a part of war”, with another 13% unsure or unwilling to answer.

The poll found that 54% of Americans consider torture “wrong”, a lower proportion than in any other population save for those of Israel and Palestine. Only 44% of Israelis and only 35% of Palestinians considered torture to be wrong.

The poll comes as rising tides of illiberalism have washed over the world’s great powers. In addition to Trump’s election, the UK has voted to leave the European Union and in France, the leader of the far-right Front National has led in a number of polls ahead of next year’s presidential elections. Russia and China have become more expansionist than they have been in decades, with Russia destabilizing Ukraine and China pressing maximalist territorial claims in the South China Sea.

Absolute opposition to torture was recorded by 100% of Yemeni respondents, 73% of Syrians, 68% of Iraqis, 80% of Ukrainians, and 58% of South Sudanese.

Across the so-called Permanent Five countries on the security council, 46% of respondents advocated additional assistance to migrants and refugees fleeing conflicts, an urgent question seized upon by rightwing politicians in Europe and the US in response to an influx of Middle Eastern refugees. But 79% of respondents from conflict-wracked nations urged greater help.

“There is a higher degree of acceptance amongst people living in the [Permanent Five Security Council] countries and Switzerland that the death of civilians in conflict zones is an inevitable part of war,” found the ICRC, which polled 17,000 people in 16 countries.

Across those countries, 48% of people believe that a captured enemy combatant cannot “be tortured to obtain important military information”, a figure sharply lower than the 66% opposition recorded in 1999.

Areas in active conflict record greater urgency over questions of civilian protection in wartime than do the great powers that often conduct or participate in those conflicts. In Ukraine, 83% believe everyone wounded and sick during a conflict has a right to health care, compared with 62% of Russians. A full 100% of Yemenis endorse the proposition, as do 81% of Afghans, 66% of Syrians and 42% of Iraqis – compared with 49% of Americans, 53% of Britons, 37% of the Chinese and 67% of the French.

Only 59% oppose attacking a target with the knowledge that civilians will be killed, down from 68% in 1999, the ICRC found. While the 2016 study did not break the finding down by country, in 1999, its predecessor poll found that 52% of Americans believed the US ought only attack enemy combatants, while 42% believed the US should leave civilians alone “as much as possible”.

Turning to the 2015 legislation that authorised the EU referendum, Eadie acknowledged it did not explicitly explain how the result should be put into effect.

But, he said, that did not mean that the act was, as the high court ruled, “legally irrelevant”. It implied that the royal prerogative should be used to implement withdrawal, Eadie said.

“Was parliament in 2015 really in setting up the referendum doing nothing more than simply reserving to itself the right to leave the EU?” he asked. “Not merely is it highly improbable, but that would run counter to the repeated statements of ministers and the government.”

The use of the government’s royal prerogative for executive actions, such as triggering Brexit, is not an ancient relic of outdated laws but a crucial part of the modern state’s powers, the attorney general has told the supreme court.

Opening the argument on behalf of the Department for Exiting the European Union in the pivotal constitutional case, Jeremy Wright QC said the EU referendum had been conducted “with the universal expectation that the government would implement the result”.

The high court – which last month declared that only parliament had the authority to initiate Brexit – had been wrong to dismiss the way the referendum was organised as “legally irrelevant”, the attorney general said. The result of the 23 June vote was 52% to 48% in favour of leaving the EU.



“The use of prerogative in foreign affairs is not an ancient relic but a … fundamental pillar of our constitutional state,” Wright said. “The need [for governments] to maintain control of strategy and policy matters is clear and compelling.” Parliament is sovereign, Wright added, but it had chosen to limit the government’s prerogative powers “sparingly, conscious of the need for executive powers”.

At issue is whether the government, through its executive powers, or parliament, because it originally passed the European Communities Act 1972, can trigger article 50 of the treaty on European Union, which formally begins the UK’s departure from the EU.

The four-day hearing in front of 11 justices of the UK’s highest court has provoked fierce attacks on the judges who have to decide the politically sensitive dispute. The courtroom argument is straining the UK’s unwritten constitution, as rival lawyers stress different interpretations of legal precedents.

Most of the morning’s legal exchanges revolved around the nature of the royal prerogative, the executive powers inherited by the government from the crown, and how parliament had legislated to restrict such executive freedom in the past.

The Constitutional and Reform of Government Act 2010 introduced a series of controls on ratification of treaties “but it did not seek to control the prerogative powers [of the government] to make it withdraw from treaties”, Wright told the packed supreme court.

Parliament had been “fully and consciously” involved in drawing up the referendum legislation, the attorney general said. “Parliament expected the government to act on the answer the people gave.

“In this case, the imposition of a legislative pre-condition by the courts which parliament did not choose to impose cannot be supportive of parliamentary sovereignty,” Wright said.

James Eadie QC, who developed the government’s arguments after Wright’s opening submission, said powers to make war and peace had long been part of the government’s executive powers. “Governments can take steps without further parliamentary legislation including by removing [individuals’] rights,” he said.

The rights of UK citizens are frequently affected not only by the government’s international dealings but by other sovereign states making decisions. Greenland’s departure from the EU took away rights of UK citizens in relation to that country, Eadie pointed out.

He added: “The starting point is the expectation from parliament and the courts to require clarity before prerogative powers are removed … It’s no small thing to alter the constitutional balance by limiting longstanding powers.”

But the supreme court justice Lord Sumption intervened to point out that where statutory instruments are normally replaced by parliamentary legislation, prerogative powers are often removed only by implication.

Eadie said parliament had already intervened in the areas of treaties and decided – in the 2010 Constitutional Reform and Governance Act – what prerogatives should exist.

But referring to the way in which the UK entered what was then the European Economic Community, both Lord Neuberger and Lord Wilson pointed out that parliament and the government had worked together in 1972.

“If entry was the result of a joint effort, should our departure [from the EU] also not be so,” Wilson inquired.

Neuberger said: “Parliament did its bit in passing the 1972 act. It was very much a joint affair. Whereas on [the government’s] argument, our withdrawal will not be a joint effort.”

The European Union (Amendment) Act 2008 was a review of parliamentary powers over relations with the EU, Eadie said. It even mentioned article 50 in its introductory notes but, Eadie continued, “parliament’s intention was to leave article 50 well alone. Parliament chose not to extend its explicit powers to include withdrawal from the EU.”

Turning to the 2015 legislation that authorised the EU referendum, Eadie acknowledged it did not explicitly explain how the result should be put into effect.

But that did not mean the act was, as the high court ruled, “legally irrelevant”, he said. It implied that the royal prerogative should be used to implement withdrawal.

“Was parliament in 2015 really in setting up the referendum doing nothing more than simply reserving to itself the right to leave the EU?” he asked. “Not merely is it highly improbable, but that would run counter to the repeated statements of ministers and the government.”

In his opening remarks, the president of the supreme court said none of the parties involved in the case had asked any of the 11 justices to stand down before the hearing.

Neuberger’s comments, made after fiercely critical coverage from pro-Brexit newspapers, reflects the court’s determination to assert its impartiality in the proceedings.

“It is right to record that, at the direction of the court, the registrar has asked all the parties involved in these proceedings whether they wish to ask any of the justices to stand down,” he explained. “Without exception, all parties to the appeal have stated that they have no objection to any of us sitting on this appeal.”

He also reminded the media that the names of some of the former claimants and their families should not be identified because of online abuse.

“We have made this order largely because various individuals have received threats of serious violence and unpleasant abuse in emails and other electronic communications,” Neuberger said.

“Threatening and abusing people because they are exercising their fundamental right to go to court undermines the rule of law. Anyone who communicates such threats or abuse should be aware that there are legal powers designed to ensure that access to the courts is available to everyone.”

There are so many lawyers, journalists and members of the public in court that some of the barristers and solicitors taking part have had to sit in neighbouring courts, watching the hearing by live video link.

A handful of demonstrators gathered outside the court, some carrying union flags, as the dense legal argument probing the significance of past cases continued. Scores of police officers were on patrol outside the court in Parliament Square. There was no sign of any trouble.

Attacks on the upper middle class composition and presumed (right wing) political leanings of the judiciary used to be the preserve of the left.

Now the attacks on the mono-social class of senior judges and their presumed (pro-European Union) political leanings are being waged from the right.

The Daily Mail, in particular, has worked itself up into a fury about the matter, which means, of course, that its editor-in-chief, Paul Dacre, has done so.

One of his key complaints is that judges are unelected, as is the other major group of Brexit oppositionists, members of the House of Lords.

I don’t recall Dacre - or his employer, Viscount Rothermere - standing for election. They rely instead on pointing to the fact that their large newspaper audience gives them a mandate, and that they speak for them.

In fact, according to the latest National Readership Survey, the Mail is read by about 3.35m adults every day. Given that the current UK population is 64m, the Mail’s reach is barely 5%.

But the paper’s influence is far greater than those figures suggest. Why? Partly, because its audience contains a sizeable chunk of society’s major opinion-formers. And partly, maybe mainly, because we, the competing media, help to publicise it.

Media is obsessed with media. And, before you click to make the obvious point, I am, by the nature of my media commentating role, one of the guilty parties.

We police each other and, in so doing, we promote each other. Broadcasters, whether on TV or radio, live off newspaper content. Social media is the most promiscuous of press parasites.

It means that the Mail carries weight out of all proportion to its audience (and don’t be fooled by the Mail Online numbers: people don’t read that website for the paper’s political output).

The point is that the Mail’s views are known far beyond its regular readership. It is also influential because, like it or not, and Guardian readers generally do not, the Mail is good at what it does. Good, you might say, at being bad.

It long ago eclipsed the Sun as the major Fleet Streeet agenda-setter. It is the outstanding paper of this generation and other right-of-centre papers - the Sun, Daily Telegraph and Daily Express - acknowledge that fact by singing from its hymn book.

Whether consciously or unconsciously, they pick up on its general approach to the politics of the day, echoing its opinions and offering tacit support to its campaigns of vilification.



I am sure a larger number of Sun readers voted for Brexit than Mail readers. Sun editor Tony Gallagher has no time for the European Union and his paper campaigned unrelentingly for leave during the EU referendum campaign

But the whole tone of the media’s anti-Brexit crusade was forged in the Kensington headquarters of the Mail. And its chief architect was therefore Dacre.

Now, as fears of a possible Brexit breakdown loom, he is leading the assault on the judiciary. In Monday’s Mail, he ran a spread decrying the “secret” way in which the 11 judges are selected for Britain’s supreme court, comparing it unfavourably with the public selection of their US equivalents.

He also carried a leading article, in which it was argued that it is “utterly impossible” for the judges “to deliberate in a vacuum.”

Many people, and including many on the left, would have some sympathy for the view that the judicial selection process is too secretive.

I’m not sure, however, if we would benefit from adopting the US system of public grillings in the senate, which the Mail concedes to be a sometimes “ugly spectacle.”

Greater transparency about how the supreme court members are chosen would not be unwelcome, but do we want to select them on the basis of their political views?

That would surely lead to what happens in the States: the loading of the court to suit the politicians of the day, most notably the sitting president.

I suspect that that is exactly what the Mail wants, as its editorial polemic implies. Ever since the high court ruled that parliament had the right (and duty) to vote on Britain leaving the EU, the paper has ignored the reality of that decision having been made on a legal, not a political, basis.

So it now believes the supreme court will follow suit, contending that the 11 judges cannot possibly “be guided only by intellectual legalistic principles, divorcing themselves from the consequences of their decision.”

Then comes a wonderful example of tortured Mail logic. The judges cannot, says the paper, be “impervious to the political heat and fury surrounding their ruling.”

Which begs the question: who is responsible for generating most of “the political heat and fury”? And will the judges remain impervious to that?
###########################################################
All 11 of the UK’s most senior judges will take their seats on the supreme court bench on Monday to decide whether parliament or the government has the authority to trigger Brexit.



The four-day hearing on the divisive constitutional issue will be broadcast live, testing the public’s appetite for intricate legal argument, arcane vocabulary and historical precedents.

The “justices”, as supreme court judges are known, may still be pondering their conclusions as they digest their Christmas puddings; their eagerly awaited judgment is not expected to be delivered until January. 



Emotions are running high. Ukip has accused those behind the claim of being “arrogant federalists” intent on blocking Brexit, the Daily Mail has branded the high court judges who found against the government in the first round as “enemies of the people” and individual challengers – such as Gina Miller – have received death threats.



Nigel Farage’s pledge to lead a protest march of 100,000 Brexiters to the doors of the court may have receded, but the high-ceilinged courtroom will be packed with senior law officers and QCs from Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales as well as the rival claimants’ legal teams and interveners.



On Monday, Labour’s shadow attorney general, Shami Chakrabarti, said the political aspect of the case had been “hyped in parts of the media”. She said: “This is about process. It is not about outcomes.”



Chakrabarti told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “It’s not just about doing it or not doing it. There are lots of questions to be decided about what happens next – how we live after Brexit, what our relationship will be with the remaining states of the European Union.”

She said it was unfair for newspapers to delve into the personal lives or supposed opinions of the judges.

“They have to be referees of the constitution,” she said. “If we start dragging these people through the media or through politics, putting them through a kind of political scrutiny – people like me are fair game, but the judges are not fair game. They cannot speak up for themselves. We all need them in the end if we’re going to settle our disputes in a civilised way in a courtroom.”

The panel of 11 justices is the largest ever assembled for a single case since the law lords were created in 1876. Such judicial mass mobilisation is recognition of the constitutional significance and political sensitivity of the hearing. 



The bench will be led by the president of the supreme court, Lord Neuberger, and his deputy, Lady Hale. There are 12 justices on the court but one has recently retired and is yet to be replaced. The court normally sits in panels of five; an odd number is always required to ensure there cannot be a tie. 



The court is housed in the neo-Tudor exuberance of what was once Middlesex County Hall, Westminster, opposite parliament. Its proceedings are less archaic than most crown courts: wigs are no longer worn and hearings are routinely broadcast live online. Most documents will be in digital versions. Daily transcripts of the hearing will be published.

The legal dispute is over who has authority to notify Brussels formally that Britain is withdrawing under article 50 of the treaty on European Union (TEU) – parliament or ministers.



Article 50 states that any member state may leave “in accordance with its own constitutional requirements”, an undefined term that has allowed both sides to pursue rival interpretations. The case has opened deep rifts in the consensus over the UK’s unwritten constitution.



Having lost by a three-nil ruling at the high court, there was speculation that the government would switch its argument on appeal and tell the court that article 50, which triggers Brexit, can be reversed at a future date by parliament. That would enable ministers to say that once triggered, MPs would have a subsequent opportunity to control the process.

Acknowledging that Brexit is not irrevocable would, however, be politically awkward for the prime minister and could risk the case being referred to the European court of justice (ECJ) in Luxembourg, the EU’s highest court, for clarification of the treaty’s meaning.



Such a diversion – apart from handing European judges power over the most intimate working of the UK’s constitution – would delay Brexit for months. None of the main parties is eager for a referral to Luxembourg.



The justices are unlikely to want it either but may not be able to ignore the question entirely. Some of the appellants from Northern Ireland argue in their submission that “if the court feels that anything turns on this issue ... plainly it is an issue of EU law which should be referred to the court of justice of the European Union”.

Legal submissions are due to be opened by the attorney general for England and Wales, Jeremy Wright QC, who will outline the government’s argument that executive powers, inherited through what was once the royal prerogative, are sufficient to sign and authorise international treaties. 



The industrious James Eadie QC, whose work as “Treasury devil” requires him to be present at innumerable cases involving the government, will pick up the more detailed line of reasoning along with Jason Coppel QC. The Brexit secretary, David Davis MP, formally the respondent in the case, is not expected to be present in court.

As well as Wright, who is a Conservative MP, other senior law officers taking part include the counsel general for Wales, Mick Antoniw, who is a Labour member of the Welsh assembly, Scotland’s lord advocate, James Wolffe QC, and the attorney general for Northern Ireland, John Larkin QC.



The original challengers have retained a host of successful QCs to develop their assertion that the government cannot arbitrarily remove rights established through domestic legislation by executive decree. Parliamentary sovereignty, they maintain, is supreme.

• Gina Miller, a UK investment manager. She is represented by the law firm Mishcon de Reya, Lord Pannick QC and Rhodri Thompson QC.

The 51-year-old lead claimant was born in Guyana but became a UK citizen. Miller has received death threats. She denies that her challenge is aimed at reversing Brexit. 



She has commented: “All the people who have been saying ‘we need to take back control’, ‘we need sovereignty’, well you can’t have it with one hand and then with the other say, ‘I’m going to bypass it now and not seek consultation from the representatives in parliament’. You just can’t have it both ways.”

• Deir Tozetti Dos Santos, a hairdresser who holds UK and European citizenship, is represented by the law firm Edwin Coe, Dominic Chambers QC and Jessica Simor QC.



Dos Santos, 37, works at a salon in Belgravia, central London. He has kept a lower profile than Miller and has been targeted with online abuse. After winning the high court case, he told The Guardian: “I have never challenged the result of the referendum – in fact I voted for Brexit in the referendum for the sole reason that I wanted power to be returned from Europe to the British parliament.



“But I did not think it was right for government then just to bypass parliament and try to take away my legal rights without consulting parliament first ... In her speech to the Conservative party conference, the prime minister attacked me for bringing these proceedings as a claimant. She said I was trying to subvert democracy. That was an unwarranted and irresponsible attack.”

• The People’s Challenge, a crowdfunded initiative, represented by the law firm Bindmans, Helen Mountfield QC and Gerry Facenna QC. It is the first fully-funded claim on CrowdJustice to reach the supreme court. One of the leading activists is Grahame Pigney, who lives in France. “The rights and privileges of Britons [who live in Europe] didn’t figure in the Brexit debate. The referendum was advisory. It must go back to parliament ... as parliament has granted us these rights, it is for parliament to decide when, how and under what circumstances they are taken away.”

• AB and a child, represented by the law firm Bhatia Best and Manjit Gill QC. Brought on behalf of children whose right to residence in UK depends on their EU treaty rights.

• Fair Deal for Expats, a group formed by British expatriates living abroad in 10 EU states, represented by the law firm Crofts Solicitors and Patrick Green QC, has been given permission to intervene [join the case].

• Scotland’s lord advocate and Wales’s counsel general will be allowed to participate in the hearing.

• Aiden O’Neill QC, representing the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain, will argue that using the royal prerogative will undermine the “legislative competence” of the Scottish parliament.

• Lawyers for Great Britain, a pro-Brexit group led by Martin Howe QC, believe the result of the referendum should be implemented without further delay.

• Cases heard in Belfast on the constitutional impact of triggering article 50 will also be joined up to the dispute in the supreme court. The Northern Ireland attorney general, John Larkin QC, argues that the Good Friday peace agreement “has nothing to do with EU membership”. The unsuccessful challengers in the Belfast high court disagree with him.

Educated at Westminster School and studied chemistry at Oxford University, Lord Neuberger worked at a merchant bank before joining the bar. First judicial appointment as a recorder, a part time judge, in 1990. His wife’s pro-European tweets have led to Eurosceptic calls for him to stand aside from the case.

The most senior woman on the bench, studied law at Cambridge University, then lectured at Manchester University while practising as a barrister. She specialised in family and social welfare law, becoming a high court judge in 1994. A speech she delivered setting out the arguments ahead of the Article 50 case infuriated Brexiteers.

He read law at Oxford University and practised in Germany before becoming a recorder in 1993. He represented the UK on the Council of Europe’s Consultative Council of European Judges from 2000 to 2011. Lord Mance was forced to withdraw from giving a speech about justice in Europe in November because of political sensitivities ahead of the article 50 court case.

Formerly Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland, Kerr was educated at St Colman’s College, Newry, and read law at Queen’s University, Belfast. In 1993 he was appointed a high court judge. He was last the Law Lord appointed before the creation of the supreme court.

He specialised in maritime and commercial law at the bar and became a recorder in 1985. Clarke conducted the Marchioness and Bowbelle Inquiries and was appointed Master of the Rolls in 2005. He was the first justice to be appointed directly to the supreme court in 2009.

He read law at Oxford University and specialised in family law. Wilson was a high court judge in the family division and joined the supreme court in 2011.

After studying history at Oxford university, he became an academic and has continued to publish books on the Hundred Years War. He joined the bar in 1975 and apart from part time judicial roles, he continued to practise as a barrister until joining the court in 2012. He has served on the judicial appointments commissioner.

One of the two Scottish justices on the court, he studied law at Edinburgh University. Reed has sat as an ad hoc judge of the European court of human rights.

He studied law at Cambridge University, and served as attorney general to the Prince of Wales from 1988 to 1994. Carnwath has been chair of the Law Commission.

He became a crown court recorder in 1985 before progressing up through the judicial ranks. He joined the supreme court in 2013.

He is the other Scottish judge on the court. Hodge has served on the Scottish Law Commission and was one of the Scottish intellectual property judges. He joined the court in October 2013.

Last Wednesday 11 green leather seats were placed behind a semi-circular bench in court number one of the supreme court. Never before had 11 chairs been needed. The court has never before sat “en banc” – as a full bench of judges.

The seats were tagged with yellow Post-it stickers, the judges’ surnames scrawled on them so nobody could mistake where they were to sit. A teenage boy from a Belfast grammar, here on a school trip, stared at the stickers. Neuberger (David), president of the court, in the middle; his deputy, Hale (Brenda), to his right; Sumption (Jonathan), another well-known name, three down on the left. “Why is it the judges can overturn Brexit?” the teenager blurted out. His teacher wrung her hands. Had the boy paid more attention he’d know that judges had done no such thing. They are not concerned with politics but with upholding the rule of law.

The point of law at issue – to be examined again when the government’s appeal starts on Monday – is not whether Brexit can be triggered under article 50 of the Lisbon treaty, but how. What is the legal route?

The government claims it can act alone, without consulting parliament, citing prerogative powers wielded by the crown until the civil war, which they claim can still be used when international treaties are concerned.

Those challenging the government accept that article 50 is part of an international treaty, but argue that it is embedded in British law by the European Communities Act of 1972. Because of this, and because withdrawal directly affects the rights of British citizens, only parliament can trigger it. It was to preserve those rights that in 1648 parliament ordered the king’s head to be chopped off.

When the high court ruled against the government last month, Brexiteers, led by Nigel Farage’s Ukip, erupted in furore, and the Daily Mail declared the judges “enemies of the people” standing in the way of Brexit. And yet not only were the judges not obstructing Brexit, they were giving more power to parliament – which is what the out camp had called for throughout its campaign.

This week’s hearing is perhaps the most important constitutional case in 140 years. It has a significance far wider than Brexit. Not since 1876, when law lords first sat, have judges been asked to rule so broadly on who in Britain wields power. Unless the justices hold the line, asserting the sovereignty of parliament, tyranny of the majority threatens, according to human rights lawyers. “That tyranny today is embodied in the hyenas of the Daily Mail and the populist politicians both here and in the US, “ said Lord Lester, staunch campaigner for the removal of all crown powers. “I say make parliament the king.”

But it is precisely because the case is so important that the onslaught on the judges by the Mail, as well as the Murdoch press and Ukip, has been so extreme. Their attacks – made uglier because the judges cannot answer back – stem from the fear that if the supreme court upholds the earlier ruling, it might undermine the hard Brexit they wish for.

In a sense, these attacks have been no surprise – they are a continuation of the intemperate leave campaign’s stirring up of distrust of the liberal elite and its institutions. And the judges, though not all liberal, are certainly all part of the elite: with only one woman on the bench and no ethnic minorities, they have a long way to go to be truly representative.

Even so there is a wider context, because courts and judges are under attack around the world, as the populist surge spreads and accepted norms are discarded. Donald Trump plans to fill three potential vacancies in the supreme court with rightwing ideologues. And the international criminal court is being undermined by the desertion of a number of African countries, led by South Africa.

High on the Brexiteers’ complaints is that the judiciary is unaccountable. The Mail proposes that judges be elected, but this entirely misses the point of the British system, in which the judiciary, the third arm of government, must remain independent to enforce the rule of law without fear or favour.

This is not to say, however, that the judges can’t be accountable. In their own way they are. These are men and women who, as one lawyer put it, “deal in words” – analysing and weighing the words of earlier judges, and adapting their meaning for today. One could say therefore that they are answerable to judges past, to whose gowns were once cut from the same cloth and to whose words they owe a duty of care when considering or reproducing them – such as Sir Edward Coke, who in a 1610 case insisted: “The king hath no prerogative but that which the law of the land allows him.” Quoted in the high court judgment, Sir Edward will no doubt be heard again this week, as his guidance is sought by the supreme court.

The justices are embracing transparency as a way of being accountable too. It is now nearly 10 years since they left their home in the dingy committee rooms of the House of Lords to move into a rebranded supreme court building. This week’s hearing will be live-streamed on four channels, with an internal video link for those who cannot find a seat in the court itself. This openness may have increased the scrutiny of and hostility towards the judges themselves. Even so, transparency has been a good thing.

Though the attacks have been extraordinary and unprecedented, there are signs that the judges will not be cowed. Sitting “en banc” they have strength in numbers. They cannot be accused of fixing the result by selecting the most pro-European among them to hear the case. A carpenter has even extended the bench to make sure the 11th judge can squeeze in behind.

Once they have heard both sides, they will deliberate in private. Neuberger will give each judge a say, starting with the most recently appointed - those sitting on the outside edge of the bench - and working his way in. When the degree of consensus is clear, one will write the draft of the judgment, while others with dissenting views will write theirs. If possible, Neuberger will then seek to close the differences, achieving unanimity.

Hale and Neuberger are liberals and will be wary of overturning the earlier ruling, especially given the seniority of the judges in that case. Some say the two Scottish judges could be dissenters, as might Sumption, a known conservative. If he dissents, his arguments could be of sufficient intellectual calibre to win others round.

On the other hand, Sumption is also a medieval historian who knows how painstakingly the country has constructed its rule of law. It is said that Sumption has been outraged by the attacks on judges, and has been heard to warn that the very political order is in danger of collapse. In that case, he may prove the most independent of all.

As the 11 justices take their seats they will certainly be prepared for more attacks from the Mail and others. On Friday came the paper’s worst salvo yet, a carefully crafted set of slurs about the judges and their families, with sinister hints that far worse was yet to come. Saturday brought more external pressure as the critical arguments to be made to the supreme court by Jeremy Wright, the attorney general, were aired via an already hostile press.

This is unfair, and dangerous, for it is a testament to the judges’ independence that nobody really knows how they will rule. They have seats and stage directions, but the words will be entirely their own. The attorney general complained that the high court rendered Brexit itself a footnote. That is indeed how the supreme court should view the week ahead, for the stakes are now so much higher than Brexit.

As they rule, one hopes their words will demonstrate the true position. The independent judiciary is far from being the people’s enemy. It is – in fact – the people’s protector: our truest friend.

Theresa May has said the UK must not “turn our back” on the human rights abuses of foreign countries as she prepares to court Gulf states over a post-Brexit trade deal on a trip to Bahrain.

The prime minister has been urged by campaigners not to set aside human rights concerns in pursuit of a potentially lucrative free-trade arrangement with Middle-Eastern countries.

But May, who will become the first British leader and the first woman to attend the annual gathering of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) annual summit, said on Sunday that the UK must seek to “transform the way we do business” with the region.

“As the UK leaves the EU, we should seize the opportunity to forge a new trade arrangement between the UK and the Gulf,” she said. “This could transform the way we do business and lock in a new level of prosperity for our people.”

She added: “There will be some people in the UK who say we shouldn’t seek stronger trade and security ties with these countries because of their record on human rights. But we don’t uphold our values and human rights by turning our back on this issue. We achieve far more by stepping up, engaging with these countries and working with them.”

Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, and many Conservative MPs believe a trade deal with the Gulf could be one of the first the UK can seal post-Brexit. But the GCC member states – Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar – may demand visa-free travel in return.

The largest political party in Bahrain has been banned from the summit in Manama and both Bahrain and Saudi Arabia have been heavily criticised for their bombing campaign in the Yemen civil war.

In a letter sent to May and published on Sunday, groups including Human Rights Watch, Reprieve and the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy, said: “The Bahraini authorities’ orchestrated attack on the rights to free expression, assembly and association has seriously undermined the prospects of a political solution to Bahrain’s domestic unrest.

“If your government is serious about its commitment to encouraging reform and dialogue, you should use this influence to press the government of Bahrain to put an immediate stop to this repression.”

Critics such as Amnesty International claim that UK engagement in Bahrain, such as helping to train its judiciary and giving advice about a police complaints ombudsman, has not led to real change, but instead has become a PR fig leaf.

Despite having a free trade agreement with the European free trade area, the Gulf states have failed to strike a trade deal with the EU and talks with Brussels have in effect been on ice since 2008.

In 2015, British exports to the GCC were £22bn, higher than UK exports to China and more than double those to India.

May’s visit will coincide with an initiative by MPs to give UK authorities the power to seize assets of dictators and human rights abusers who buy luxury property in Britain to conceal their wealth.

A group of backbenchers are seeking to amend the criminal finances bill and to introduce a clause targeting those guilty of abusing human rights outside Britain. It would allow officials and groups such as Amnesty International to apply for an order freezing perpetrators’ UK assets.

The two-day GCC summit is likely to discuss whether it should form a tighter economic Gulf union, including a single market, single currency and customs union modelled on the EU.

Both Saudi Arabia and Bahrain have been pressing the idea of a Gulf Union since 2012, arguing that world insecurity, including the threat posed by Iran, makes the case for forming a large, more unified bloc. Huge democratic and social obstacles lie in front of the project, including concerns about loss of national sovereignty.

UK security and economic ties with Bahrain have been especially close and King Hamad of Bahrain extended the invitation to May, when he visited Downing Street in October. Prince Charles also visited Bahrain last month, along with Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, where he opened a wing of the new Royal Navy base, the construction of which has been funded by the King of Bahrain. During her visit the Duchess of Cornwall raised the issue of women’s rights and domestic violence, setting a bar for the prime minister.

But in a letter sent to May and published on Sunday the rights groups, including Human Rights Watch, Reprieve and the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy (BIRD), claim: “The Bahraini authorities’ orchestrated attack on the rights to free expression, assembly and association, has seriously undermined the prospects of a political solution to Bahrain’s domestic unrest.

“If your government is serious about its commitment to encouraging reform and dialogue, you should use this influence to press the government of Bahrain to put an immediate stop to this repression.”

In particular, the groups urge the prime minister to call for the release of arrested human rights defender Nabeel Rajab who has been held in solitary confinement in police custody since June 2016. Rajab is facing up to 15 years in prison on charges of insulting a neighbouring state, spreading rumours in wartime and insulting a statutory body. These charges relate to his criticism of the humanitarian cost of the war in Yemen, in which Bahrain is a participant, and for his documentation of torture in Bahrain’s Central Jau Prison. He faces another charge of defaming the state after he wrote a letter to the New York Times in September 2016.

Sheikh Ali Salman, the Shia leader of the largest opposition party, has been jailed for nine years.

The human rights abuses in Bahrain are a specific British concern, as the UK government has provided technical assistance since 2012 to help implement police and judicial reform.

The UK helped to set up two bodies – the Ombudsman of the Ministry of Interior and the Special Investigations Unit within the Public Prosecution Office, both of which receive training and capacity building support from the UK. Both were established in 2012 in the wake of the Bahraini government’s brutal crackdown on protests the previous year.

The foreign secretary Boris Johnson speaking on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show again insisted he was concerned about the Saudi-led bombing campaign in Yemen, saying he had spoken to the Saudi foreign minister about the issue only this weekend.

But Johnson said he believed the Saudi campaign did not represent a serious risk of war crimes violations and added that the UK was not involved in helping Saudi Arabia to set specific bomb targets.

Letters: When we boast of ‘justice of the people, by the people and for the people’ it is the magistrates who enable that
###########################################################
Your account of the continuing implosion of the magistrates courts system (Cuts and low morale trigger exodus of magistrates, 30 November) should be heeded urgently by the government and society generally.

It is not just the court closures (more than 10% already this year) and the disillusion which underlies an accelerating resignation of magistrates, but the profound impact on our civic culture. Unpaid justices of the peace, let us not forget, constitute the backbone of the criminal justice system, handling 90% of court cases (but costing only 1% of the courts and tribunals system’s budget). When we boast of “justice of the people, by the people and for the people”, it is the magistrates who enable that.

Further, loss of local courts means less willingness of citizens to come forward as witnesses (we are shortly to have but a single magistrates court in Suffolk). And local newspaper reporting of cases, which used to be a considerable deterrent to crime, has largely dried up. The loss of invaluable local knowledge by what were local presiding magistrates, and the declining “ownership” by local people of their courts and the justice system, are yet more blows to active citizenship and pride in community.

I sense that few in London understand much of all this. Thus a system widely admired and emulated is expiring, largely unnoticed.

Andrew Phillips

Liberal Democrat, House of Lords

• Having resigned as a magistrate six months ago, I would like to add some other factors discussed in your report.

Cuts to legal aid mean the majority of defendants now appear unrepresented. This leads to defendants either having to defend themselves, a task for which few are well equipped, or to plead guilty when they had a good case to make. Most people would prefer to plead guilty to avoid the £500 trial costs, and in many cases justice is not done. A lawyer would have taken a few moments to advise either a guilty or not guilty plea. On occasions I had to play the role of defence solicitor, asking questions of witnesses that a lawyer should have been asking.

The CPS is also under financial pressure to reduce hearings. This leads to lower-level charges being brought, for example in assault, to get a guilty plea and avoid a trial. The police are increasingly deploying fixed-penalty notices. Offences that once would have been brought to court, such as lesser public order incidents, are now dealt with like a speeding ticket. This asks a defendant to accept responsibility at a time when they may not be thinking clearly enough to make decisions. It may be cheap, but is it justice?

Cuts and privatisation of the probation service had led to a diminution of both their reporting to the court and in their ability to supervise and rehabilitate offenders. Reports that 12 years ago were full and written are now brief verbal reports based on a short interview. Finally, the state of our prisons is such that I felt increasingly unwilling to send people to prison, knowing that short-term prison sentences are ineffective in cutting crime.

Most people who come before magistrates are poor. Yet the basic disposal in these courts is the fine. Fining poor people is not only immoral and cruel but ineffective.

Nigel Reynolds

Mirfield, West Yorkshire

• As one of the many who resigned from the magistracy last year, after 15 years’ service, I was not surprised to read that more and more justices of the peace (JPs) are resigning. While one can understand the need for the judicial system to have appropriate rules and consistency for the administration of justice across the country, the restructuring, centralising and bureaucratisation of the magistracy seems to have done more harm than good.

The magistracy has a long and distinguished history of more than 650 years. One of its fundamental principles is that justice should be accessible and deliverable locally, by magistrates drawn from, and representative of, the local community that they serve. The rot started with the abolition of the local magistrates courts committees, followed by the closure of local courthouses and the establishment of so-called “centres of excellence”, where a specific courthouse in an area deals exclusively with one type of offending, such as domestic violence.

These “reforms”, coupled with reduced court resources, increased restrictions on JPs’ flexibility to use a commonsense approach in applying sentencing guidelines in the light of local communities’ circumstances and the nature of offending, and the introduction of the mandatory victim surcharge (which is just another form of taxation), are simply nails in the coffin.

It will surely not be long before local justice is dead and buried and everything is done online and by video link to “improve the experience of court users”. Since all criminal cases commence in magistrates courts, presumably the successive layers of the criminal court system above them will eventually suffer the same sort of technologically-based fate.

Successive ministers heading the Ministry of Justice have repeatedly told the magistracy about how much it is valued and what a critical role it has in the judicial system. Unfortunately, there is precious little evidence in support of such reassurance.

Paul Faupel

Somersham, Cambridgeshire

• Apart from the “exodus” of magistrates, I can identify another reason why the courts system is suffering a shortage of JPs. At the beginning of this year, my wife stood down from the magistracy after serving for 32 years. At the time of her resignation, she was the longest-serving magistrate in Leicestershire. She stood down because she had to, not because she wanted to. She had reached the age of 70, at which point all JPs are required to retire. Would not one answer to the shortage of magistrates be to abolish this arbitrary and inflexible retirement age and allow them to continue beyond 70? It seems bizarre, when fewer new recruits are coming forward, to allow this drain of talent and experience.

It is correct that “the government has already announced a plan to recruit 2,500 extra prison officers” (Deal raises hopes of end to prisons crisis, 2 December), but that will still leave the service 4,500 short of the staffing level it had four years ago. I’m awaiting a reply to a written question I have tabled seeking clarification of how many more staff will have to be appointed to replace the considerable number expected to leave the service in the next five years, believed to be in the region of 5,500.

The supreme court judges who will decide whether the government has the right to trigger article 50 without a parliamentary vote have been disgracefully vilified, according to the lead claimant in the case.



Gina Miller, whose dramatic victory in the high court led to accusations that she and the judiciary were trying to thwart the will of the people, also claimed newspaper coverage had incited violence against her.

Speaking to the Guardian before the first day of the government’s appeal against the decision, she said she could no longer travel on public transport, work in her office, or even spend a normal weekend with her family.

But she was most exercised about fresh attacks on the judges before the trial has begun.

“I think it is such a dangerous road to be going down to be attacking the judges and their integrity and their independence,” she added, arguing that they had a right and duty to operate independently of politicians and the media. “They are being vilified and it is totally disgraceful.”

Miller’s comments come as the attorney general, Jeremy Wright QC, prepares to assert the government’s authority to trigger Brexit and its supremacy over parliament in international affairs.

One of the most significant constitutional cases ever to be heard at the supreme court, starting on Monday, could also strain the UK’s devolution settlement as the Scottish and Welsh governments weigh in behind Miller.

With the most senior law officers in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland all taking part in proceedings, the government’s ability to push through far-reaching political changes that affect the rights of UK citizens in the devolved administrations without consulting parliament will also be challenged.

Miller criticised the coverage leading up to the case, which has included an article from the Daily Mail naming each of the judges and outlining their views, marital status, incomes and the cost of their family homes.

The article was headed: “11 unaccountable individuals will consider a case that could thwart the will of the majority on Brexit. The Mail makes no apology for revealing their views – and many have links to Europe.”

The coverage follows the newspaper’s controversial front page after the high court ruling in which it branded the three judges who made the decision “enemies of the people”.

Miller said she had received a letter from a man who said his elderly German mother, who had fled the Nazis, had told him the article had sent “shivers down her back” because it was so reminiscent of an Adolf Hitler claim in the 1930s.

Miller said she had been taken aback by the personal threats she had received as a result of taking the case.

“I don’t go anywhere – it has been a complete poisoned chalice,” she said, adding that she had made formal complaints about articles and comments attached to them.

“It is a crime to incite violence against someone,” she said, adding that politicians were also slow to criticise the attacks.



She said that newspaper guidelines did not allow journalists to write about people being “foreign-born” as they did about her, adding that she was a UK citizen from birth.

“You don’t see ‘foreign-born Boris Johnson’,” she added, calling it “disgraceful”.

But Miller said she had no regrets because of the scale of support she had received including hundreds of messages from people who had experienced hate crime on the street.

“I’ve had stories of people speaking another language at a bus stop and being spat on and kicked – it’s horrifying.”

Miller argued that the case was not about stopping Brexit, but simply ensuring that a precedent was not set under which the government could bypass parliament on any issue it chose.

She also said she was baffled that the government had taken the case to the supreme court, because that had allowed the Scottish and Welsh governments to raise the devolution settlement. They had added unnecessary “twists and turns”, she said.

Miller said the key was that Britain did not have a written constitution so triggering article 50 without a parliamentary vote would set a dangerous precedent. “We would be undoing 400 years of democracy and sovereignty if the government were allowed to use this royal prerogative,” she said.

It came as a lawyer representing the second claimant, Deir Dos Santos – who voted for Brexit, called for calm ahead of the hearing, warning that security guards had been called in because of the threat.

David Greene, a solicitor with Edwin Coe LLP, who represents Dos Santos, said: “It is a sad day when space needs to be made at the highest civil court for security guards for parties and party anonymity is required to protect litigants seeking their legitimate right to bring this matter to court.

“The Santos and Miller claim is and has always been about the process for exit from the EU. No more no less. Many see it as an attempt to forestall the exit but Mr Santos voted for Brexit and supports that goal. 



“He and we call for calm ahead of the hearing and the decision ... Neither the parties, including my client, nor judges, are the enemies of the people. The court process and an independent judiciary are the hallmark of a democracy. It would be a sad day indeed when an executive can ride roughshod over the judiciary, portrayed as anti-democratic. To the contrary, we should be celebrating the court process and the rule of law.” 



A senior government legal source said their approach would be to stress the wider constitutional importance of the case, which could have an impact on the use of the royal prerogative in future matters of foreign affairs and defence. 



It is understood ministers felt the first hearings had been framed too much by the claimants going first, but the order will be reversed in the appeal, giving the government the opportunity to shape its case in a different way while making essentially the same argument.

The legal source said the government would have been unlikely to defend the case so vigorously if it was just about one parliamentary vote on triggering article 50, which ministers are confident they would win.

However, there is a strong feeling about the point of principle that the royal prerogative should be preserved for such decisions to prevent future parliamentary votes about every single change involving international treaties.

Ministers are already considering the possibilities for legislation to preserve the royal prerogative if the ruling goes against the government, meaning the executive would much more frequently have to consult parliament on international affairs.

Both the Welsh and Scottish governments will argue that the earlier high court judgment, which said that only parliament had the power to trigger article 50, should be upheld. 



The counsel general for Wales, Mick Antoniw, said: “While Brexit will happen, the UK government cannot trigger it by overriding the British constitution. We heard a lot about ‘taking back control’ during the referendum campaign. Ignoring the governance arrangements of the UK is not a good start to that process.

“Leaving the EU will lead to significant changes to the devolution settlement in Wales. Only the UK parliament can make those changes, which should be with the agreement of the national assembly for Wales. The UK government does not have the power to short-circuit this important mechanism for dialogue between the democratically elected national assembly for Wales and the UK parliament by using the prerogative in this way.”

Most legal opinion is convinced that since the government has not changed its main line of reasoning, it will lose in the supreme court, where 11 justices will consider the case. Prof Michael Zander QC said last week that ministers could be defeated 11-0.

However, Trevor Tayleur, associate professor at the University of Law, argued that the government would be much better placed to make its arguments this time around.

He said the key argument would be that the 1972 European Communities Act had not created new laws but simply acted as a channel to bring European rights into the UK.

He said the government losing would only delay article 50, rather than stop it, but argued that it would show “that the courts are willing to become more assertive in their relationship with the executive”.

These are not easy days to be a feminist in America. The film industry, as well as other progressives in American society, are still reeling over the election of a man who admits to having sexually assaulted women, knowingly using his celebrity to exploit them. Over the last several days a video surfaced (thank you, Elle) from a 2013 interview with the Academy-Award-winning Italian director Bernardo Bertolucci, in which he talks about how he and Marlon Brando conspired to film a rape scene involving butter with the actress Maria Schneider on the set of the Last Tango in Paris, a film that was nominated for two Academy Awards and many other accolades.

It’s important to note that Schneider, who died in 2011, told the Daily Mail in an interview way back in 2007 that she “felt humiliated and, to be honest, I felt a little raped, both by Marlon and by Bertolucci”. Although the rape scene was simulated, stories differ as to what Schneider was told in advance of the shoot. What is not in doubt is that a 19-year-old was blindsided by a bunch of older men who, according to Bertolucci, “wanted her reaction as a girl, not as an actress”.

This woman said she was “a little bit raped” almost a decade ago yet there was no response, no outcry, like there was this weekend. The common theme is that we continue to disbelieve women who are assaulted. It took over 50 women to come forward for the world to believe that Bill Cosby might have been sexually assaulting women for decades. People (even our best and most feminist actresses) still have no problem working with Roman Polanski or Woody Allen, and others whom the world knows have multiple issues with women. And, by the way, Bertolucci was one of the signers of a 2009 petition demanding that Polanski be released from Switzerland while the US was trying to extradite him.

It took Bertolucci admitting to facilitating the rape scene and saying that he “felt guilt but not regret” over what he did for people to believe Schneider, who unfortunately is no longer here to realise the benefits of his confession. Neither is Brando, who according to the reports was also traumatised by what happened. If you read what happened to Schneider after making the film, the suicide attempts and drug problems which were attributed at the time to the onslaught of fame, in hindsight we can see that this woman had PTSD (something that is common with people who have suffered from rape and other traumas) because she had to cover up her own violation and it tortured her for the rest of her life.

The fact that Bertolucci has no “regret” over the scene – because I guess he thought in a warped and unacceptable way that she wouldn’t be able to act like she was being violated if she knew it was coming – belies a complete lack of responsibility. Say “I was wrong and I shouldn’t have done it”. Own it. You made a career as a result of this film, off the back of a woman whom you conspired to mislead for your own interests. She was a 19-year-old actress and you could – and should – have trusted her to do her job on that scene, just like you trusted her to do in other scenes. Maybe you didn’t tell her because she would have said no, and you didn’t want to deal with that?

It would be a different story if this sad tale of Maria Schneider were an isolated incident in the film community – but it’s not. The so-called progressive community of Hollywood hides behind its liberal values while paying men more, not hiring women in equal numbers, sexualising women, kicking women out when they are no longer “fuckable” and, yes, raping them. Rose McGowan and Tippi Hedren are two women actors who have been vocal about their own sexual assaults.

Rape is used as a device in TV and films with such regularity that we are almost immune to it. It is used over and over again in one of the most contentious movies of this awards season, Elle. For those who haven’t seen it, Isabelle Huppert’s character is raped multiple times in the film. There have been a variety of differing opinions related to the “grey area” of whether her character is complicit with her rape. Huppert is no Schneider in this piece. She knew exactly what she was getting into and is winning accolades for the film; she won a Gotham Award last week.

For me there is no grey area. Rape is rape. The stats suggest that between 90-98% of rape survivors tell the truth, yet rape is a felony where the victim is often disbelieved and in turn the conviction rate is absurdly low. When any movie tries to create nuance over an issue that is an epidemic in our culture, we all need to stand up. Movies are not just movies. They are touchstones, reflections of our culture of where we are, of who we all want to be.

• This article was amended on 7December 2016 to remove the impression that the rape scene in Last Tango in Paris was not simulated.

Something very strange is going on. The chairman of the Equality and Human Rights Commission feels he must tell employers it is OK to celebrate Christmas, and that this will not offend unbelievers. The prime minister announces in parliament that of course people should be able to speak freely about their religious convictions. A thinktank argues that there should be a duty of “reasonable accommodation” to religious belief. All these are symptoms of a deep unease and confusion about the role of Christianity in British life.

Britain is a country with an established church in England and another national church in Scotland, a secular ruling class, and a population largely indifferent to distinctively Christian beliefs and overwhelmingly reluctant to go to church, which displays a growing hostility to the notion of “religion” at all. There are also significant religious minorities, primarily Muslim, who have their own arguments with secularism as well as with Christianity.

Some churches see their control of schools as a way back towards relevance, and the government is tempted by the idea that Christian-based schooling produces better results than the purely secular, even though the best research suggests that faith works in practice simply as a proxy for selection on the basis of class and parental wealth.

Much of the noise is based around the tendentious claim that conservative Christians who are prevented from discriminating against gay people are thereby discriminated against. The argument is hardly convincing. Although there were important issues of free speech involved in the case of Ashers bakery in Belfast, and in some other recent cases that did not come to court, Christians are not being persecuted if they are prevented from exercising their beliefs in ways that harm others. Neither are the followers of any other religion.

These prohibitions are not purely the imposition of secular law on religious believers. They are also the imposition of one kind of religious belief on another. There are people motivated by equally sincere and (theologically speaking) equally well-argued religious convictions on both sides of all these debates.

What is more, the conservative Christian case is fundamentally compromised when it is pitched in terms of “religious” freedom rather than what is actually meant, which is that the law of the land should follow specifically Christian principles. Religion is notoriously hard to define, as is secularism. Deciding which kinds of belief deserve special protection even if none are to be treated as theologically true turns out to be very complicated. Unfortunately it is also necessary. It is impossible to construct a nation or any community without shared moral values and practices, and surprisingly difficult to decide, as it were, from first principles, how to move these values beyond platitudes and into action. There is in some secularist discussions an unwarranted assumption that all real disagreement is political, whereas religious opinions are distinguished by being either platitudinous or false. In fact they can be inextricably tangled, and the religious aspect can make political disputes much harder to resolve.

And here the Christian critique has something to offer the rest of the country. There is a long tradition of religious thought about the development of virtues and values. The Christian version derives ultimately from Socrates and Aristotle, but those philosophers thought virtue was entirely compatible with slavery and infanticide, so it has been quite heavily modified since then. The central insight is that both individuals and societies, or social groups, develop their values by living them. Moral questions cannot be answered entirely by reasoning: we discover what kind of creatures we are by living; we develop virtues, like vices, by practising them. A compassionate society is one that treats its members compassionately, not one that makes speeches about the need to do so.

More subtly, the values of a society are developed and maintained by its institutions. These need not be branches of the state. In fact it’s essential that many of them aren’t. Trade unions, food banks, football leagues, even reading groups all qualify, but many will always be religious. It would be stupid and self-destructive to make such groups feel useless and unwanted. The nervousness over Christmas, or even over expressing religious belief, is an absurd expression of a real void at the heart of soulless technocracy.

My brother Sir Mota Singh, who has died aged 86, was the first ethnic minority judge in England when he was appointed in 1982. He forsook the traditional judge’s wig for a turban when sitting at Southwark crown court, London, where he served for more than 20 years.

He was born in Nairobi, Kenya, the eldest of seven children – he had five brothers and a sister – of Dalip Singh Matharu, a garage proprietor, and his wife, Harnam. Aged 16 Mota was forced to assume responsibility for the family when his father was fatally wounded while defending a woman from an attack.

Academically gifted, he was encouraged by his teachers to complete his education, despite being the family breadwinner. He took a clerical position with a firm of advocates in Nairobi and then enrolled with Lincoln’s Inn, London, as a foreign student.

In 1953, accompanied by his wife, Swaran, and young daughter, he set sail from Mombasa for London to complete his bar exams. He continued to work during the day, as a clerk at the Indian high commission.

He returned to Kenya in 1955 and began to practise at the bar. He soon established himself as one of the country’s leading advocates and was often instructed in proceedings involving the Kenyan government. In 1962 he was the first non-European advocate to be appointed secretary of the Law Society of Kenya.

Despite the prospect of a bright legal career in Nairobi, he emigrated to the UK in 1965, determined to practise at the English bar. Soon the scale of his challenge became clear. After six months of failed attempts to obtain a tenancy in chambers, he was compelled to seek alternative employment and accepted an offer to be in-house legal adviser to a national property company. He thrived, and eventually secured a tenancy at 1 Mitre Court, Middle Temple, to begin practising at the bar.

Mota became a specialist in landlord and tenant disputes, and the counsel of choice for leading property companies, but his first brief, from his brother Manmohan Singh, a solicitor, was to represent a client on a drink-driving charge, which he successfully defended alongside his brother. The image of two Sikh lawyers in tailored suits and crisply starched white turbans captured the media’s imagination at the time.

In 1968 Mota was appointed as a member of the Race Relations Board. He took silk in 1976 and three years later was appointed recorder; then a crown court judge in 1982. At Southwark crown court he was one of four judges nominated by the lord chancellor to try serious fraud cases.

A devout Sikh, he would rise at two each morning to begin his daily prayer routine and yoga exercises. He also served as a trustee of charitable organisations including Barnado’s, the Windsor Leadership Trust and the Democracy Forum. In 2012 he was knighted for services to the legal profession and to charity.

He is survived by Swaran and their three children, Pam, Satinder and Jaswinder.

My female friends and colleagues, online and off, have been bleakly unimpressed this weekend by a recent display of bland and worldly impenitence from Bernardo Bertolucci about how he created the “butter” scene in the 1972 film Last Tango in Paris, starring Marlon Brando and Maria Schneider. But they are still more unimpressed about the resulting liberal horror, as if this was a bizarre and scandalous one-off, and not simply yet another detail in the colossal architecture of male power in the movies and everywhere else.

Hollywood’s Captain America star Chris Evans tweeted: “This is beyond disgusting. I feel rage.” Jessica Chastain tweeted: “To all the people that love this film - you’re watching a 19-year-old get raped by a 48-year-old man. The director planned her attack. I feel sick.”

I felt this nausea because like everyone else, in my naivety, I had assumed that Bertolucci had discussed and rehearsed this scene with Brando and Schneider on equal terms, in advance of shooting. This was the shocking moment when Brando’s character Paul brutally penetrates Schneider’s character Jeanne using a stick of butter.

But in recently-surfaced video of an onstage event in 2013, Bertolucci announced that he did not tell Maria Schneider what was going to happen before the take; he and Brando had secretly planned it without her knowledge because the director wanted her humiliation to be real. Two powerful men, aged 32 and 48, had arranged for her to be assaulted. For Maria Schneider herself, it was something more akin to actual physical assault: “I felt humiliated and to be honest, I felt a little raped.” Bertolucci’s Wikipedia page is now getting hammered to this effect.

I myself last wrote about the film in 2007, when Last Tango in Paris was re-released in the UK. I had always believed that the scene was only 50 percent of the film’s meaning - and that the point was that Paul wanted Jeanne to do the same thing back to him: to be painfully penetrated with her fingers, and that his humiliation resided further in being old – that remark about his prostate. In the fictional world of the movie there is a kind of consent, albeit of a loaded kind.

Well, we now know that there was no consent in real life. Whatever balancing moments existed in the story, Bertolucci certainly never discussed anything with Schneider without telling Brando. It was all the other way around. The power lay with the famous director and famous actor. As Chastain says, we are left with disgust.

Hollywood history is full of these iceberg-tips of abuse peeping out. Everyone knows about the big cases: the conviction and exile of Roman Polanski, the (denied and unproven) accusation of Woody Allen. But there is also a vast unacknowledged history of normalised abuse - virtually every female star and many male stars have endured a casting-couch assault, although the MO has of course been offscreen. In his effrontery, Bertolucci put his abuse in front of the camera and like so many men of that era, maintains a tacit claim of permissive liberation and declines to see what was wrong.

Amy Berg’s documentary, An Open Secret, has disclosed the range of child abuse in the film industry. Corey Haim and Todd Bridges have revealed they were assaulted as children, a toxic and hateful pattern of power and manipulation which is part of that same continuum of abuse which reaches to the adult world.

To speak out takes courage. In 1937, a dancer named Patricia Douglas accused studio executive David Ross of rape at a party given by MGM chief Louis B Mayer. Instead of staying silent, she filed a complaint in the LA County district attorney’s office. And a brutal campaign to discredit her was then created by studio fixer Eddie Mannix. Witnesses were bribed to change their stories. The male establishment of the law, politics and the press ganged up and Douglas’s career was crushed although her courage in taking on the system has since made her a heroine.

More recently, Thandie Newton has described her own outrage at this abuse happening as part of the panoply of Hollywood power - just as it did with Schneider. A certain male director was sneeringly boasting to her about having seen a lewd audition videotape another director had made Newton do when she was a struggling young actor.

In 2016, as in 1972, and 1937, there are plenty of disgusting men in the movie industry who don’t see what the problem is. Now they are being forced to confront the poison they have created.

Dangerous drivers who kill while using a mobile phone at the wheel could face life sentences under plans unveiled by ministers, bringing the punishment in line with those charged with manslaughter.

Motorists who cause death by speeding or street racing, or through careless driving while under the influence of alcohol or drugs, could also be handed life sentences if proposals to increase the 14-year limit for the offence are adopted.

Under the current penalty, people are usually released after seven years. In 2015, the average sentence for drivers who killed was 45.6 months, or less than four years.

The justice minister Sam Gyimah said the maximum sentence should rise to a life term.

“Killer drivers ruin lives,” he said. “Their actions cause immeasurable pain to families, who must endure tragic, unnecessary losses. While [it is] impossible to compensate for the death of a loved one, we are determined to make sure the punishment fits the crime.

“My message is clear: if you drive dangerously and kill on our roads, you could face a life sentence.”

Last year, 122 people were convicted of causing death by dangerous driving, including those who were speeding, street racing and using a mobile phone. A further 21 people were convicted of causing death by careless driving while under the influence.

A Ministry of Justice consultation will seek views on whether the current maximum penalty available to the courts should be increased.

As well as plans to increase the maximum sentence of causing death by dangerous driving, or careless driving, to a life term, the proposals include creating a new offence of causing serious injury by careless driving, which would carry a maximum sentence of three years.

The MoJ will also consider increasing the minimum driving bans for those convicted of causing death on the roads.

Road safety campaigners welcomed the proposals, but said ministers should go further in punishing what the RAC described as an “epidemic” of motorists texting, checking messages and making calls while driving.

Gary Rae, the campaigns director for road safety charity Brake, said: “This is a vindication of our efforts, and those of victims’ families, calling for change through our roads to justice campaign. For too long, the justice system has treated them as second-class citizens.”

But he said there were concerns that the charge of “careless” driving remained. “Some of the strongest feedback we have received from the families we work with is that there is nothing careless about taking someone else’s life,” he said.

“We also want clarification on whether the current automatic 50% discount, where convicted drivers serve only half their jail term, will still apply for these new, proposed sentences.”

Last week, a lorry driver was sentenced to six years in prison for killing two men when he ploughed into them four seconds after using Facebook.

Keith Mees, 49, had been sending a message to his girlfriend saying he was splitting up with her when he drove into a line of traffic, crushing Marian Olteanu, 35, and Ion Calin, 42, to death. He had also been streaming YouTube videos and chatting on the phone.

The Department for Transport has increased the punishment for those using a mobile at the wheel.

The fine rose from £100 to £200 and penalty points doubled from three to six, so those found to be offending on more than one occasion will reach the 12-point threshold for a ban.

Letters: When we boast of ‘justice of the people, by the people and for the people’ it is the magistrates who enable that
###########################################################
It’s an October afternoon at the Royal Courts of Justice, central London. In a high-ceilinged, stone-floored corridor, barristers in black gowns and white wigs flick through fat files. A trio of dark-suited solicitors talk in low tones. The word “redacted” drifts up out of their conversation.



A few yards away, there’s a room with a very different picture. A man in a worn leather jacket is getting help filling in a form. Another, in his 50s, is on the phone trying to get a copy of a court order. This is the Personal Support Unit (PSU), a charity that helps litigants in person (LIPs), people going to court without lawyers or barristers. PSU volunteers explain procedures and forms, but don’t give legal advice. As an LIP, reading up on the law and presenting your case to a judge is down to you.

The stress of resorting to the law can be so great that, win or lose, most people are glad to walk away when it’s done. But not always. Some LIPs come back for more and carry on fighting their corner when most would have given up long ago. They believe that if only they could find the right judge, the right loophole in the law or the right bit of evidence, they will get justice. And then, almost without noticing it, the law has become their life.

“I’ve been a litigant in person for more than 20 years,” says 71-year- old Maurice Kirk. “My cases have taken over my life. They’ve cost me my family, my health and my qualifications as a veterinary surgeon. Twenty years – I never thought it would last this long.”

Kirk, a qualified pilot who recently flew across Africa in a vintage air rally, says he’s currently fighting “about 15” court cases. Twelve are part of his 24-year dispute with South Wales police. He admits he has become obsessive about taking the police to court. “But I won’t give up because I know I’m right,” he says. The legal battles stem from “a campaign of harassment and bullying” which he says started in 1992, when he moved to Barry in the Vale of Glamorgan to open a veterinary practice.

“I was constantly stopped for motoring offences,” he says. He admits there were also high-speed car chases and a fine for resisting a police officer. Stung by what he saw as continued injustice, following previous run-ins with the police in Guernsey, Kirk started to go to court to get his convictions overturned.

“I was forced to be a litigant in person because the lawyers I employed proved thoroughly disappointing,” he says.

Kirk blamed South Wales police when he was removed from the register of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons (RCVS) in 2002 for unprofessional behaviour. The RCVS cited his 11 convictions among the reasons for striking him off. Kirk applied to go back on the RCVS register several times, always representing himself at hearings. They turned him down.

He changed tactics. “I thought if I could prove the police had treated me badly, I might be able to go back on the register as a vet,” he says. He decided to sue South Wales police for damages, but preparations were interrupted when he was charged with the illegal possession and sale of a Lewis machine gun.

Kirk, who already had convictions for assault, spent eight months on remand until a Cardiff Crown Court trial in 2010. He defended himself. The jury found him not guilty.

The damages case came to court in 2013. “I’d been preparing for this since the 90s,” says Kirk. “There were a lot of witnesses to find and interview. I hired a private investigator to trace some of them.”

Kirk represented himself in 47 days of hearings. He was allowed damages for two of 33 incidents, but the judge ruled there was no conspiracy. Kirk is preparing an appeal. South Wales police said: “It would be inappropriate to comment” as proceedings were continuing.”

“I used to be terrified of going to court,” says Elizabeth Watson, “but I’ve had no option. Like most litigants in person I was forced into it.” Bournemouth company director Watson is fighting the Bank of Scotland for her home. The bank says she owes them more than £345,000. She says she doesn’t owe them a penny. “Something like this – it comes in and it invades your life,” says Watson. “It dominates the landscape. It’s like a rotting corpse.”

What Watson calls her “life hijack” started in 2002 when she put money into an investment scheme run by Leicester accountants Dobb White. She says she was told it had the backing of senior people at the Bank of Scotland. The bank lent her £345,000 to invest in the scheme, but it was a fraud. Investors in the UK and US lost over $200m – around £165m at current rates. The Bank of Scotland came after Watson – and other investors – for their money.

Watson had been an LIP before. “They were silly things, though. A dry cleaner ruined a cream suit I had, so I took her to court for compensation.” Watson won these early cases. But going up against a bank with a full legal team has been very different. “There’s no equality of arms. It feels like a rigged game,” she says. Watson has now been to court “over 20 times”, with the case lasting eight years so far. The court file – in one judge’s estimation – runs to over 1,000 pages. “At the beginning I felt very bewildered.”

Although she has sometimes had legal help, Watson has done most of the work herself. She’s taken it all the way to the court of appeal and the supreme court. The bank won possession of her house in July 2015. Her attempt to appeal against that decision was dismissed in May this year. The judge criticised her for the way she’d run her case and gave her a limited civil restraint order. This stops her from taking any further action in the case without first getting permission from a judge. The Bank of Scotland is currently trying to make her bankrupt. Bankruptcy can effectively stop someone from pursuing civil action.

A Bank of Scotland spokesman said the bank “at no point provided advice or recommendations to customers about the Dobb White scheme”. He added: “Repossession is always a last resort,” and that the bank hoped, “we could still work with Mr and Mrs Watson to agree a resolution to this issue.”

Peter Oakes has sued – or attempted to sue – the police, council officials and other public servants. He says he’s been to court “about 20 times” over the past 18 years.

“I’ve never won a case,” says 72-year-old Oakes, who lives in Crewe. “But I’ve had to keep going. My experience has unglued everything I believed in. Once you fall foul of an official body, it seems all the others conspire against you.”

Oakes says his battles with officialdom started in the United States in 1991 when he owned a company selling aquarium supplies. A dispute over money with a client in Florida led to Oakes being arrested by local police and eventually found guilty on a charge of criminal trespass. He was fined $400.

Oakes insists he was innocent of any wrongdoing, so it’s understandable he felt unfairly treated by the US legal system. But he was also convinced he’d been let down by the British authorities.

“The Foreign Office did nothing,” he says. “They didn’t lift a finger in any shape or form to help me.”

Oakes’s feelings of injustice drove him to read up on the law. He hit on a clause in the Criminal Justice Act 1948, which he believed meant that British officials could be prosecuted for not carrying out their duties abroad.

“I reported [a Foreign Office official in Florida] to Cheshire police for misconduct in a public office,” he says. The police declined to investigate, so Oakes sued them for “failing to carry out their duties”. A judge threw the case out.

In protest, Oakes refused to pay the portion of his council tax that went to police services. His local authority, Crewe and Nantwich (now part of Cheshire East council), took him to court. He represented himself.

“My defence was under the Trade Descriptions Act. I wasn’t getting the services from the police, so I wasn’t paying the money,” he says.

Magistrates ordered him to pay up. He refused. Representing himself at a later hearing, he attempted a citizen’s arrest on a council official. That led to conviction for assault and two months in prison. The local authority eventually bankrupted him in 2010 for unpaid council tax and court costs. Oakes and his wife Jean had to remortgage their house to raise cash to annul the bankruptcy. “She doesn’t usually get involved, but she’s always been very supportive,” says Oakes.

Other fallout from his court cases include more convictions, for assault and harassment, and another two months in jail – as well as the belief that “the establishment is corrupt”. Oakes has had some sympathy from “the establishment” during his battles. A judge once told him that he “was satisfied that he has suffered cruelly over a number of years”.

“When all this started, people said to me, ‘You’re paranoid,’” says Oakes. “I’m not bloody paranoid. But when officials get something wrong, they don’t put their hands up and say they’re sorry, they just come back at you.”

Oakes now helps other LIPs with their cases. He’s also writing a book about his experiences. The Foreign Office said they did not comment on details of consular cases or individual members of staff. Cheshire police said they could not comment as they only hold records of civil cases for six years.

When she was sentenced to seven years for fraud, Julia McClaren found the civil law becoming a large part of her life .

The former theatre producer went to court from prison when a cattery that had been looking after her cats, Arthur and Bella, gave them away without her permission.

“I was furious,” says McClaren. “I don’t have kids; I’ve never wanted kids. Those cats are my family. They mean more to me than anything.”

Arthur and Bella had been living with McClaren’s 83-year-old mother while she had been serving her sentence, but she’d been admitted to hospital after she fell and broke a hip. A social worker then lodged the two animals in a local cattery. But when McClaren sent a friend to pick them up, the cattery wouldn’t let her take them.

“They tried to make out that I’d breached their contract by not paying the bills,” says McClaren. “I wrote to them and pointed out that they’d never sent me any bills. And then they’d stopped my authorised representative from collecting them.”

Then McClaren heard the cattery had given away Arthur and Bella to Susan 

 Watkins, one of their employees.

“They’d helped themselves to my property,” says McClaren. “And they thought they could do that because I was in prison. I just wanted them to be forced to admit that they should never have done it.”

McClaren’s first stop was the library at HMP Downview, a women’s prison in 

 Sutton, Surrey.

She started to read up on contract law. “There were only about three books on the subject. And they were all way out of date. But the principles hadn’t changed. I looked at it all and thought to myself: ‘This is the perfect way of sticking it to them.’

“Cats are considered property under the law,” explains McClaren, who had been to court as a litigant in person before this case. “As property, they are owned by somebody. I believed that the cattery had breached my rights by giving the cats – my property – away to this woman.”

McClaren drafted detailed paperwork setting out why she thought the cattery was in the wrong and then started proceedings.

At court – which McClaren was taken to and from in a prison van – the two sides came to an agreement. The cats could stay with Susan Watkins for the moment, but McClaren would make arrangements for a friend to collect them.

However, Watkins refused to give the cats up, so when McClaren was finally released from prison nine months later, she went back to court. “At the hearing, Watkins went on that I was a bad person and that the cats would suffer if they were moved,” says McClaren. “I just pointed out that they belonged to me, not her.”

The judge agreed. He ordered that Arthur and Bella had to be handed over the following day – in the car park of a local supermarket.

“I have to say there was a rather petty sense of self-satisfaction of sticking one up to them,” says McClaren. “But I’d made my point. Just because someone is in jail, it doesn’t mean that they lose their property or their rights.”

Some names have been changed

Comments by the director of the film Last Tango in Paris, Bernardo Bertolucci, that he conspired with Marlon Brando to film a graphic rape scene without the consent of 19-year-old actor Maria Schneider have prompted outrage in Hollywood.



Speaking in a video from 2013 that surfaced recently, Bertolucci said he and Brando came up with the idea to shoot the infamous scene depicting assault, in which Brando’s character uses a stick of butter to anally rape his lover, played by Schneider.

“The sequence of the butter is an idea that I had with Marlon in the morning before shooting,” Bertulocci said at an event held at La Cinémathèque Française in Paris in 2013. He said he “wanted her reaction as a girl, not as an actress”.



“I think she hated me and also Marlon because we didn’t tell her that there was that detail of the butter used as lubricant,” he said.

Although he admitted that not telling her the plan was “horrible”, Bertolucci said he didn’t regret how he decided to direct the scene.

Last Tango in Paris – which was made in 1972 and tells the story of a man who enters into an anonymous affair after his wife takes her own life – shocked audiences when it was released due to its graphic depictions of sex and rape and is still considered to be controversial. At the time of filming Brando was 48, while Schneider was 19.

Schneider, who went on to have serious drug addiction problems and depression, said in 2007 that she felt humiliated and “a little raped”. During the interview Schneider confirmed the scene was simulated and there was no real sex.

She said she was told about the contents of the scene shortly before the shoot and that it wasn’t in the original script.

“I was so angry, she said. “I should have called my agent or had my lawyer come to the set because you can’t force someone to do something that isn’t in the script, but at the time, I didn’t know that,” she told the Daily Mail.

“Marlon said to me: ‘Maria, don’t worry, it’s just a movie’.”

“After the scene, Marlon didn’t console me or apologise. Thankfully, there was just one take,” she said. Schneider died from cancer in 2011.

Bertolucci’s comments prompted outrage on social media, with celebrities among those calling for the director to be stripped of his awards or to be prosecuted.

Jessica Chastain said the comments made her feel sick.



Evan Rachel Wood retweeted Chastain’s comments, adding, “I second that. This is heartbreaking and outrageous. The 2 of them are very sick individuals to think that was ok.”

Chris Evans wrote: “Wow. I will never look at this film, Bertolucci or Brando the same way again. This is beyond disgusting. I feel rage,” which prompted a response from Anna Kendrick.

“Ms Schneider stated this several years ago. I used to get eye-rolls when I brought it up to people (aka dudes),” Kendrick tweeted. Evans replied that the men should be in jail.

Dangerous drivers who kill are set to face life sentences under plans put forward by ministers. Those causing death by speeding, street racing or while using a mobile phone will face the same sentences as people charged with manslaughter.

Offenders who cause death by careless driving while under the influence of drink or drugs could also be handed life sentences – an increase on the current 14-year upper limit.

“Killer drivers ruin lives,” said justice minister Sam Gyimah. “Their actions cause immeasurable pain to families, who must endure tragic, unnecessary losses. While impossible to compensate for the death of a loved one, we are determined to make sure the punishment fits the crime.”

A Ministry of Justice consultation will seek views on whether the current maximum penalties available to the courts should be increased. The department said that the new measures would see custodial sentences for causing death by careless or dangerous driving increase from an average of 45.8 months in 2015.

Proposals include increasing the maximum sentence for causing death by either dangerous or by careless driving from 14 years to life, and creating a new offence of causing serious injury by careless driving, which would carry a maximum sentence of three years. There are also proposals to increase the minimum driving bans for those convicted of causing death.

The department says the consultation delivers on the government’s pledge to consider the sentencing powers available to the courts for the most serious driving offences. In 2015, 122 people were sentenced for causing death by dangerous driving, with a further 21 convicted of causing death by careless driving while under the influence.

This week, the supreme court of the United Kingdom will hear the government’s article 50 appeal in what promises, with its live TV coverage and internet streaming, to be the court’s most contentious and closely followed case since its establishment seven years ago.

At that time, there were many critics of the new court, which replaced the law lords as the country’s highest court. Chief among them was the then law lord Lord Neuberger, who dismissed the court as the creation of a “last-minute decision over a glass of whisky”. He feared that the British constitution was being dangerously “muck[ed] around” and noted that there was a pronounced risk of “judges arrogating to themselves greater power than they have at the moment”.

David Neuberger, Baron Neuberger of Abbotsbury, appears to have since overcome his doubts about the supreme court, at least to the extent of becoming, four years ago, its president.

The sovereignty of parliament is the issue at the heart of the article 50 case. Both sides lay claim, in different ways, to be defending it. The government insists that, as the parliamentary executive, acting on the will of people as expressed in the referendum on European Union membership, it has the right to invoke article 50 without a parliamentary debate and vote.

The government’s opponents, namely Gina Miller, Deir Tozetti Dos Santos and others, have argued that, as the referendum is not binding under existing law, the government is legally obliged to ratify the result with a vote in parliament.

Only parliament, they maintain, can remove the rights that parliament enshrined in the 1972 European Communities Act.

The high court agreed with Miller and co and, as a result, the three judges involved in that decision found themselves denounced on the front page of the Daily Mail as “enemies of the people” and as “judicial activists” by Ukip.

Suddenly, the British judiciary was in the dock, with public confidence in the constitutional role of our senior judges brought into question. Although the supreme court’s job is simply to interpret and pass judgment on the law, its president will be keen to demonstrate the disinterested position of his court.

And to combat any notion of a restrictive view, for the first time in its short history, all 11 justices of the supreme court will hear an appeal. The maximum is usually nine. The justices are not, as Neuberger has attested, a study in social diversity – they’re all white, nine out of 11 were privately educated and 10 out of 11 are men.

Many legal experts are predicting an unambiguous government loss. Michael Zander, emeritus professor of law at the London School of Economics, wrote recently in the legal magazine Counsel: “The government could be looking at losing 11-0.”

Unlike in the US, where the politics of its supreme court justices are well known and, indeed, usually one of the reasons for their appointment, British justices maintain a far more neutral profile. Some of the 11, for example the deputy president, Lady Hale, and Lord Kerr, have a reputation for being staunch defenders of European human rights legislation. Others, such as Lord Sumption, have cautioned against the expansion of judicial power both in domestic and European courts.

But it’s not possible to draw a clear and definitive line between “liberals” and “conservatives”, let alone “friends” and “enemies” of the “people”. In any case, 11 justices is probably too large a number to fit on a Daily Mail front page. So if the government’s case is rejected, negative attention may focus on Neuberger.

It already has. Charles Moore, a former editor of the Daily Telegraph, has called on Neuberger (along with Hale) to recuse himself on the grounds that he is not impartial. Moore drew attention to pro-European tweets by Neuberger’s wife, Angela Holdsworth, in which she derided the referendum as “mad and bad” and retweeted a Remain campaign message: “It seems unlikely that a PM could trigger Article 50 without Parliament’s approval.”

The supreme court’s conduct guide reminds justices “to bear in mind that political activity by a close member of a justice’s family might raise concern in a particular case about the judge’s own impartiality”. Neuberger’s spokesman responded to suggestions that Holdsworth’s tweets raised exactly that concern by noting that the president doesn’t confuse political views with points of law.

A better contender for the flouting of guidelines, perhaps, was Hale’s intervention. She suggested during a lecture in Malaysia that if the government lost its appeal, it might need “a comprehensive replacement” for the 1972 act, a move that would push back the government’s March deadline for enacting article 50 by several months.

Neuberger appeared to reprimand his deputy when he told a reporter that in general, “judges shouldn’t discuss cases we’re about to hear”. However, he stood by her fitness to sit. “We have taken an oath to decide cases according to the law,” he explained, “and if we don’t do that we’re not worthy of the name of judges.”

Neuberger has held that name for 26 years. He comes from a family of scientists and rabbis. His father was professor of chemical pathology at St Mary’s hospital in Paddington, London, and his uncle was a well-known rabbi.

He has two brothers who are professors of, respectively, medicine and immunology and his other brother, a professor of finance, is married to Julia Neuberger, the crossbench peer and first British female rabbi to have her own synagogue.

Neuberger studied chemistry at Oxford, though he has said that he was “not very good at science”.

His choice, he has said, was to go into finance or law and he decided on finance because law involved too many exams. He joined the merchant bank NM Rothschild, only to realise that he was “even less good at finance than at science”.

And so in 1974, aged 26, after four attempts at pupillage, he was called to the bar. An expert in property law, he took silk in 1987, became a recorder three years later and a high court judge in 1996. His ascendancy through the senior judiciary was vertiginous, becoming a lord justice of appeal in 2004 and then, the day after his 59th birthday in 2007, a law lord.

Law lords tend to rival the Chinese politburo in the gerontocracy stakes, so still in his 50s, Neuberger was by some way the youngest. Two years later, he became master of the rolls, the second most senior judge in England and Wales.

He has known previous moments in the spotlight. He was wrongly said to have supported the right of witnesses and defendants to wear veils when giving evidence, but actually holds the opposite view. In 2004, when a court of appeal judge, Neuberger reached a minority decision – in opposition to his fellow judges – disallowing evidence obtained by torture in third countries where the UK was not complicit in gaining the evidence.

If that stance identified him as a liberal, other decisions might suggest otherwise; in 2010, for example, he ruled that peace protesters should be evicted from Parliament Square. To look back over Neuberger’s rulings, his decisions are not easily filed under distinct political labels. Although judges must be free to decide on the law as it stands, Neuberger believes, and knows, that they must always remain subordinate to the government. After all, if the government doesn’t like a legal ruling it can draw up new legislation and change the law.

That’s the defining difference between the US and British systems: in America, it’s prohibitively difficult to overturn a supreme court decision. The benefit of the lower stakes in Britain is that we can afford to appoint our supreme court justices for their legal expertise rather than their political loyalty.

It’s not Neuberger’s or any other supreme court or high court judge’s fault that the government decided to hold a referendum without clarifying the legal obligations of a Leave vote. Nor is it their fault that Miller decided to test the government’s legal position. That’s the nature of the law.

Given the legal merits of Miller’s case, and the government’s reliance on ancient and obscure prerogative powers, it would have taken a particularly slanted political position for the high court to have sided with the government. And the supreme court finds itself facing the same delicate situation.

Its judgment is not due until the new year. If, as expected, it backs the high court decision, Neuberger can look forward to a bucketload of opprobrium poured over his head on the front pages of several Brexit-supporting newspapers. But he can also look forward to retirement next year.

He’s already announced that he’s hanging up his wig in the summer – or he would be if he wore one. In the supreme court, justices’ wigs are deemed to be like political opinions: surplus to requirements.

Born David Edmond Neuberger, 10 January 1948, in London, to Albert and Lilian Neuberger. He went to Westminster School and Christ Church, Oxford. Married to Angela Holdsworth; three children.

Best of times His legal career has been one long upswing, so there are any number of highlights, but becoming the country’s youngest law lord may well stand out above the rest.

Worst of times Going by newspaper coverage, it could be next month (January), if the supreme court upholds the high court’s decision on Brexit.

What he says “A white, male, public-school judge presiding in a trial of an unemployed traveller from eastern Europe accused of assaulting or robbing a white, female, public-school woman will, I hope, always be unbiased. However, he should always think to himself what his subconscious may be thinking or how it may be causing him to act.”

What others say “After reading Lady Neuberger’s thoughts, one naturally wonders about Lord Neuberger’s. And that is exactly what ought not to happen when judges find themselves embroiled in a politically controversial case.” Charles Moore

Courts are ‘creaking’ as budget cuts and closures bite, according to some of those who work in them
###########################################################
His Royal Highness Emere Godwin Bebe Okpabi, the paramount ruler and hereditary king of the Ogale community in the oil-rich Niger delta, is ready to explode.

After nearly a week of sittting quietly in top hat and regal chains in the obscure technology and construction court in London listening to Shell, the Anglo-Dutch oil company, argue why 45,000 impoverished Ogalean farmers should not be allowed to sue the company in Britain for historical pollution, he says he feels “betrayed and saddened … I dispute everything they have said. To listen to Shell saying they have not been not responsible for the pollution in Ogale has been dreadful.”

King Emere wants to sue Shell in London for not cleaning up pollution because he fears his community may never get justice in Nigeria. “You can never, never defeat Shell in a Nigerian court. A case can go on for very many years. You can hardly get a judgment against [an oil company] in Nigeria. Shell is Nigeria and Nigeria is Shell.”

The stakes are high, he says. If the London judge hearing the preliminary arguments finds for the king then, in around one year’s time, Shell will have to defend itself in the British courts. The result could be a massive clean-up of Ogale, possibly millions of dollars’ in damages and other polluted communities bringing their cases to Britain.

The judge, who has nearly 1,000 pages of reports, submissions and statements from the two sides to consider will rule in the early new year. But if Shell wins, says the king, then the case will have to be heard in Nigeria where they may be able to avoid justice for decades because cases can get kicked between the appeal and supreme courts for many years.

“We are desperate people looking for justice. We know we cannot get justice there. A community near us got a huge judgment against Shell but the appeals have taken 10 years so far. In one case it has taken a community 32 years so far to get justice.”

Shell’s lawyers respond that the Nigerian justice system has been reformed and speeded up and that its Nigerian subsidiary, SPDC, should be held responsible for any pollution rather than the parent company, Shell International. They claim that Ogale has also been heavily affected by theft, pipeline sabotage and illegal refining rather than failure of infrastructure.

The king and and his legal team from a UK law firm, Leigh Day, argue that a precedent was set last year when Zambian villagers were allowed to take an Indian company to court in London over water pollution by a subsidiary because the Zambian legal system was deeply flawed.

That pollution has occurred in Ogale from old Shell and Nigerian oil company pipelines is not disputed. Official records say there have been more than 40 major spills in the small Ogale kingdom over the years, of which 23 have been since 2011.

In 2011 the UN environment programme (Unep) published a scientific study of pollution in Ogoniland which said it found oil spills happening with “alarming regularity” in Ogale, including groundwater contamination that is more than 4,500 times Nigerian recommended levels. Water samples taken in 2010 from three metres below ground were found to be contaminated with benzene and other chemicals.

King Emere offers a bottle of water taken recently, he says, from an Ogale borehole. The liquid smells powerfully of oil and tastes foul. “This is what we must drink. It is getting worse. We are getting strange illnesses. Our boys and girls cannot have children. We have strange deaths,” he says.

But the king says he is most saddened because he has witnessed the complete breakdown of trust between the company and his community. “I was a child of the 60s and 70s. We had a good relationship with the company. They would come with their Land Rovers. As little boys we would push them just to touch the Shell Land Rover. We used to go under the gas flare at the manifold to see the big beetles. We had no electricity. Our only lighting was the flare. We played there. When I was at primary school we used to run into the bush to get fruits, beautiful fruits. Now we have nothing.

“We did not know about pollution then. There were a lot of spills. We would see them and think nothing of them. We never knew that Shell was planting a time-bomb. We gradually realised things were getting bad in the 1980s and 1990s.

“Have we done well out of the partnership with Shell? No. They have dumped us. I got saddened as I sat in the court and watched them trying to create a distance between themselves and the consequences of pollution. I saw them trying to push the blame on to someone else.

“The truth is that Royal Dutch Shell has been responsible for the damage in my community. The same people we loved are killing us now.”

It’s the stuff of TV drama: schoolgirls befriend a German prisoner of war being held in Scotland during the second world war. After learning that he had never seen moving pictures, they smuggle him out of the camp for the day and take him to the cinema so he can watch a film for the first time.

That kindness is behind the reason Heinrich Steinmeyer decided to leave almost £400,000 in his will to the people of Comrie in Perthshire.



The former Waffen SS soldier was captured in France in 1944 when he was 19 and held at the PoW camp at Cultybraggan near Comrie. Classified as a category C prisoner – or hardline Nazi – Steinmeyer was detained there until June 1945 before being moved to another unit in Caithness and then a camp in Fife before eventually being released in 1948.

He returned to Comrie regularly after being freed and made life-long friendships in the area. The German died in 2014, aged 90, and his ashes were scattered in the hills above the camp.

Two years later, his wish to leave £384,000 to the village has been recognised and has been donated to the village’s local community trust to be spent on local development for the elderly. 



The Courier newspaper said part of Steinmeyer’s will reads: “I would like to express my gratitude to the people of Scotland for the kindness and generosity that I have experienced in Scotland during my imprisonment of war and hereafter.”

One of the friends he made was George Carson, who died just two weeks before the former soldier.

His son, also called George, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “It sounds like an unbelievable story but it’s absolutely true. My mother and her friends, all school children at Morrison’s academy in Crieff, made friends with Heinrich through the fence of the Cultybraggan camp.

“During these conversations they discovered that Heinrich had never seen a moving picture, so they went up with their push bikes one morning. One of the girls had taken her brother’s school uniform,” Carson said. “They smuggled him out of the camp through the chain-link fence and into the cinema where he saw his very first film. He was absolutely blown away by the whole experience.”

Carson said he met Steinmeyer a couple of times and described him as a “wonderful man … He had meetings with the Comrie Development Trust in 2008 and asked them to manage his estate on his death. He was quite specific in his will that the money should only be used on the elderly in the village,” Carson said. “This is his thanks for the kindness shown to him at the point of his life where he was at his lowest and he just wants to say thank you to everybody.”

The funds have now been transferred to a Heinrich Steinmeyer Legacy Fund and a consultation has begun to determine how best to spend his legacy.

Business gets off to a brisk start as the three magistrates take their seats on the bench in court three of Luton magistrates court.

Within an hour a 50-year-old local businessman, found slumped at the wheel of his stationary company vehicle in a layby, has been dispatched with £1,036 to pay in fine and costs and a six-month driving ban. An out-of-work drink-driver, arrested at 2am for driving with no lights, leaves with £235 to pay in fine and costs, and a 12-month disqualification. He can cut that to nine months by paying to attend a drink-drive referral scheme, at a cost of up to £250.

This is typical fare for the 17,000 justices of the peace in England and Wales, and both cases are dealt with swiftly by the bench, equipped with iPads and sentencing guidelines and aided by a qualified legal clerk, or legal adviser.



To the casual observer, there is no outward sign of an overburdened, creaking system, ground down by budget cuts and court closures, which, according to the Magistrates Association, is leading to disaffected magistrates resigning in “considerable’’ numbers.



During a day spent at Luton, however, the frustrations of court users emerge. For a start, this magistrates court now covers the whole of Bedfordshire, the old Bedford magistrates court having been mothballed. “Any defendant from Bedford or surrounding villages now needs to travel to Luton, which is a 20-mile journey, and relatively difficult to manage, especially if you are on benefits,” says Stephen Halloran, director at the law firm Lawtons.



Vinod Jumnoodoo, director at another local firm, JSP Law Ltd, suspects this has contributed to a rising number of “no-shows” – of which there were four in court three when the Guardian visited on Thursday. “A train leaving Bedford at 9.05am will get to Luton at 9.19am. That train ticket will cost £15.70. Imagine stumping up for that if you’re on benefits?” says Jumnoodoo. Add to that the costs in court time of arresting and processing the absconder.

It is not a local problem. Forty-seven magistrates courts closed their doors between March and September under government proposals to reduce the £500m annual cost of the courts estate, and a further 45 are due to shut by September 2017, meaning one-fifth of all courts in England and Wales will have disappeared in 19 months.



Whether high travel costs are a factor or not, there is a brief lull for the magistrates in court three one hour into their day. The usher is juggling her list to funnel through those pleading guilty in timely fashion, but someone is late, and others are waiting to see a duty solicitor.



Jo Cestaro and Dawn McKnight, from Lawton, are on the duty solicitors’ rota this day, as is James Bailey-Woodward from JSP Law. Legal aid cuts have meant more unrepresented defendants, which has meant more people seeing duty solicitors at the court on their first appearances.



Cestaro finds herself defending a 23-year-old man, who has pleaded guilty to driving while disqualified and without insurance. It is not his first such offence and he has racked up £5,000 in outstanding fines. He is unemployed, and it is a huge burden.



One sitting magistrate, unconnected to Luton, has told the Guardian how demoralising it is to see defendants accruing fine on top of fine, with no hope of paying. More should be done, he believes, to encourage people facing driving offences to deal with it out of court. “In court fines are larger than if a person just filled in the paperwork. It is usually the poor who don’t have insurance, and the less well educated who don’t understand how to fill in the forms.”



Cestaro’s disqualified driver seems a case in point. He has diagnosed depression, a terminally ill sister, family problems, a mountain of debt and no job. The magistrates call for a pre-sentencing probation report. “Do be frank and candid; it can only help you,” the chairman of the bench says as the defendant departs with a probation services officer for interview.



Thirty minutes later, the probation report is read aloud. Magistrates decide on an eight-week prison sentence, suspended for 12 months, and 15 “RAR” – rehabilitation activity requirement – days. He is banned from driving for 25 months, and while there is no additional fine, he still must pay £200 – £85 prosecution costs and £115 victim surcharge, which can only be consolidated with his current fines.



Once cases could be adjourned for three weeks for a pre-sentencing written probation report. Today, they can be completed almost instantly. It appears highly efficient. But there are fears that quality may suffer. “It is a very, very brief interview. The reports are becoming a tick-box pro forma, and are more scant than they used to be without a shadow of doubt,” says Jumnoodoo. Crown court cases take precedence, and magistrates quite often find probation reports not being prepared on time, says one JP, who does not sit at Luton.



Cuts mean the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) is also stretched, say lawyers, leading to papers not being available either to defence solicitors or magistrates on time. Often there is only a case summary, drawn up by police, which when actual statements arrive, after delay, “bears no resemblance to reality”, says Jumnoodoo.



Prosecutors are travelling further and being parachuted into courts they weren’t expecting to deal with, he adds: “Downtrodden prosecutors now are not too shy to simply state to the court: ‘I can’t deal with that file/ I haven’t read it.’”



There is a sense that continuing cuts can lead to a dislocation nationwide between such courts and the communities they serve, with defendants, prosecutors and magistrates all travelling further, to courts rarely covered by their local newspapers.



Back in court three, business goes on without too many apparent problems. Warrants for the arrests for the “no-shows” are issued. A 29-year-old unemployed man, accused of biting a police officer in the thigh while under arrest for brandishing his belt as a weapon outside McDonald’s and refusing a blood specimen test, receives an 18-week sentence suspended for 12 months, a driving ban and fines and compensation totalling £570. The 18-year-old he got into an altercation with, and who also brandished his belt, receives a 12-month community order, 150 hours’ community service, and £170 in costs. Both get a 7pm-7am curfew.



But Bailey-Woodward from JSP Law, who is representing a woman accused of shoplifting, is forced to wait several hours for her papers to arrive, only to discover she is not, as assumed, pleading guilty, but entering a not guilty plea. A trial date is set for February.



The aim, drummed into magistrates during their training, is not to clog the system. They are trained to adjourn only “in extraordinary circumstances”, says one Luton magistrate who has spent 26 years on the bench, and who does not wish to be named. “Some days you work solidly. Others, you wonder why you bothered to come. The number of times something or someone is missing, or people have sent the papers over too late, or not at all.” But he has great sympathy with the CPS staff, “who are under a lot of pressure”.



One way courts can relieve that pressure is by “undercharging”, it is claimed. “Instead of GBH, you will get charged with an ABH. Instead of ABH you will get charged with an assault. Just to encourage people to plead to a lesser offence,” says Halloran.



Overall, the number of people being processed and charged has “drastically dropped”, and volumes are down significantly, he adds, “and it cannot all be down to the work of the youth offending team. The reality is that the police/CPS, unless they have overwhelming evidence, won’t charge an offence or they will try to divert it, just to save money.”



The system is “creaking” he says, and relies on the goodwill of those involved to keep the show on the road.



Goodwill is there. It’s there in the form of the 33-year-old mother of two young children, now in her last days of training to become a magistrate at Luton. Juggling being a magistrate with her job and motherhood is not going to be easy. “The system is not set up for people who are younger and have these other commitments,” she says. However, she is determined.



And despite his 26 years on the bench, the longstanding Luton JP remains committed. As an ex-headmaster, he laments the reduction in the number of youth courts at Luton, from two a week to just half a day a week. Here he felt he could make a real difference. Now the less serious youth offences never reach court, and the really serious cases are sent up to crown courts, which have greater sentencing powers, he says.



But, he adds: “I’m still doing it. It is still worth doing. It is still working, but it is creaking”.

The number of unpaid magistrates in England and Wales has declined steeply from 30,000 in 2006 to 17,500 today.

Court closures, falling crime rates and a relative increase in the number of full-time district judges have all been blamed for the fall.

But the main reason magistrates – also known as justices of the peace (JPs) – cite for resigning is the long distances they are forced to travel to court, which has broken the link between benches and their local communities.

About 250 magistrates courts, youth courts and county courts have closed since 2010 as part of a coordinated cost-cutting drive. The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) argues that 95% of defendants should be able to reach their local court within an hour by car. Keeping to the speed limit, that implies many will be up to 70 miles away.

Approximately 53% of magistrates are women and 89% are white. Many benches have no or few members from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds. More than 86% are over the age of 50.

Their sense of being undervalued has been sharpened by the belief that professional district judges are given the more interesting and complex cases.



Malcolm Richardson, the national chairman of the Magistrates Association, told the Guardian: “A number of resigning magistrates cite issues such as court closures and overall dissatisfaction caused by the lack of respect with which they are treated by the system as core reasons for leaving. Some considerable talent and thousands of years’ experience are lost as a result.

“Government needs to come up with a strategy for the magistracy and then start recruiting and use that opportunity to broaden the range of people sitting as magistrates. Contrary to popular belief, the magistracy is actually quite reflective of the demographics of England and Wales in ethnicity terms, but not age.”

The Magistrates Association is encouraging more working-age people to join the bench in order to lower the average age of JPs.

It has also argued for magistrates to be given greater sentencing powers, a request endorsed by the Commons’ justice select committee in the autumn which warned there was a need to tackle low morale in the service. 



The government has so far resisted extending the magistracy’s sentencing powers from a maximum of six months to 12 months for a single offence. Authority for it to do so already exists under section 154 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 but this has never been brought into force. 



Ministers and some civil rights groups fear it would lead to more offenders being sent to already overcrowded prisons.

The Conservative MP Bob Neill, who chairs the justice select committee, said in October: “It is unfortunate that the government’s evident goodwill towards the magistracy has not yet been translated into any meaningful strategy for supporting and developing it within a changing criminal justice system. This needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency.

“Although evidence does not indicate a universal problem, there is sufficient evidence of low morale within the magistracy to cause concern.”

Penelope Gibbs, a former magistrate and director of the campaign group Transform Justice, said at the time: “Magistrates themselves have lighted on increased sentencing powers … as the answer to their problems. It would give magistrates courts more work, but it risks increasing prison numbers and decreasing the number of trials heard by juries. The government and the senior judiciary need to halt the downward drift in magistrate numbers and devise a strategy to save the magistracy, not enact one measure which may have perverse effects.”

An MoJ spokesperson said: “The magistracy remains at the heart of our justice system, and we will consider the case for increasing their sentencing powers.

“Closing underused and dilapidated court buildings will allow us to reinvest in the justice system and make the best use of technology.

“This will improve access to justice and improve the experience for all court users, in particular vulnerable victims and witnesses.”

Company investigated over allegations of bribery maintains anti-corruption agency misused its legal powers

The Rev Mike and the Rev Nicky-Sue Terry have the classic married couple’s habit of finishing each other’s sentences. But perhaps it’s unsurprising that they know each other’s minds so well. They are not just man and wife, but also two halves of a pioneering job-share within the Church of England, splitting the role of vicar for St Mary’s in the Hampshire village of Warsash between them.

They take turns conducting services, he chairs parish council meetings, she runs the pastoral team, and vicarage life is divided according to individual strengths, although both try to take Fridays off. Mike, who previously served in the Royal Navy, likes long-term planning; Nicky-Sue says she prefers “to get into the detail of things, which … ” – she pauses, and Mike interjects – “drives me completely barmy”. Some parishioners in distress are drawn to her, some to him, but they try to make the relationship seamless. “We have a phrase we use,” says Mike, “which is: ‘We are the vicar, we are.’”

And both are thrilled to have a way of working that suits them. Having entered the church late in life – Mike, now 60, met 54-year-old Nicky-Sue in 2007, when both were training for ordination – neither wanted to run a church full-time, and so when their bishop suggested an experimental job share, both were intrigued. “In a sense, this is the Church of England beginning to recognise that we can do things in a more flexible way, and can be responsive to a modern environment,” Mike adds. “It’s a very positive reflection on a changing world. And if the Church of England can do it, that says something.”

Thirteen years after Tony Blair’s government pushed through the legal right to request flexible working amid squeals of protest, it feels as if the last bastions of traditional working practices are finally being stormed. Change is lapping at the highest reaches of the establishment; the armed forces, parliament and the judiciary.

Next spring, a landmark report is due to be published exploring the feasibility of job-sharing for MPs, to encourage parents and disabled candidates into parliament. The Ministry of Defence is in the middle of a trial project, offering soldiers with young children the chance to defer deployment overseas or rejig chunks of leave to reduce their hours. The scheme will be opened to more service personnel from February.

Two unnamed judges recently began the high court’s first ever job-share, and last week it emerged that future vacancies on the supreme court will be open to flexible applications in the hope of attracting female judges. (Currently the ratio is one woman to 11 men.)

The next big leap in the story, says the Fawcett Society’s chief executive Sam Smethers, would be moving to a default assumption that every job can be made flexible in some way – early starts or finishes, home working, part-time work or job-sharing – unless there is good reason not to. But that means showing it can work even at the top, and in professions once stoutly resistant to change.

“It’s about opening minds and realising that a lot of the way we do things is just because we’ve always done it that way,” she adds, “not because that’s the way it has to be done. In most jobs there is some prospect of flexible working.”

The niggling question, however, is how firmly these painstaking gains for working parents are entrenched in workplace culture: there are fears that, in a potentially tougher economic climate post-Brexit, it might become too easy to roll back employment rights. This is why it is so intriguing that even professions granted exemption from the law are now voluntarily thinking the previously unthinkable.

The single biggest reason for leaving the armed forces, according to the annual Armed Forces Continuous Attitude Survey, is the impact on family life – and it’s not just affecting women. There is growing concern about promising male officers leaving in their 30s and early 40s, just as experience becomes invaluable, because of the toll taken on marriages and children. It is this prospect of troops voting with their feet that has prompted a rethink of the rigid patterns of army life.

If the role of military wives was once to stay at home raising children while their men were off at war, those days are long gone. Almost one in 10 soldiers is now female, many military spouses work, and too many struggle to fit that around their soldier’s long absences and unpredictable hours. In a recent survey for the Army Families Federation (AFF), which has campaigned for flexible working on forces families’ behalves, 39% of spouses said their partner couldn’t help with childcare even occasionally. (For soldiers not on active deployment, variable start times and other forms of flexibility may be be available, but the forces are exempt from the legal right to request).

“You can’t rely on your soldier to finish at fixed times. They’re away a lot and the burden of the childcare absolutely falls on the spouses,” explains Louise Simpson, policy and research director at the AFF, and an army wife herself.

“If you talk to an organisation like Recruit for Spouses, which helps military spouses return to work, they’re trying to place people who were in incredible jobs [before becoming] military spouses, who are now downsizing considerably and finding even that difficult. Employers look at their CVs and say: ‘Oh, we can’t have someone this highly qualified.’” Yet many spouses can’t afford, she says, not to work.

Simpson praises the army’s current chief of general staff, General Sir Nick Carter, who personally backed the flexible working experiment last year by declaring there was “absolutely no reason” for not changing parade times on a base so that soldiers could do the school run. Tiny changes could, Simpson says, make a big difference.

But the Ministry of Defence remains cautious about the impact on operational readiness to deploy. The trial will continue until at least 2019 before any final decision is taken.

Meanwhile, the AFF argues that more could be done to spread the message that modern couples both work and need to share the domestic load. “We need to educate our command that this is the way most people operate now, so if every now and then a soldier wants to leave at 4pm to pick up the kids, they could,” says Simpson. But there is some private anxiety about the consequences of taking up the offer: one new mother Simpson talked to recently said her soldier husband wouldn’t take up the scheme because he worried that “it would be an end to the fast track”. For both civilian and military parents, the key may be making sure that flexibility goes right to the top of the tree.

At first glance, judges make terrible candidates for part-time working, since the same judge must sit continuously through trials that can last weeks. But the crown court now has a handful of part-timers, working in blocks of several weeks on and several weeks off – and the supreme court’s cases are shorter and more predictable than criminal trials, which makes them potentially more amenable to part-timers if they were carefully matched to cases. A final decision has yet to be taken on what kind of hours will be accepted, but crucially, candidates won’t have to declare that they want to work flexibly unless they are short-listed, meaning their CVs should be sifted purely on merit.

Since most supreme court justices are in their late 50s and 60s, the changes are unlikely to attract new mothers, but could suit someone seeking reduced hours because they are caring for an elderly parent, or to see teenagers through A-levels. And more than that, it sends a powerful signal through the system. “What we’re saying is that, actually, we appreciate people are looking to us to take the lead,” said a spokesman for the supreme court.

What kind of boss denies women the legal right to maternity leave, requires them to commute hundreds of miles a week and calls them lazy if they complain? The answer, technically, is all of us. MPs are not legally employees, but servants of the people, and the people can be unforgiving bosses. Ironically, the law on working life is currently made by people whose working conditions would be illegal almost anywhere else.

The Labour MP Rachel Reeves has just written a biography of the pioneering Labour minister Alice Bacon, Alice in Westminster, in which she reflects on how life has changed for female politicians since Alice’s election in 1945. “The hours have massively changed, the through-the-night sittings that existed in her day – the latest I’ve been there is maybe 1.30am,” says Reeves, who has two children under three years old. “There’s a nursery now, whereas when Alice was an MP very few women had children. There was a feeling you couldn’t have both. Those are choices that women are much less willing to make now.”

But the flipside of afternoon and evening sittings was that some MPs in Alice’s day treated parliament as a part-time job, pursuing careers in law or the City during the day. Time could be interestingly elastic, if what you wanted was the freedom to make money, not the freedom to see your children.

And while back then established MPs might have deigned to visit their constituency only once a year, the weekly shuttle back and forth is the bane of many modern political parents’ lives. Since there’s no way around the need to live in two places at once without breaking the constituency link, there is growing interest in job-sharing, with two candidates standing for parliament on one ticket and dividing the work between them.

Two Green activists, Sarah Cope and Clare Phipps, brought an unsuccessful court case last year arguing they should be allowed to stand for parliament as a job-share, and this week the Green MP Caroline Lucas – who shares her own party’s leadership with Jonathan Bartley – once again backed the idea.

But it remains controversial, dividing even those passionate about opening up parliament. Reeves thinks ministerial posts could be shared relatively easily, but worries about how an MP job-share would cope if its two halves disagreed over an unexpected issue, such as the vote on bombing Syria: “For me, that was an incredibly difficult decision. I had friends who politically I’m very close to who voted the other way. I’m not sure how you agree that in advance. Do you just say: ‘Well, it’s a Wednesday, so that’s Rachel’s day to vote?’ That doesn’t feel right. I personally think it’s incredibly difficult.”

Nonetheless, two academics, Bristol University’s Prof Sarah Childs – author of a separate recent report on diversifying the Commons, currently being studied by a working group of MPs – and Birkbeck University’s Dr Rosie Campbell, are examining the practical challenges for a report due next spring.

The urgent priority for many in Westminster, however, remains dragging arrangements for new parents into the 21st century. Ministers have been able to take maternity leave since 2001, but new mothers still have no formal right to time off constituency work. Most muddle through, reliant on the goodwill of whips to excuse them from voting at Westminster, while braced for criticism over their temporarily patchy presence. Reeves recalls signing casework shortly after her second child was born last June, and resuming constituency surgeries within six weeks. Despite being signed off Westminster votes for four months, she turned up to vote on Syria and tax credit cuts. “I was never completely off,” she says, before adding hastily, “but I’m sure that’s true for people in other jobs as well.”

Why don’t MPs complain more about conditions most parents wouldn’t tolerate? Reeves snorts incredulously at the question: “Because you get no sympathy!” Besides, she says, there’s flexibility in the school holidays when MPs work from their constituencies. “I don’t think we have loads to complain about. We’re a bit like self-employed people, who can’t take maternity leave because it’s going to cost you.”

The snail’s pace of reform in parliament undoubtedly reflects private fears of a backlash from voters still smarting over the expenses scandal. But Childs remains optimistic about the prospects for change, arguing that it is in nobody’s interest if MPs “have to rely on good relations with the whips” to get time off to recover from childbirth.

She is struck, too, by the way the wave of SNP MPs elected in 2015 are starting to change the dynamic. Used to the more modern Scottish parliament, which keeps something closer to office hours, she says they are much more willing to question stuffier traditions: “They’re able to make comparisons, and they look around and say: ‘Why are we doing this the way we do?’”

And as the two vicars of St Mary’s found out, that can be a life-changing question. “When we started, it was an experiment; we had no sense that we would do what we do now,” says Nicky-Sue, who thinks a job share might never have occurred to them without their bishop’s prompting. “But there’s something very symbolic about it, a married couple sharing a post like this. It’s perhaps a challenging concept. But it’s a beautiful one.”

The Dorchester’s leaked list of grooming rules for female staff could open up the luxury hotel to lawsuits filed by current and former employees, critics have said.

A set of grooming demands was this week reported to have been emailed by hotel managers to employees after the five-star establishment received complaints about the general hygiene of its staff.

According to the leak, women were asked not to turn up for work with oily skin, bad breath or garish makeup. They were also encouraged to shave their legs, ensure their fingernails were manicured and avoid body odour.

Kiran Daurka, an employment lawyer at Leigh Day, said dress codes were lawful when they related directly to the requirements of a job, but could be challenged when they encouraged the objectification of staff.

“I would have concerns where a policy seemingly objectifies women by asking them to look a certain way which has no bearing on their ability to do a job,” she told the Guardian. “For example, hair removal is clearly about objectification and sexualisation, as there is some ideal of what a woman should look like.

“This may also unlawfully offend the religious or other beliefs of women whose belief system does not allow the removal of hair.

“A dress code that treats women less favourably than men is discriminatory. But even where a policy is applied to all, it may still particularly disadvantage women, and that disadvantage would need to be objectively justified.”

An unnamed employee told the Daily Mail: “It’s disgusting. This list is like something out of the dark ages and downright offensive. It’s not as though you choose to have oily skin, and a lot of women, especially teenagers, cannot help it – no facial wash or moisturiser in the world can control that.

“The women are all pretty livid but worry that if they complain – or rebel and turn up to work with chipped, dirty nails and hairy legs, for example – they’ll be sacked on the spot.”

Philip Landau, an employment lawyer from Landau Law, said there were many reasons why an employer may want to have a dress code or appearance policy, such as to communicate a professional and corporate image. However, “an employer’s policy must not be discriminatory in respect of the protected characteristics in the 2010 Equality Act for age, disability, gender reassignment, religion or belief, sex, or sexual orientation”, he said.

“Accordingly, any dress code or appearance policy should apply to both men and women equally. The codes do not have to be identical, as there will clearly be different requirements for male staff, but it does have to amount to similar standards. It is not clear what the equivalent grooming policy is for male staff at the Dorchester.

“A grooming policy should also be reasonable and proportionate in nature, with particular reference to the work that is being carried out. If it isn’t, and you are dismissed for failing to comply with the code, you may have a claim for direct discrimination on the grounds of sex if there has been a detriment for one gender over the other. You may also have a claim for unfair dismissal.”

Landau said employers needed to “tread carefully” in case they were seen to indirectly discriminate against an employee. The requirement not to display any excess body hair, including on the face, could discriminate against those with conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), of which one of the main symptoms is excess androgen – high levels of “male hormones” in the body.

“This may cause physical signs, such as excess facial or body hair, and therefore a blanket policy of no facial hair could amount to indirect discrimination on the grounds of disability and sex,” he said.



Ewa Jasiewicz, a union organiser for hotel workers in London, said she believed the stipulations left workers open to discrimination, especially if they were transgender or gender fluid. “Gender is a protected characteristic under the Equality Act and this includes gender presentation and reassignment,” Jasiewicz said.

“Women workers at the Dorchester do not enjoy transparency on where their service charge goes and do not have fair tips or [a] living wage, but are expected to spend money on manicures? This beggars belief. This in my opinion is a form of paternalistic, sexist, gendered taxation on an already exploited and underpaid female workforce.”

The Unite regional officer Dave Turnbull said: “People of different ethnic backgrounds may not be able to comply with the requirements due to their skin or hair type.

“It is possible that there is an underlying race issue here, as we are often told by members that hotels do try to avoid having black people in front-of-house position and it could easily be interpreted that the Dorchester are trying to get female staff to conform to a certain type.

“Also there are religions where the removal of facial hair may not be acceptable. There may be disability issues linked to this as well, for example skin conditions or allergies to certain types of makeup.”



To apply these standards only to female staff would be clearly sexist, he said. “It treats women workers as if they are part of the product that is being sold by the hotel and can place staff at risk of sexual harassment and comments from customers who might view them as a commodity.”

Workers in the Dorchester and other hotels were on low basic pay and often reliant on variable elements, such as tips or service charges, to top up their earnings, Turnbull said. “The cost of makeup, beauty treatments and compliance with dress code requirements can be extremely expensive and is never factored in by an additional allowance of any sort. Again, this could easily place employers at risk of claims of sex discrimination, as male employees are not expected to shoulder the same expenses.”

An employee at another London hotel, who asked to remain anonymous, said she was subjected to similar rules. She told the Guardian her main issue was that female employees had to wear tight dresses, which was “unfair and impractical” for her waitressing job. It also opened her up to unwanted comments from colleagues and guests. “If I’m cleaning a table, male workers will say things like: ‘Oh, stay right there,’” she said.



While the rules do not stipulate that the waitress must remove any facial hair, the 24-year-old, employed by a boutique hotel frequented by wealthy clients, said she had to wear skin-coloured tights rather than black ones, which meant having to shave her legs regularly, and that there was an expectation to look attractive. “We’re told that we have to dress as if we’re on our first date,” she said.



Sam Smethers, the chief executive of the Fawcett Society, said it was completely unacceptable for any woman to be told what she should wear and how she should look. “Employers should concentrate on what enables people to do a good job and what drives productivity. This is 2016, not 1970; we need to see an end to this kind of objectification of women,” she said.

The Dorchester said the rules were not emailed to all staff, but were provided to job applicants. The hotel’s general manager, Roland Fasel, said: “The Dorchester has a proud community of employees who uphold world-leading hospitality standards, including grooming, in line with many other brands.

“All new applicants, both men and women, are sent a copy of our grooming standards in advance of interview.”

Immigrants detained for months and even years by the federal government should have no right to a bond hearing to determine whether their detention is necessary or justified. That might seem like an extreme statement. It is. But it’s not coming from Donald Trump. That’s what lawyers for the Obama administration this week argued before the US supreme court in Jennings v Rodriguez.

Non-citizens, including lawful permanent residents, are often locked up for lengthy periods in prison-like conditions while fighting deportation proceedings. That’s a result of a 1996 law, signed by President Bill Clinton, which made detention mandatory for a huge swath of immigrants convicted of crimes – even minor ones and even cases where an immigrant poses no public safety or flight risk.

It’s a remarkable case that encapsulates the absurd brutality of contemporary immigration politics: so-called moderates like Clinton, George Bush and Barack Obama have built and defended a monstrously efficient deportation machine that will soon be handed over to a hardcore nativist.

As of October, a record 40,000-plus immigrants, including many asylum seekers, were detained by the federal government, mostly in private facilities. That number that could grow much larger under Trump. The president-elect has pledged to orchestrate mass deportations and also promised to freeze federal hiring, which could make an already severely backlogged immigration court system grind to nearly a halt. It’s no surprise that private prison company stocks soared after Trump’s win.

“If the president-elect means what he says on detention and means what he says on the hiring freeze, inevitably detention times are going to skyrocket,” said Michael Tan, a staff attorney with the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project and one of the attorneys on the case.

The Obama administration’s response is that immigrants can file habeas corpus petitions in federal court – a complicated and time-consuming process that would provide no due process for most immigrants subject to imprisonment by the federal government.



The case before the supreme court is a class-action lawsuit represented by Alejandro Rodriguez, a lawful permanent resident brought to the United States as an infant whom the government sought to deport because of convictions for drug possession and “joyriding”. Rodriguez was imprisoned for more than three years with no bond hearing while he fought deportation – a fight he ultimately won.

In fact, it is the very people detained for lengthy periods like Rodriguez who are most likely to win their cases and be allowed to remain in the US because they have substantive claims to make. Those without such claims are typically subject to rapid deportation.

“The sad irony is the people who have the strongest claim to lawful status in the United States are the most likely to end up in detention for months or years without ever being able to see a judge and seek relief,” said Tan.

Those detained for six months or longer, according to the ACLU, are five times more likely to win their case than the average immigration detainee.

Though Trump has made brazen racism and xenophobia the centerpiece of his political persona, his policy agenda echoes that pursued by Obama: deporting those convicted of crimes. But the majority of those detained by immigration authorities for six months or longer, according to the ACLU, were convicted of crimes so minor that they carried a conviction of no longer than six months.

The US court of appeals for the ninth circuit found that non-citizens like Rodriguez did have a right to a bond hearing every six months. The Obama administration disagreed and appealed to the supreme court.

In the 2003 case Demore v Kim, the supreme court ruled in favor of the government’s power to detain non-citizens for a limited amount of time without a bond hearing – a period that the court found, based on information provided by the government, averaged roughly five months for those fighting their deportation before the Board of Immigration Appeals. The problem, the government conceded in an August letter to the court, is that that figure is bogus. In reality, the average detention time for such non-citizens was more than a year.

The government, according to Scotusblog’s bloodless analysis, is in part relying on the 1953 case Shaughnessy v United States ex rel Mezei, which “denied judicial review to an immigrant held in indefinite detention based on secret evidence, an outcome next to impossible to square with modern constitutional law.”

Trump has made it clear that he has little respect for constitutional rights. Obama’s dismal record will make it all the easier for the president-elect to shred them.

What does a perpetrator of violence against women look like? For many, the question still evokes images of shadowy strangers pouncing in the dark or thuggish drunken husbands stumbling home from football matches – stereotypes challenged tirelessly by women’s organisations and campaigners, especially throughout the current 16 days of action against gender-based violence.

In reality, women are statistically most likely to be assaulted by someone known to them, and domestic abuse can be, and is, also perpetrated by handsome middle-class professionals. Busting myths is therefore a crucial tool in the fight against a culture which relies on them. But for all these vital and urgent conversations about the true face of perpetrators, there is one that remains largely invisible in spite of both ubiquity and power: the state itself.

Violence does not exist solely in the instant that blow meets body, but in the circumstances that facilitate it and the systems which excuse it. One needs only glance at violent crime statistics since 2009 to spot a sharp increase in violence affecting women, correlating neatly with the introduction of austerity measures in the same year which have since seen 34 women’s refuges close and 95% of women’s organisations facing a funding crisis. The subsequent diversion of the tampon tax into women’s charities, while widely hailed as a feminist victory, in fact achieved little more than imposing the financial burden of their own health and support services on to women, while men continue to enjoy state-funded “mainstream” care.

Changes to the welfare system, too, illustrate at best a naivety around violence against women and at worst a complicity; for all the widely acknowledged flaws of universal credit, for example, little has been made of the stipulation to pay it only to one “head of household”, limiting the financial autonomy of women and gifting abusive partners ammunition by which to keep their victims hostage.

If economic policy too accurately embodies its violent language of slashing and cutting, legislation around crime and justice delivers an almost laughable irony. In some cases, the very laws purportedly designed to protect women from violence can, in practice, enable it: the criminalisation of various activities relating to the sale of sex, for example, is universally opposed by sex worker-organising collectives, on the grounds that it limits their ability to work safely – for instance, in groups or designated zones – and without fear of violence from both clients and state agencies.

When women do experience violence at the hands of a male perpetrator, as 1 in 4 UK women will in their lifetimes, a tangle of state systems and institutions make the path to justice anything but easy, despite the criminalisation of such violence in law. Cuts to legal aid, for instance, disproportionately affect women bringing claims of sexual violence and domestic abuse, and that’s if they haven’t already been put off by the degrading and painful experiences that women before them have legally faced in the UK justice system, or the country’s unrealistically low prosecution rate for gender-based violence.

Women’s experience of such state-sanctioned violence does, of course, differ based on individual identities, and predictably those also marginalised elsewhere are both hardest hit and affected in unique ways: a lack of affordable housing trapping women in poverty in abusive relationships; black women living in fear of police brutality; trans women routinely placed into male prisons with little regard for their increased vulnerability to sexual violence and suicide there.

In particular, refugee and migrant women remain especially at risk of state violence, in large part through their interactions with detention centres like Yarl’s Wood, where a protest tomorrow aims to oppose the inhumane treatment of detainees including the prevalence of sexual violence against women held in the facility. These are the findings that Theresa May, then home secretary, last year refused to disclose details of for fear of “prejudicing commercial interests” – a stark assertion of exactly where this government’s priorities lie when it comes to the safety of vulnerable women.

Taken as a whole, then, the picture in the UK is one where women still face epidemic levels of violence, but lack the support of a state which at best enables and at worst perpetrates it. It’s time to move beyond an understanding of violence against women as a personal issue between individuals, and see it as a strategy built into our institutions and society in order to maintain a status quo where women – particularly the most marginalised – are subordinated.

Politicians are good at talking the talk: “No woman should live in fear of violence and every girl should grow up knowing she is safe,” reads May’s foreword in the government’s Ending Violence Against Women and Girls strategy. But until her own actions and that of her government say otherwise, this noble vision remains far from realised.

Company investigated over allegations of bribery maintains anti-corruption agency misused its legal powers

Scotland’s minimum age of criminal responsibility will be raised to 12 years, in line with UN standards, after the current minimum age of eight, the lowest in Europe, was labelled a “national embarrassment”.

Mark McDonald, minister for childcare and early years, announced on Thursday afternoon that the Scottish government would bring forward legislation to raise the age by four years, calling the case for it “clear and compelling”.



In a statement to Holyrood, McDonald told MSPs: “Having the lowest minimum age of criminal responsibility in Europe does not match with our progressive approach to youth justice and ambitions to give children the best start in life.”



A recent consultation with police, prosecutors and victims’ groups found that 95% supported an increase to the age of 12 or above.

In 2010, the Scottish government raised the age of criminal prosecution to 12, assuring that no one under that age could be prosecuted or sentenced in the criminal courts but would be dealt with through children’s hearings. However, those outcomes would still be added to children’s criminal records.

McDonald said: “Raising the age of criminal responsibility will mean people no longer face potentially damaging and life-altering consequences, such as a criminal record, for events that took place when they were a young child.”

He added that he recognised the need for safeguards in exceptional cases, and that police would still have powers to investigate serious offences committed by children under 12s.

The minimum age of criminal responsibility in England and Wales is 10. The UN committee on the rights of the child has stated that setting the age of criminal responsibility below 12 is considered “not to be internationally acceptable”.

Liam McArthur MSP, the Scottish Liberal Democrat justice spokesperson, welcomed the decision. His predecessor in the role Alison McInnes advocated the rise, but her attempts to alter the law by bringing forward amendments to a criminal justice bill in the last Holyrood session were voted down by the SNP.

McDonald told the chamber on Thursday that he wanted to put on the record his thanks to McInnes for pressing the issue. McArthur likewise praised her “tireless work”, adding: “Eight-year-olds should be treated as children not criminals. The fact they can receive convictions which need to be declared for decades, or even the rest of their lives, is a national embarrassment.”

The acting chair of the Scottish youth parliament, Amy Lee Fraioli MSYP, also welcomed the move, adding that children and young people across Scotland felt strongly about the issue. “Raising the age of criminal responsibility from eight to 12 is an important step towards fully incorporating the UN convention on the rights of the child into Scots law. Many children who find themselves in children’s hearings are also victims themselves, and are often ill-equipped to deal with the situations they find themselves in. Raising the age will help ensure that Scotland is a fair place for children, and shift focus to supporting children instead of criminalising them.”

The government has been warned that up to 1 million EU citizens living in the UK could be at risk of deportation if it does not come up with a simple way of recognising their status in the country.

The 3 Million, a grassroots group lobbying for the rights of non-British citizens who have made the UK their home, has told the home secretary it would take the Home Office 47 years to process applications from EU citizens for permanent residency (PR). “We are people with families, children, friends and work colleagues, and we are rightly worried about a very uncertain future,” said Nicolas Hatton, chair of the 3 Million, in his letter to Amber Rudd.

“EU citizens have been feeling very anxious about their future since the referendum, and this set of data will not reassure them. We call on you to remove the threat of deportation without notice and give us, today, guarantees that all EU citizens living legally in the UK will be able to exercise their right to remain before the UK leaves the EU.”

Theresa May has consistently said that rights for EU citizens were a legitimate part of Brexit negotiations, but on Thursday night the government seemed to go one step further by indicating their rights could be removed if not reciprocated.

A Home Office spokesperson said: “The home secretary has been clear that she wants to protect the status of EU nationals already living here, and the only circumstances in which that wouldn’t be possible is if British citizens’ rights in European member states were not protected in return.”

The estimated time it would take the Home Office to deal with the 3 million EU citizens in the country is based on the latest immigration data, which shows a surge in applications for PR since the EU referendum, which has caused a backlog of 100,000 applications.



PR was designed for non-EU citizens who wished to settle in the UK and involves an 85-page application form. Applicants not only have to provide five years of council tax bills, bank statements or utility bills to demonstrate residency, but also have to document each time they have been in and out of the country since they arrived in the UK. 



Monika Lutke-Daldrup from Germany, who is an executive with a large European firm and lives in Watford, told the Guardian: “I travel about 20 times a year and I have been here for 18 years. It is ridiculous.”

Paola Rizatto said: “I am an educated person, but I found the 85-page form so overwhelming that I decided to hire an immigration lawyer. I have already spent around £1,000.”

Several mothers who have British children say they are not eligible for PR because their household bills are not in their names. “Just to be married to a British person or to have British children is not enough,” said one. Another, who asked not to be named, said she had been told to get her child’s school to sign a statement that she had been picking up her child each day for the past five years.



The 3 Million said the Home Office process for PR “is totally inconsistent and depends on what Home Office adviser you get”.

Data published on Thursday shows that 30% of applications are rejected, with many EU citizens unable to pass the paperwork test despite their legal right of residence as EU citizens.

If the government requires all non-Britons to join the non-EU immigrants in the permanent residency queue, up to 1 million could face deportation the day the UK leaves the EU. 



The Home Office said there had been “no change to the rights and status of EU nationals in the UK as a result of the referendum”. Its guidance was that EU citizens did not need to apply for permanent residence. “As such there is no requirement to register for documentation to confirm their status,” a spokesperson said.

A company that is implicated in an international bribery scandal has launched legal action against the Serious Fraud Office, alleging that the anti-corruption agency has unlawfully misused its powers.

The SFO is investigating Unaoil, a Monaco-based oil and gas firm, over allegations that it paid bribes to win contracts in several countries for dozens of multinationals, including the British engineering firm Rolls-Royce. According to the SFO, the alleged corruption is “very extensive”.

On Thursday, Unaoil opened its legal challenge in the high court in London, claiming that investigators working for the SFO unlawfully raided its headquarters in Monaco and seized a large cache of its documents, phones and computer equipment in a “cavalier” fashion. The firm alleges that the raid amounted to an “excessively wide fishing expedition rather than a proper exercise of” its legal powers.

Unaoil has denied all wrongdoing. In its submission to Lord Justice Gross and Mr Justice Nicol, Unaoil described how the SFO asked the police in Monaco to raid its HQ in March and used a truck to transport the seized material to the UK.

The raid was initiated after the SFO started investigating corruption allegations involving Unaoil, Rolls-Royce and an Australian multinational, according to Unaoil’s submission. The allegations related to transactions in Iraq dating back to 2005, the submission said.

Hugo Keith, a QC acting for Unaoil, alleged that the SFO’s request to the Monaco police to carry out the raid “lacked candour” and had misled them over the seriousness and urgency of the reasons for the raid.

Ata Ahsani, chairman of Unaoil, and his two sons, Cyrus and Saman, are seeking a court order quashing the legality of the raid, compelling the SFO to return the seized material and destroy any copies it holds.

A day after the raid in March, reporters at Australia’s Fairfax Media alleged – based on a leak of thousands of Unaoil’s documents – that the firm had systematically corrupted the global oil industry, distributing millions of dollars of bribes on behalf of Rolls-Royce and other multinationals which were seeking to secure contracts.

Rolls-Royce said it was fully co-operating with investigations into the allegations and could not comment in detail.

The SFO is opposing Unaoil’s legal challenge, maintaining that its actions were legal. In its defence, the SFO said it had “significant grounds to suspect” that Unaoil had “paid bribes and/or conspired together to pay bribes to high-ranking Iraqi and other public officials on behalf of” its clients.

The agency, which said its investigation was not limited to alleged bribery to Iraqi officials, added that Unaoil was “under investigation for the payment of a series of large bribes to government officials and officers of state in a number of countries in relation to the oil and gas sector”.

Jonathan Hall, the SFO’s QC, told the court that the agency “had reasonable grounds to suspect that Unaoil’s main activity is the paying of bribes on behalf of western oil infrastructure companies and the corrupting of tendering exercises to favour its clients”.

The SFO said it was concerned “that the effect of this flawed claim [by Unaoil] – whether that is its purpose or otherwise – will be to delay and disrupt an ongoing criminal investigation into serious fraud and corruption”.

Judgment will be given at a later date.

Life has not been easy for Paradise Sorouri. In the past seven years, the 27-year-old has been forced to flee her country twice, received more death threats than she can count, and was brutally beaten by 10 men on the street and left to die. Her crime? She covers her head with a baseball cap instead of a hijab, raises her voice for women’s rights, and is Afghanistan’s first female rapper.

In a country where, according to the UN, 87% of women have endured physical or sexual violence, Paradise’s scathing lyrics about gender inequality in post-Taliban Afghanistan have served as a spark for change and a lightning rod for controversy. She raps defiantly in Dari about how women can get acid poured on their faces for resisting rape, be married off as children to older men, and belong to husbands who can set them on fire.



“It doesn’t matter if you are a singer, an artist, or a teacher,” says Paradise. “If you are a woman in Afghanistan, you are a problem. I am speaking out and fighting for women who don’t have a voice.”

Speaking out has come at a price, but it has also garnered support. Paradise was recognised by the UN in 2013 for promoting human rights, while she and her fiance Diverse – together they are known as 143Band – won the Afghan ATN network’s award for best rap act in 2015. The duo are nominated again this year.

But as her popularity soared, so did the number of violent threats she received. Fearing for their safety, last year she and Diverse fled Afghanistan and joined the more than one million migrants who arrived in Germany from the Middle East. 



In the process, the pair have begun to reach an entirely new audience, writing and producing songs in their Berlin flat and touring throughout Germany. They release their first music video in two years next month for the song Bosaye Eshgh, they’ve just headlined at the international FeminEast festival in Stockholm, and Rebel Beats, a documentary about Paradise’s struggle as Afghanistan’s first female rapper, will appear in European film festivals early next year.

Born in Iran to Afghan parents who escaped the country’s civil war, Paradise moved back to Herat, Afghanistan’s third largest city, with her family following the fall of the Taliban. She grew up idolising Tupac, Eminem and Beyoncé though didn’t know anyone who shared her love of hip-hop until she met Diverse – another former refugee just back from Iran. The two decided to start making music together in 2008, but the odds were against them.

“Herat is a very religious city,” says Diverse. “Sharia law forbids women to sing. The fact that we are not married was also a problem. Every time we’d try to go to a studio together, strangers would start following us.”



One night, Paradise was walking home with her younger brother when 10 men on six motorcycles surrounded her and started beating her with wooden rods. “They were shouting at me and saying I was a bad influence on other women by trying to make music,” Paradise says. “All I could do was to try to defend my brother. They passed me from one man to the next. I begged people nearby to help, but they just urged the men to beat me to death.”

When Diverse found her, Paradise’s clothes were torn and she was covered in blood. He immediately took her to the police. “They told me I should stop singing,” says Paradise. “That’s when I knew that if I stayed silent, nothing would change.”

Fearful of what might happen if they stayed in Herat, the couple moved to neighbouring Tajikistan in late 2010, where Paradise began writing songs about women’s rights over Diverse’s beats. The following year, they released Faryad-e Zan (Woman’s Shout), the first song ever to feature a female Afghan rapper. In the years since, Paradise says she feels “proud and honoured” to have ushered in a handful of other female rappers, even if several have claimed to be the country’s first while simultaneously asking her for guidance.

During the next two years, the duo recorded nine more songs and shot five videos in the relative safety of Tajikistan. Then, in the summer of 2012, Paradise received horrific news: back in Herat, to avoid being married off to men in their 60s, her two young cousins – aged nine and 12 – had burned themselves alive.

Devastated, Paradise returned to Afghanistan and recorded a song in their memory called Nalestan. “I wanted to think and they hit me in the head,” she sang. “They burned my face in the name of Islam / And sold me because I’m only a woman.” The song won international attention, with 143Band named Afghanistan’s best rap artist at the 2014 Rumi world music awards.

“The success of Nalestan was both good and bad,” Paradise says. “We were interviewed by journalists from all over the world, but I started to get death threats every day. It got so bad I had to stay inside my sister’s house in Herat for a month like a prisoner.” Still, Paradise and Diverse were convinced their message of female empowerment would be more effective if they stayed in Afghanistan, so they relocated once more, this time to Kabul.

When Rebel Beats began filming in early 2015, a woman named Farkhunda – who was falsely accused of burning the Qur’an – had just been beaten to death and set alight by an angry mob in the street. The daily barrage of threats directed at Paradise had also reached a fever pitch and, throughout the film, she anxiously looks over her shoulder to see if she’s being watched.



At one point, the camera holds on a stony-faced Paradise as she reads message after message directed at her on 143Band’s Facebook page. Several men describe wanting to rape and behead her in front of Diverse. Another says he’ll throw acid on her if he ever sees her in person. The only time she breaks is when she’s asked about Farkhunda. “She has made me stronger,” Paradise says, fighting back the tears. “I will fight – not only for Farkhunda, but for all the Farkhundas.”

A month after the cameras stopped rolling, Paradise and Diverse left Afghanistan for good and began the arduous process of resettling in Berlin. Paradise is still fighting and is scheduled to speak at Talking Taboo, an international conference for women’s rights in London on 2 December.

“The people of Afghanistan still need our voice,” she says. “From here, we can make it louder.”

Extra legal powers may be needed to prosecute hate preachers who encourage violent radicalisation in private conversations, according to the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation.

In his final report after six years in the influential post, David Anderson QC says the requirement in the 2006 Terrorism Act that such persuasion needs to be “published” or delivered at a meeting should be re-examined.

“That change might make it possible to use undercover officers for the purposes of gathering evidence against those who are inspiring terrorists,” he suggests.

It may also be necessary to specify more clearly “examples of ways in which support for a proscribed organisation could be invited”, he explains. “Prosecutors with experience of such cases have told me that this could assist juries in matching the alleged conduct to the offence.”

Anderson, who stands down in February, was not formally recommending such changes but believed there should be a more detailed inquiry. “I offer them for discussion as a possible partial solution to the problems of prosecuting hate preachers,” he writes, “and in the spirit that our freedoms are better protected by a well-functioning criminal law than they are by a system based on coercive civil orders of broad and uncertain scope.”

Anderson says: “It is entirely fair to ask why the law did not catch up with Anjem Choudary [who was convicted of inviting support for Daesh earlier this year] sooner.” He said the Crown Prosecution Service considered Choudary’s activities on 10 occasions between 2002 and 2015.

In general conclusions, Anderson observes: “Laws against terrorism need to bear down hard on all kinds of extremists who espouse violence: but it is important also that they do not alienate the rest of the population.”

He welcomes the steady decline in the number of so-called port stops, used to question and detain travellers to determine whether they are involved in terrorism. They have fallen from 87,218 in 2009-10 to 28,083 last year.



“My overall impression is that though port controls remain a frequently mentioned irritant, the terrorism acts are no longer the focus for grievance that they once were,” Anderson notes. “Indeed they have been overtaken as a source of grievance by aspects of the Prevent strategy to counter extremism.”

The terrorism acts, he says, “are a broadly proportionate reaction to the current threat”. He states: “I reject the false narrative of power-hungry security services, police insensitivity to community concerns, and laws constantly being ratcheted up to new levels of oppression.”

However, Brexit could damage the UK’s ability to lead European policy and promote European laws in the counter-terrorism field, Anderson says.

He adds: “There are strong operational reasons for maintaining access to EU mechanisms that others may devise. Brexit will not alter the fact that as crime [including terrorist crime] crosses borders with increasing ease, the same must be true of the information and resources that are needed by those who fight it.”

In the report, written after the murder of the Labour MP Jo Cox by the Nazi sympathiser Thomas Mair, Anderson says: “The organised extreme rightwing threat in the UK is … perceived by the authorities to be fragmented, with no unifying ideology or set of principles. 



“In a document provided to me by the national counter-terrorism policing operations centre in July 2016, the threat of organised XRW groups was described as … ‘limited to low-level protest and heated online debate’.”

There were no deaths or injuries from terrorism in Britain during 2015, the report says, “unless one counts the injuries sustained by Lyle Zimmerman at Leytonstone tube station in London in December”. In Northern Ireland, there were three security-related deaths in the year to 31 March 2016.

The report adds: “Outside Northern Ireland, there have been only two deaths in the UK from terrorist incidents since 56 people [including four British suicide bombers] were killed in the 7/7 London attacks of 2005. The continuation of that record is impressive.”

The threat remains, however: “Some attackers or would-be attackers leave only a very limited intelligence trace, particularly if their radicalisation has been swift. 



“Others come to the attention of the authorities but are not given the priority that their subsequent actions show them to have merited, often for understandable reasons. And as was demonstrated recently in Nice, even such an everyday object as a large motor vehicle can exact a horrible toll on the innocent when used by a person heedless of the consequences for his own life.”

In his parting comments, Anderson observes: “Human rights do not hamper the fight against terrorism and extremism: they underline its legitimacy.”

Much has been written recently about the shocking conditions inside Britain’s jails. Suicides are occurring on average once every three days, and prison inspectors said this week that conditions in HMP Hindley are among the worst they have ever seen.

It’s about time that prisons stopped being holiday camps. Or at least that is what the Daily Mail would encourage you to think. If you ask the average person on the street why someone would end up in prison, you are likely to get some version of: “Because they have chosen to break the law and have harmed someone else.” And on prison’s purpose? “They should be harsh places of punishment to set an example and act as a deterrent.”

I work in the criminal justice system and have committed a large proportion of my life to trying to support offenders to turn their lives around. So you might expect me to argue against that statement, to try to blame the wider socio-economic picture and present a social justice argument about how we are all to blame for the crimes committed by these men and women.

However I completely agree that those who choose to commit crime should face incarceration. That prisons should be well run by the prison staff; who as society’s representatives in prison should be setting the agenda, holding firm boundaries and delivering society’s intention to both punish the offender and to minimise the chances of them choosing to break the law in the future. So on that level, I believe that the current situation in prisons is a travesty. Prisons are chronically understaffed and the inmates have far more power than ever before.

Contraband is commonplace. Where there is contraband, there is trade and where there is trade, there are people who control that trade who have status and power that they will seek to maintain. We have allowed a situation to develop where prison becomes an environment where the very traits and tendencies that we would hope prison would diminish are in fact reinforced, as legitimate strategies for survival and for status.

Staff shortages are now so acute that in many prisons, prisoners are spending 23 hours a day locked up – denied access to education and training, exercise and other activity proved to decrease the likelihood to reoffending.

So even from that paradigm, of prisons being for people who have chosen to break the law, the situation in prisons is unacceptable.

However in our experience of working with young men involved in the criminal justice system, the percentage of those who consciously chose to break the law or harm another is small.

The others fall into two camps. The first are those who see the supply of drugs to the marketplace as a victimless activity and the best means of making a living they have available, as an unskilled young male with no qualifications. The second group are those so lacking in maturity that they end up committing crimes, not through an active, conscious choice but a failure of impulse control in the moment.

It is easy to judge both of those groups and to believe them to be as deserving of punishment. I know I did. Before I had exposure to the reality of the lives they lived, I held strong views, typical of the middle-class culture in which I grew up. I judged drug dealers as preying on the weak in our society and was simply afraid of those who were so volatile and unpredictable. I wanted them taken away.

I am now rather embarrassed to have held those views. Over the past decade working with offenders, I have had a number of realisations. The first is that young men do not fully mature psychologically until they are in their mid-20s – something that can be backed up by research and evidence. I now count myself as fortunate that my middle-class circumstances as a young man meant that my own behaviour through a lack of maturity did not bring me into contact with the criminal justice system.

The second realisation builds on that theme of “there but for the winds of fate go I”. I have heard some truly heart-breaking stories of neglect and abuse. I have worked with young men who have been victims of sexual abuse, who as small children witnessed terrible domestic violence in the home, even watching their mother being raped. I have had to ask myself whether if I’d had similar experiences, I would be where I am today. The answer is a resounding no. Emerging neuroscience supports this conclusion, especially for males.

The tragedy is that putting these vulnerable young men into a toxic prison environment is likely to decrease their chances of building a successful life for themselves. Being exposed to further trauma, living in a dangerous environment (resulting in an almost constantly adrenalised state), where drugs are freely available and where positive role models are in short supply, are possibly the worst conditions in which to try to effect positive change. Is it any surprise that suicides happen so frequently?

Things were bad enough. The advent of “spice” and other synthetic cannabis substances creates a huge additional challenge in the prison environment. An odourless drug that is difficult to detect and can cause psychosis – especially in people who have experienced early-years trauma. Prison staff and others in the system have described it as a game-changer.

We the taxpayers are currently spending around £35,000 per prisoner per year to provide places in these institutions that on almost every level are failing. In 1993, the prison population was 44,000. It’s now 80,000.

The current system needs a radical rethink and a more nuanced approach to understand the reasons for offending and providing a sentence that is appropriate and has a chance of success. Until we start thinking in these terms and talking about “sentencing reform”, rather than simply “prison reform”, we are likely to retain a system that costs huge amounts of money, the lives of vulnerable people and the loss of human potential.

A judge who asked a complainant in a sexual assault trial why she couldn’t just keep her knees together should be removed from the bench, an inquiry tasked with probing the matter has concluded.



In a unanimous recommendation released on Wednesday, the five-person inquiry committee of the Canadian Judicial Council said Robin Camp “committed misconduct” while presiding over a 2014 trial into allegations of sexual assault.

The judge’s conduct, the committee said in its report, “was so manifestly and profoundly destructive of the concept of the impartiality, integrity and independence of the judicial role that public confidence is sufficiently undermined to render the judge incapable of executing the judicial office”.

The Calgary trial made headlines around the world after it emerged that Camp had repeatedly asked the 19-year-old complainant why she hadn’t done more to prevent the alleged rape. “Why couldn’t you just keep your knees together?” Camp asked her. Later he told her that “sex and pain sometimes go together”.

Throughout the trial, Camp erroneously referred to her as “the accused”. At one point he asked the complainant – who said the alleged assault took place on a bathroom sink – why she hadn’t sunk her “bottom down into the basin so he couldn’t penetrate you”.

Camp went on to acquit the man accused in the case. The Alberta court of appeal later ordered a new trial.

In September, an inquiry began looking into whether Camp – a provincial judge who had been recently promoted to the Federal court – should be removed from the bench.

The inquiry heard a remorseful Camp apologise for his remarks. “I was not the good judge I thought I was,” said the 64-year-old. Camp, who was born in South Africa and moved to Calgary in 1998, said he had not understood the changes made to Canadian laws aimed at sheltering sexual assault complainants from discriminatory attitudes.

The inquiry also heard from the female complainant, who said Camp’s remarks had left her grappling with suicidal thoughts. “What did he get from asking that?” she asked. “He made me hate myself and he made me feel like I should have done something … that I was some kind of slut.”

On Wednesday, the inquiry committee said Camp’s questions showed “an antipathy towards laws designed to protect vulnerable witnesses, promote equality and bring integrity to sexual assault trials.” The judge, they added, also relied on “discredited myths and stereotypes about women and victim-blaming during the trial and in his reasons for judgment.”

The recommendation will now be considered by the Canadian Judicial Council. Camp will be invited to make written submissions before the council issues a formal recommendation on his fate to Canada’s justice minister.

A tough alternative to prison, possibly involving “visible” work punishments in the community, should be more readily available to judges, the lord chief justice has suggested.



Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd has called for a debate on how to develop more challenging sentences that would allow offenders to be kept out of jail.

“The most difficult decision a judge ever has to make is whether someone should be sent to prison or not,” the lord chief justice said at his annual press conference in the Royal Courts of Justice on Wednesday. 



“If you are sending someone to prison for a very short time, the ability of the prison to cope with that person is limited in the current circumstances. It’s very important that you have real alternatives to prison. It’s important you have tough community sentences available … and this is something at which we really need to look.

“Should you have some really tough kind of work for [offenders] to do? Should you make the punishment visible? What’s essential is that you have a tough alternative to prison … These are things on which it would be good to have a proper open debate.” 



Fifteen years ago there was a low level of confidence in the probation service, Thomas said. That had now improved but there was still a need for better communication.

“Every judge should go to prison once a year,” Thomas said. “You need to know where you are sending people … The judiciary needs to have confidence and the press needs to see what is being done to rehabilitate or punish people.” 



There are already provisions for offenders carrying out unpaid work such as removing graffiti, clearing wasteland and decorating public places to be required to wear a high-visibility orange vest, however they are not widely used.



In 2008, Labour introduced vests with the words “community payback” written on the back for criminals on community service, a move that attracted controversy and criticism.

Thomas’s comments come as jails in England and Wales endure a turbulent period. This month thousands of prison officers staged a walkout amid claims the system was “in meltdown” after a rise in violence and self-harm. There are more than 85,000 people in prison in England and Wales.

Asked about the large number of prisoners still being held in jail under indefinite sentences for the protection of the public (IPPs) and who have served far longer than their original tariff, Thomas acknowledged that it was “a problem and I’m very glad to see the numbers coming down.”

This month Michael Gove, the former justice secretary, warned that too many people were being sent to prison.

A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: “Protecting the public will always be our top priority. Our message is simple: if you commit a serious offence, you should expect to go to prison.

“Sentencing is a matter for independent judges, and the sentencing council recently published new guidelines to make sure sentences accurately reflect the seriousness of the crime.”

Last year 8,600 probation staff were outsourced as part of the privatisation of more than half of the probation service in England and Wales.

In 2014, seven-year-long contracts for rehabilitation services worth £3.7bn were awarded to companies such as Staffline, Sodexo and MTCnovo to supervise low and medium-risk offenders. Those who are deemed high-risk are still supervised by the National Probation Service.

Theresa May should unilaterally pass legislation to secure the rights of up to 3 million European Union citizens to stay in Britain or risk souring the tone of the Brexit talks, according to Labour’s Keir Starmer.

The shadow Brexit secretary said May should act immediately and abandon her increasingly controversial position of refusing to make any concession over the rights of EU citizens in the UK without securing equivalent guarantees for the 1.2 million UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU.

“It’s becoming increasingly apparent to me from my discussions in Brussels with those that are likely to be involved in the negotiations that they are very concerned about the fact that we are not giving comfort and status to their citizens,” he told the Guardian.



“They have said to me, pretty well in terms, the UK should sort this out before March, and that would ensure that the article 50 negotiations got off to a much better start than they will otherwise do.”

Relations between the UK and the rest of the EU have become increasingly heated on the topic. On Tuesday the European council president, Donald Tusk, published a strongly worded letter to a group of Conservative MPs saying the issue would have to wait for formal negotiations to begin and appeared to blame the British electorate for causing the uncertainty in the first place.

Starmer described Tusk’s letter as unhelpful, but said it “points to the need to act unilaterally now, and is further evidence of the unhelpful atmosphere that has been created in the lead-up to the negotiations”.



In his letter Tusk added: “The only way to dispel the fears and doubts of all citizens concerned is the quickest possible start of the negotiations based on article 50 of the treaty.”

But Starmer, the MP for Holborn and St Pancras in London, said the government should take more urgent action as a goodwill gesture before formal talks begin. “Everywhere you go there is a mounting sense of very real injustice. I think everybody feels it; it’s across parties, and it can’t be left unresolved any longer.”

At prime minister’s questions on Wednesday, May defended her approach. She said: “I think the reaction that we have seen shows it was absolutely right for us not to do what the Labour party wanted us to do, which was simply to give away the guarantee for rights of EU citizens here in the UK. As we have seen, that would have left UK citizens in Europe high and dry.”



The government has suggested the vast majority of those EU citizens already living in the UK are likely to be entitled to apply for permanent residence, because they have been here for more than five years. But Starmer said that could be a bureaucratic and unwieldy process and could overwhelm the resources of the Home Office. He added that “permanent residence” was an EU concept, which would be expected to fall away when Britain leaves.

Instead, he suggested the government could “pass a domestic law, dealing with the status of these individuals, and it would get cross-party support, and could be passed very swiftly”.

He added: “At the very least there ought to be clarity for those who were already here on 23 June.”

The bad blood between London and Brussels over the future of EU citizens was indicative of a wider problem with the tone the government had adopted as it approached the coming negotiations, Starmer claimed, warning about “mixed messages” from London.

He contrasted May’s Conservative party conference speech, widely interpreted as signalling she favoured hard Brexit, with reassurances subsequently given to Nissan about continued access to the single market.

“It’s very difficult to suggest that what [May] said at conference and the Nissan assurance are the same thing, and so mixed messages are being received in Brussels. That is not healthy.”

He added that the sometimes jocular tone of the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, risked offending his EU counterparts. “They perceive an arrogance on behalf of the UK, and Boris Johnson may think he’s very amusing in his approach, but my perception is our EU partners are not in the mood for that kind of amusement.” He added: “We need to make sure that the tone is right.”

With just four months to go until May’s self-imposed end-of-March deadline for triggering article 50, Starmer said he believed there was still a tussle within the government about what kind of relationship with the EU it wanted to aim at when negotiations began.

“I think they haven’t come to a final view, and that is because the argument about Europe that has been going on for years in the Tory party has broken out like never before,” he said. “It’s become an argument about the very future of our country.”



Labour’s own stance on Brexit has sometimes appeared less than unanimous, and senior party figures have told the Guardian that Starmer himself – one of the highest profile promotions when Jeremy Corbyn refilled his frontbench after the summer leadership challenge – is being “man marked”.

He underlined Corbyn’s insistence that the party would not seek to block the triggering of article 50 – but did not rule out amending any legislation the government brings to parliament, to force May to reveal more about her negotiating stance.

“We won’t frustrate the process, but we do want to put some grip and grit into the process, to ensure that parliament and the public know the prime minister’s starting position,” he said. Asked if that could mean Labour tabling amendments to any bill, he said: “So long as it doesn’t frustrate the process, then it is important to look at options.”

Asked whether Brexit presented “enormous opportunities”, as the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, recently said, Starmer replied: “I think there are huge risks in Brexit; and I see the task of the Labour party as being to ensure that we get the best possible outcome that works for everybody in the UK.”

He also struck a somewhat different tone from the shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, on how Labour should tackle voters’ concerns about immigration.



Starmer crisscrossed the country earlier this year as shadow immigration minister – a job Abbott has not taken on herself alongside the home affairs brief.

Abbott used a recent interview to insist that Labour must champion the benefits of immigration, or risk becoming “Ukip-lite”.

Starmer said it was right to praise the contribution of migrants to Britain’s economy and society. But he said hundreds of conversations across the north-east, north-west, east and Wales had convinced him that “Labour needs to have a better answer for those that are concerned about immigration”.

“I don’t think we can hide from that, and don’t think frankly it was just the referendum. I think this has been a growing issue for five or 10 years, and it’s an issue on which Labour needs to get on the front foot, and off the back foot, and that means we have got to listen to what people are telling us are their concerns.”

Abbott and the shadow business secretary, Clive Lewis, have suggested that boosting trade union rights to enhance workers’ bargaining power and prevent wages being undercut could help allay voters’ concerns.

But Starmer insisted the party should also develop new policies on integrating different ethnic groups – an issue likely to be tackled in a forthcoming review by Louise Casey.

“There is a big labour market element to it of course,” Starmer said, but he added: “I do think there is a wider piece about how our communities live together, and we ensure that integration works in a way that benefits everybody, and by that I mean as much those arriving as those who are already here.

“That’s a debate that Labour have not engaged in at all really over recent years. And we shouldn’t be scared of this territory. In a sense, we don’t want to hear what people are saying to us; we just sort of move the conversation on. And my concern is Labour are not seen to be listening on this, and we need to be.”

Four Metropolitan police officers who say they were “branded abusive thugs” after the arrest of terror suspect Babar Ahmad 13 years ago have won the right to seek damages in the high court.

After a long legal battle, the court of appeal ruled the four could bring an action for compensation against the Met commissioner for “letting them down badly” by failing to robustly defend them over Ahmad’s claim that they had beaten him up.

The Met agreed in March 2009 to pay £60,000 damages to Ahmad after an admission that officers subjected him to a “serious, gratuitous and prolonged” attack.

Ahmad said he was punched, kicked and throttled during his arrest by officers from the Met’s territorial support group in December 2003.

The Met initially denied the claims, saying officers used reasonable force.

But lawyers for the force’s then commissioner, Sir Paul Stephenson, admitted at the high court that Ahmad had been the victim of gratuitous and sustained violence at his home in Tooting, south-west London.

The four officers – Pc Rod James-Bowen, Pc Nigel Cowley, Pc Mark Jones and DC John Donohue – were charged with various criminal offences. After a five-week hearing at Southwark crown court in 2011, the jury acquitted them of all charges.

The officers launched their own damages action against the Met commissioner.



A high court judge struck down their case in its entirety, but three appeal judges ruled on Wednesday that the four were entitled to bring their claim “for economic and reputational harm based on a breach of a duty of care at common law”.

The latest attempt by tobacco companies to prevent the introduction of mandatory plain packaging of cigarettes in the UK has been rejected by the court of appeal.

The judgment is a fresh blow to companies who face having to replace their current heavily branded distinctive packs with boxes that are indistinguishable from each other bar the brand name on the packet in standard typeface, colour and size.

The regulations aim to reduce the appeal and uptake of smoking, by children and young people in particular, help smokers to quit, prevent misleading packaging, and give greater prominence to health warnings.



But British American, Imperial, Japan International and Philip Morris claim that the move would infringe their human and intellectual property rights.



In May, the high court rejected their arguments, the day before the tobacco products directive of the EU took effect. Some of the companies took the case to the court of appeal last month but, on Wednesday, the three judges, sitting at the Royal Courts of Justice in central London, dismissed the challenge.

Lord Justice Lewison, Lord Justice Beatson and Sir Stephen Richards ruled that the health secretary had “lawfully exercised his powers”.

The companies now have the option of appealing to the supreme court.



Nicola Blackwood, the public health and innovation minister, said: “Standardised packaging will help cut smoking rates and reduce suffering, disease and loss of life. We are pleased that this decision will help many people to lead longer and healthier lives.”

Since May, legal challenge notwithstanding, companies have been forbidden from making packets that do not comply with the directive. However, they are allowed to sell off existing cigarette stocks until May next year, which means plain packets will only emerge in the shops gradually. 



The new packs will be the same shape, size and colour (green) and 65% of the front and back surfaces will be covered by picture health warnings, with written warnings on the sides.

Deborah Arnott, the chief executive of the health charity Ash, said: “This is a victory for public health and another crushing defeat for the tobacco industry. This ruling should also encourage other countries to press ahead with standardised packaging, now that the industry’s arguments have yet again been shown to be without foundation.”

Simon Clark, the director of the smokers’ group Forest, said: “By stigmatising the product, the government is also targeting the user. Plain packs are unlikely to deter people from smoking but the impact on consumer choice could be significant because some brands will almost certainly disappear from the market.

“Tobacco is a legal product. The law should not impose excessive regulations on consumers who know the health risks and don’t need this type of finger-wagging measure.”

The Forest website says Forest is supported by British American Tobacco, Imperial Tobacco Limited and Gallaher Limited, a member of the Japan Tobacco group of companies.

I serve on the independent monitoring board at Bedford jail where prisoners rioted this month. For the past eight years I have visited the prison about once a week. Every prison in England and Wales has an IMB of ordinary citizens, appointed by the justice secretary in much the same way as are magistrates. Their voluntary job is to monitor whether prisons do what they say on the tin – provide a safe and secure environment within which to help prisoners lead law-abiding and useful lives in custody and after they are released. Members visit their prison unaccompanied and unannounced, and have unfettered access to it.

In August, the IMB was so concerned for the safety of prisoners and staff that it took the unprecedented step of writing to the prisons minister, Sam Gyimah, asking for his urgent help.

HMP Bedford is a small, busy jail that holds about 500 prisoners, both remanded from the courts in neighbouring towns and others whose sentence plans are still being worked out prior to their dispersal elsewhere. It is located in the town centre, with excellent communications for staff and prisoners’ families, a location that allows, in principle, for extensive partnerships and engagements with local communities. But the antiquated buildings and facilities are desperately in need of renovation to make them fit-for-purpose (typically two grown men living, sleeping, eating and relieving themselves in cells built ungenerously in 1850 for one man, now with an unscreened WC and basin in place of two tin buckets).

The IMB’s last two annual reports – to the end of June 2015 and June 2016 – warned that the jail was in need of infrastructural investment, overcrowded by as much as 50%, and perilously under-staffed.

Within prisons drugs, violence and merciless bullying are endemic. The mix is toxic and threatening, a damaging punishment over and above the deprivation of liberty, autonomy and contact with your roots. Surely no judge intended such suffering when passing sentence?

Some lessons were learned a decade before I started visiting prisons: individuals need to be treated with decency, both because they are individual human beings and because rehabilitative efforts were shown to be futile in the absence of respect. Prisons can furthermore only be run economically by consent – an implicit pact between prisoners and staff, which depends upon the prisoners perceiving the prison management’s use of authority as having legitimacy. Decency thus has a crucial central place, in lock-step with rehabilitation, in securing cost-effectiveness.

The decency agenda has raised standards, but it requires continual attention which it has been often impossible to sustain in recent years as ”‘austerity” has swept through the prison estate. A series of savings-driven restructuring programmes have lowered salaries, changed terms of employment, drastically reduced staffing levels and deskilled officers. Capital and maintenance budgets have been slashed. Governors’ autonomy has been progressively eroded, not least by a long series of expensive and quite possibly ill-judged outsourcing contracts. The impacts have been devastating, and form the backdrop to the riots at HMP Bedford.

For prisons to deliver rehabilitation, on top of secure containment, there needs to be: a decent, structured, calm and uncrowded environment; sufficient numbers of committed staff who have the skill to go way beyond the (already very difficult) running of a safe jail, by working individually with every prisoner; ample opportunities for prisoners to use their time constructively (remedial and more ambitious education, training, work); and consistently superlative leadership and dedication to purpose throughout the system. By August this year, the cost-cutting programmes of the last few years had bitten hard into HMP Bedford. Many experienced staff members had left the service for better-respected and remunerated employment, necessitating the deployment of inexperienced officers. Recruitment and retention difficulties, (uncompetitive salaries set against the difficulty of the job) and long-term sickness were so serious that it was no longer possible to deliver the full range of required out-of-cell activities (opportunites to socialise with other prisoners, shower, make telephone calls, exercise, education, work etc) safely.

Opportunities for prisoners to be involved in any constructive employment were already drastically reduced and were fast vanishing. Instead, prisoners locked in their cells – often for up to 23 hours a day. These unplanned and unannounced “bang-ups” unsettled the prisoners as well as reinforcing their boredom. Staff shortages and rotations had become so severe that officers had insufficient time even to get to know the prisoners in their charge, let alone attend to their needs. The use of drugs had spiralled, and with that trade, the bullying of the weak and vulnerable. The incidence of self-harm and of violent assaults, both prisoner-on-prisoner and prisoner-on-staff, was rising alarmingly.

There was increasing rumour of prisoner unrest. The IMB was hearing accounts from officers that they were becoming afraid to work on the prison’s largest wing. The IMB letter to the minister warned that staff shortages were “beyond crisis point” and of the “alarming rise in prisoners attempting to hang themselves”. In the 10 weeks between the posting of the letter and the minister’s response, two prisoners were found hanged.

Gyimah’s reply, dated 27 October, however, was written very much in the register adopted for the minister’s acknowledgement of the IMB’s annual report. It gave airy explanations of how the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) agency, the National Offender Management Service (Noms), and the senior prison officers were coping with the IMB’s concerns, while conveying nothing more urgent in intention than a pat on the head. In effect, he was saying: “This is a prison! If you can’t stand the heat, keep out of the kitchen. Sorry to hear that it has made you anxious.” Less than two weeks later, on Sunday 6 November, the prison erupted in a widely reported riot involving more than 200 men from two wings. The incident of “concerted indiscipline” stopped short of catastrophe because: the officers on duty read the seriousness of the situation in time to withdraw, by degrees, and deprive the rioters both of hostages and keys; because of the sang-froid of the governor, as she took charge of the incident in the “command suite”; and because the prisoners were intent more on making a protest than on blood. This last may be a surprise to many, but I believe it to have been the case. Two residential wings and the central office and observation area were comprehensively trashed, nonetheless.

Surveying the devastation a couple of days later, an IMB colleague and I were approached by two experienced officers, who were plainly deeply affected by the riot. They wanted us to see the graffiti – versions of “If you treat us like animals, we will eventually behave like animals”, which implied that, at that moment, the prisoners and officers saw the prison in the same light. These officers were acutely aware that the extreme working environment they had experienced for months was paralleled by the stress they had imposed on the desperate prisoners. Behind their emotion lay the cataclysmic loss of trust. When this collapses, then all that you have worked to achieve seems to have failed. The officers were devastated.

The prisoners involved in the riot have been sent, in small batches, to prisons across the country. When they return, as many surely will (they are essentially local men) after the wings have been refurbished and the staffing problems have been resolved, I expect to hear similar deeply felt stories of betrayed trust from them, because there is never only one side to a story.

The inner turmoil experienced by the staff members on duty at the time of the riot has been debilitating. They had to take the awful decision to withdraw, abandoning the prison and vulnerable prisoners. The senior management team are racked with guilt that things came to this pass under their command.

Many rioters will only have participated for fear of violent reprisals if they abstained, creating fear at the time and complicated long-term consequences for them in the future. Even the instigators merit understanding – of their circumstances, if not of their actions. They may have been more hot-headed than others, but the prisoners had collectively been driven to desperation by the poverty and randomness of the regime. Nonetheless, prisoners and staff connived, in a sense, to bring the insurrection under control before any mortal damage was done. It is interesting that they left the library untouched.

It would be easy to attribute blame for the riot to the local actors, but that would represent a profound injustice and a failure to understand the horrors and complexities of prison. The staff at all levels at HMP Bedford have awed me by their consistent courage, loyalty, resilience, ready sense of decency and professionalism in the face of increasingly overwhelming odds. This was evidenced over months of difficulty and in spades on the day of the riot when prisoners, having stoically endured a seemingly endlessly deteriorating and irregular regime, lost faith in the prison management’s use of authority as having legitimacy, abandoned the implicit pact, and “kicked off”. They had cried for help, as had the IMB, the officers, and the governor to her superiors – but no one at the top of the tree heard their pleas. Who, then, was blameworthy?

I arrive at the following conclusions. The cost-cutting demanded of Noms, and, by extension, of individual prisons, has taken on the dimensions of an extreme human experiment, which in the social sciences these days would be blocked on ethical grounds. . There was no attempt to introduce these reforms gradually at a national level, or on a pilot basis, and then learn from the experience. There was no “evidence base” for these reforms. and no attempt to collect any. They were thus driven purely by ideology and finance. In general, the prison system seems reluctant to set up mechanisms whereby it can learn from its mistakes. The trial has failed also because the premise upon which it was based is misconceived. Prisons are being asked to achieve the unachievable.

Successive ministers have cut costs in the face of insistent warnings from many quarters, including the prison officers’ and the prison governors’ associations, the chief inspector of prisons, the IMBs and the many prison reform lobbying organisations. The only response has been about readjusting budgets over an extended period. Even though the new justice secretary, Liz Truss, has acknowledged (in her recent white paper) that cost-cutting has driven prisons to an extreme where they are not even able to operate safely, no proportionate or urgent action has been taken by the politicians and top civil servants in the MoJ who are responsible for the crisis in prisons. This is a devastating failure of accountability. They must acknowledge responsibility for the damage done.

The recent prison riots are testimony to a slow-burn build-up of misery and conflict that has blighted the lives of the prison’s many communities. I would particularly highlight the intolerable burdens that have been placed on officers and managers, as this is seldom sufficiently recognised. At last, it is being acknowledged that prisons cannot  be reformed without high-quality, motivated staff – and this is not simply about having the money to pay them a decent salary (although that is a necessary precondition).

Staff members have to be assured that their contribution is valued and that they will be trained and supported to do a difficult job in a meaningful way, especially when they are in the early stages of their career. Most prison officers do not go into the service to bang people up, but to help people change. Making the job so mechanical that it loses its meaning has led to a situation where it is as difficult to retain staff as it is to recruit them.

Criminal justice is a political playground, leading to endless changes in emphasis and policy. Prison budgets have not been ringfenced during “austerity”. In consequence, we have massively overcrowded and under-staffed older prisons, some of which are truly shocking, and that is unworthy of a nation that instinctively tends to assume it is a moral model for the rest of the world. Across the country, our prisons have failed to deliver against their social contract to “reform” offenders – so systematically that it is unclear that prisons (especially large ones) can ever deliver this while the political climate remains as it is.

A new vision is needed with an emphasis on integrating and accessing the insight contained within the system, . One such vision comprises three principal departures from current thinking. First, sentencing guidance would change radically to substitute community penalties for imprisonment for the vast majority of offences. for which research has shown that incarceration does not generally reduce reoffending. Second, there would be a properly resourced community sentence and probation service centre (CSPSC) in every major town to provide offenders with support, advice, help with housing and employment, remedial education and vocational training, alongside traditional probation service functions. Third, integrated into these centres would be small and local prisons so that all but the few prisoners who need high security jails more security and with intensive support to live safely, remain close to their roots. These new integrated centres would work most effectively if they formed a thriving and well-connected part of local life.

And what of the future for HMP Bedford? Its accessibility is such a huge asset that it merits the necessary investment, as long as the prison population is reduced to a level that allows it to offer personal attention, in a safe and calm environment overseen by an adequate number of experienced staff. Only then can a rehabilitative ethos have a chance to be effective.

It could even take part in the pilot roll-out of my proposed CSPSCs.

Zoe Williams (Forget Fidel Castro’s policies. Above all, he was a dictator, 28November) bases her judgment of Castro on a frighteningly simplistic division of states into democracies, by implication multiparty ones, and dictatorships, by implication any state that is not multiparty. She then makes a blanket assertion that the latter are so inherently bad that their actual record of government is irrelevant. This is to ignore all the complex details of political structures by which a population can be oppressed or empowered. For us, from a practical point of view, the worst danger of such thinking is to exaggerate the benefits of our political system.

While Castro may be rightly criticised for executing Batista supporters, even those guilty of torture and multiple murder, it may be salutary to remember that back then, in 1959, Britain executed people accused of a single murder. It was also a time when British forces were imprisoning and torturing Kenyans, and those of the French multiparty democracy were torturing and killing Algerians. Even those crimes pale before the horrors the US multiparty democracy was shortly to unleash on Vietnam.

Turning to the present day and the issue of political freedoms, it is fair to condemn Cuba if people are being arrested for oppositional comment but important to bear in mind that the distinction between criticism and treachery is controversial, as illustrated by the fate of Chelsea Manning. It is reasonable to argue that a single-party state lacks effective mechanisms for kicking out an unpopular government, but we should also wonder whether the convergence of mainstream parties behind austerity and the increasingly low turnouts at elections in the UK are a sign that our mechanisms have ceased to be effective.

• While UK press coverage of Fidel Castro’s death has been largely hostile, my own views and memories are mixed, as I was “our man in Havana” for Reuters from 1960 to 1962, a period spanning the Bay of Pigs debacle and the Cuban missile crisis.

In July 1962, well after midnight, I, my wife Olivia and Gavin Young of the Observer were walking near the Hotel Nacional when we saw a large car and a familiar silhouette. Gavin rashly stuck his hand in at the car window, introduced himself and said: “Come and have a drink with us, Dr Castro.” He reluctantly agreed to join us “for a quarter of an hour”.

At the nearby Club 21, Castro sat with the three of us for over two hours – something of a scoop for us, though he gave little away. At one point he said: “Señora Bland, you have a little boy, yes? Does he receive his milk ration?” Olivia told him: “Actually, no.” Shortly afterwards our son got his regular milk.

Two months later, the missile crisis blew up. I drove past a Soviet missile site taking photos of sinister 60-foot-long cylinders under tarpaulins, then was chased off by the secret police, the G2.

Two days later they arrested me and took me to G2 headquarters. Reuters gallantly interceded directly with Castro, so I spent only six days in jail and was deported, very conveniently, to Jamaica, where my wife had recently given birth to our second son. The guards’ treatment was cold but civil; I heard no stories of torture or beatings.

• Richard Gott (Obituary, 28 November) is right to say that Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir were boundless in their admiration for Fidel Castro, at least to begin with, and the two were guests of the revolution from 22 February to 21 March 1960. But in 1971, in part because of the imprisonment of the Cuban poet Heberto Padilla, both severed links with Castro and the Cuban regime. Sartre died in 1980 and Beauvoir in 1986, and did not return to the Castro fold.

• Richard Gott does not explain how Fidel Castro managed to retain power for over half a century. He could have mentioned the Committees for the Defence of the Revolution (CDR), set up to spy on the Cuban populace and identify potential dissidents. Each adult Cuban was expected to belong to the local CDR, which was in turn required to keep a file on each of its members. The CDR network was organised with the friendly assistance of the East German Stasi, and based on the system operating in East Germany. The latter was merely a refinement of the Blockleiter system set up in 1935 to control the population of Nazi Germany. Interestingly, the regimes in Nazi Germany, East Germany and Cuba all believed in elections with only one candidate for each seat, and in securing massive voter turnout. Hitler, Honecker, Castro: it really does seem that great minds think alike.

• If the people of St Vincent want to honour the memory of Fidel Castro, surely it is appropriate for the representative of their monarchy to respect their wishes without interference from the British (‘Awkward moment’ for Prince Harry in minute’s silence for Fidel Castro, theguardian.com, 27 November). The attitude of many in Britain has more than a whiff of colonialism.

• Zoe Williams’ usually excellent judgment has let her down when she says of Fidel Castro that “What matters is that he was a dictator”, because she forgets the context of a Latin America in the 1950s dominated by rightwing despots, with every effort to replace them with progressive governments being ended by military force. This would continue well into the 1980s, and even in the last decade we have seen two elected, progressive leaders fall to rightwing coups.

How does she think a peaceful transformation from revolution to democracy should be secured? Here in Nicaragua, the 1979 revolution was followed by an election in 1984 which was not recognised by the US because it gave the “wrong” result. It was not until 1990, when the electorate correctly chose capitalism, that the US accepted the ballot as valid. It then took 16 years to restore a left-of-centre government, which is now again under threat of US sanctions.

Nowhere in Latin America has suffered the baleful influence of US intervention more than Cuba, for reasons of history and geography. The Batista regime was one of the most barbarous in the continent, with its corruption accentuated by the mafia’s control of Havana’s main businesses, yet it was unflinchingly supported by successive US governments. Castro had to defend the revolution’s achievements against the threats both of the US government itself and of the Miami-based terrorist groups who bombed Cuban planes and hotels with impunity, well into the 1990s. Nor has any other country so dependent on US commerce seen its economy strangled by a 50-year embargo, which applies not to just to US firms but to any firm that trades with the US.

What was Castro supposed to do, meekly hold elections on terms acceptable to the US, in which millions of dollars would have poured into the country to ensure the “right” result? And then see Cuba return to the oligarchs who still control countries like Honduras and Guatemala? He was well aware that even the mildest leftwing government wouldn’t have been acceptable to the US in a country only 100 miles from its borders. By not acknowledging that, Zoe, you ignore 60 years of US intervention in Central America and the Caribbean.

• Reference is rightly made to the fine role Cuba played in supporting opposition to apartheid and also in support of liberation struggles in Angola and Mozambique. I’ve not seen comment on Cuba’s support for Mengistu Haile Mariam when Ethiopia was invaded by the Somali forces of Siad Barre. What is the judgment? Mengistu eventually ousted (to sanctuary in Zimbabwe), Siad forced out and dead; Somalia in a very sorry state and Ethiopia again in some turmoil after a period of relative contentment.

• Like Zoe Williams, I too was in Cuba in the 90s. In 1993 I returned for the first time since 1960 when, during the euphoric early days of the revolution, I spent two months with an international work brigade on the construction of a rural residential school. By contrast, 1993 was a truly terrible year for Cuba. Most supposedly informed observers confidently predicted the imminent collapse of the economy and thought that Cuba would follow the USSR and the eastern European states into oblivion.

It is inexcusable to deplore the conditions of extreme hardship endured by the Cuban people without referring to their causes. On top of the US economic blockade of Cuba – which was accurately described by Noam Chomsky as the harshest in the world (harsher than the sanctions imposed on Iraq prior to the 2003 invasion), and which in 1993 had already been in place for 33 years – in 1992 Cuba also had to contend with the collapse of the Soviet Union and the overnight loss of 75% of its foreign trade. No other country has had to endure an economic calamity of such proportions. To not only have survived but to have provided its people with a free education and public health system renowned throughout the world for their excellence is an achievement without parallel.

There is nothing comparable to the 57-year-old relentless, punitive hostility with which the greatest superpower has treated a small, poor third-world country.

• I didn’t recognise Zoe Williams’ caricature of Cuba under Fidel Castro. Yes, Havana may look a little dowdy – but what a relief not to be bombarded with advertising, and the painstaking, carefully planned restoration of the old city (hardly likely under capitalism) has earned it Unesco world heritage site status.

If Zoe Williams had ventured a little away from the modestly stocked shops – unsurprising given the devastating US economic boycott, which has also depleted the “elegantly appointed” pharmacies she mocks – she would have found a vibrant musical and cultural life savoured by the Cuban people.

It’s true that prostitution – virtually eliminated prior to the fall of Soviet communism – made a comeback with the need to promote international tourism. But given a choice between a country that values every one of its citizens and nurtures their abilities, and one where food banks and beggars on street corners are in danger of becoming the norm, is there really any contest?

• We have just returned from Cuba, which we have visited regularly over the last 20 years, and we don’t recognise the country described by Zoe Williams and by the media generally. Cuba is a third-world country because it has been hammered by over 50 years of the illegal US blockade. Nor do we recognise the label of dictator. Cuba has a democracy. Members of its government do not need to be wealthy. They are farmers and shopkeepers; doctors and taxi drivers. In other words, they are citizens selected and elected by their peers. They choose their ministers, who then choose their leader. This is a very different model of democracy to ours. There are no political parties and no political campaigns. Compare that with the US, where $2.6bn was spent, resulting in the election of Donald Trump!

Castro walked the streets of Havana safely despite over 500 attempts on his life by the CIA. He is revered by his people – even the BBC in a report on Sunday acknowledged that the young people in Cuba think favourably of him. Perhaps Cuba’s achievements in the fields of free education and healthcare have some bearing on this. This so-called dictator lived in a relatively humble home on the outskirts of Havana and sought no financial gain for himself, only a better life for his fellow citizens.

Castro challenged the western world, and that is why it despised him and why the western media portrayed him in the way that they did. The pity is that so many people believe that Cuba has been, and is being, oppressed by its leaders. Our visit this month confirmed our belief that in Cuba, despite the hardships that the people have to endure, the majority of the population are cheerful, friendly and content with the egalitarian system that Castro introduced.

• The Castro apologism from many on your letters page (28 November) is shameful. We can discuss US politics, blockades, education, literacy and socialism all we want, but we would be missing the point. It is painfully ironic that those who claim to be progressive are so willing to throw these aims out the window when it comes to brutal dictators who oppress and murder anyone who thinks differently to them. Perhaps it tells us what the left’s true aims are. Not equality for all but a vicious hatred of the United States. If standing against the US means throwing gay rights under the bus, then so be it. If standing against the US means throwing religious freedom under the bus, then so be it. If standing against the US means supporting a vicious, brutal, uncompromising, murderous dictator then, it seems, so be it.

It is about time the left took a long hard look at themselves. The moral hypocrisy and arrogance is breathtaking and disgraceful. I am ashamed and they should be too.

The White House has repudiated Donald Trump’s assertion that protesters who burn the American flag should potentially be imprisoned or stripped of their citizenship.

The president-elect tweeted early on Tuesday: “Nobody should be allowed to burn the American flag – if they do, there must be consequences – perhaps loss of citizenship or year in jail!”

It was unclear what had triggered the comment, but it appeared to coincide with a report on the Fox News channel about students at a college in Massachusetts allegedly burning a flag in protest at his shock election win. Trump is known to be an avid consumer of cable TV news.

Josh Earnest, the White House spokesman, told reporters that freedom of expression was enshrined in the US constitution. “The need to protect those rights is in place to protect speech and expression not just when we agree with it but also when we find it offensive,” he said.

“Many Americans – the vast majority of Americans, myself included – find the burning of the flag offensive but we have a responsibility as a country to carefully protect our rights that are enshrined in the constitution.”

Earnest added: “This is a bipartisan sentiment. I know that there are conservatives on the supreme court that share the view that I’ve just articulated. I know that there are Democrats and Republicans in the United States Congress that share the view I’ve just articulated, and it certainly is consistent with the kind of governing agenda that President Obama has pursued here in the White House during his eight years in the Oval Office.”

Asked if the president, who has spoken to Trump by phone more than once since the election, was concerned about such views, Earnest replied: “This is not the first thing that the president-elect has said or tweeted that President Obama disagrees with.”

Freedom of speech extended to Twitter, he said, “so there’s a little irony in this situation”.

The supreme court ruled in 1989 that flag-burning is “expressive conduct” protected by the first amendment. Among those voting with the court majority in the Texas v Johnson case was the late justice Antonin Scalia, for whom Trump has regularly expressed admiration.

Asked about Trump’s comments, Mitch McConnell, the Republican Senate majority leader, said he supported the supreme court’s decision.



“The supreme court has held that that activity is a protected first amendment right, a form of unpleasant speech,” McConnell told reporters on Capitol Hill. 



“In this country we have a long tradition of respecting unpleasant speech.”

Joe Manchin, a Democratic senator from West Virginia, also agreed that flag-burning was a constitutional right.

But he added: “If you do it in front of me, I’m going to beat the hell out of you.”

Trump’s proposal was also condemned as unconstitutional on another count. In a 1967 case, Afroyim v Rusk, the supreme court ruled that the constitution does not allow the government to take away an individual’s citizenship against their will.

Shane Kadidal, a senior managing attorney at the Center for Constitutional Rights, said: “There are two baseline constitutional tenets that he manages to screw up in 140 characters.”



Scalia was among the judges in the case that established that flag burning is “constitutionally protected speech”, Kadidal added, while “it’s even more established, by half a century, that one can only lose one’s citizenship by voluntary means”.

Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond, said: “The supreme court has spoken in the flag-burning case. The constitutionality of that is pretty settled. The law is clear and has been for some time.

“Burning the flag is widely seen as a social taboo but not a legal one. It’s a freedom we’ve had for 200 years and it had to trump the other interests, no matter how vile we might think that activity is. Justice Scalia thought the constitution had to be paramount.”

Trump has previously been accused of showing little respect for the US constitution. Khizr Khan, a Muslim whose son was killed while serving in Iraq, memorably questioned at the Democratic national convention whether the celebrity businessman had even read it.

On Tuesday, there was also criticism from Trump’s own party. David Frum, a former speechwriter for President George W Bush and now a senior editor of the Atlantic, tweeted: “If flag-burning merits loss of citizenship, what should be the penalty for a Nazi salute by a Trump supporter?”

He also posted: “Donald Trump’s political career is one protracted flag burning. The symbols of the Republic properly belong to his opponents.”

Congressman Sean Duffy, a Republican from Wisconsin, told CNN: “We want to protect those people who want to protest … I disagree with Mr Trump on that.”

Trump would not be the first president to attempt a ban on flag burning. The Flag Protection Act of 1989 was supported by George HW Bush before it was ruled unconstitutional, and the Flag Protection Act of 2005, another failed attempt to criminalise flag burning, was co-sponsored by then senator Hillary Clinton.

The latter effort was also supported by Harry Reid, now the outgoing Senate Democratic leader. Reid said on Tuesday his vote was not equivalent to what Trump was suggesting.



“We know Trump tweeted that he feels that someone who burns a flag should lose their citizenship,” the Nevada Democrat told reporters in his weekly press conference on Capitol Hill. “I don’t agree with him; he’s gone way too far.”



Arizona senator John McCain said he also disapproved of burning the flag but declined to address Trump’s specific claim that people who do so should lose their citizenship.



“I think there should be some punishment, but right now the supreme court decision is that people are free to express themselves that way,” McCain told CNN.

“There’s other ways for people to express their views rather than to burn a flag that so many fought and died for.”

The 2008 Republican presidential nominee grew testy, however, when pressed further on Trump’s views.



“I’m not commenting on Mr Trump’s comments,” McCain said. “I have not and will not.”

“That may be your priority, to comment every day on any comment that Mr Trump has,” he added of reporters. “My priority is to try to defend the nation and the men and women who are serving it.”

Not for the first time, the president-elect’s Twitter habits deflected attention from transition business, although that too is being played out in an unusually public manner. He has now held 68 meetings with potential administration members, transition spokesperson Sean Spicer said.

On Tuesday, Trump named representative Tom Price as health secretary and, according to reports, planned to name Elaine Chao as transportation secretary.

Chao, who was labour secretary under Bush, is married to McConnell. She was also a member of Trump’s Asian Pacific American Advisory Council during his presidential campaign.



Price, an orthopaedic surgeon from Georgia, has spent more than a decade in Congress and influenced the healthcare plan that the House speaker, Paul Ryan, is pushing as an alternative to Barack Obama’s signature Affordable Care Act. Price is also a fierce opponent of abortion rights and described the legalisation of gay marriage as “a sad day for marriage”.

For Democrats it was yet another ominously rightwing appointment. The incoming Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, said Price “has proven to be far out of the mainstream of what Americans want when it comes to Medicare, the Affordable Care Act, and Planned Parenthood”.

Schumer said those programmes have helped millions of Americans, including “seniors, families, people with disabilities and women, have access to quality, affordable healthcare. Nominating Congressman Price to be the HHS [health and human services] secretary is akin to asking the fox to guard the hen house.”

The House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi, said: “If Tom Price has his way with the Affordable Care Act, millions of families who have finally found affordable coverage for themselves and their children will be pushed back into the cold. Doctors would be hounded out of lifesaving research, and women would be denied their right to contraception and comprehensive healthcare.”

Trump was due to have dinner on Tuesday night with Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee for president in 2012 and a former foe who is now in contention for the position of secretary of state. The president-elect will begin a “thank you tour” on Thursday night with a rally in Cincinnati, Ohio.

Victims of abuse are finding it increasingly difficult to bring claims for compensation to court because of cuts to legal aid and high legal fees, the inquiry into child sexual abuse has heard.



In its first public seminar, the independent inquiry chaired by Prof Alexis Jay was also told that proposals to introduce a fixed costs regime could add a further barrier to justice.

Luke Daniels, a solicitor with the firm Irwin Mitchell, said it now costs £10,000 to issue a claim. Some cases were later dropped because the costs involved were deemed by the Legal Aid Agency to be disproportionate to any likely future award. 



Peter Garsden, a solicitor with Simpson Millar and president of the Association of Child Abuse Lawyers, said legal aid had been cut back heavily. “People who go through abuse cases are generally unable to work,” he said, “and from the lower income thresholds. 



“There’s a poverty gap where you can’t afford civil litigation but don’t qualify for public funding. The equity in your house is taken into account [in testing entitlement to legal aid].

Garsden added: “Persuading the Legal Aid Agency that your case has merit is a huge amount of work. The special cases unit in Brighton require you to prove everything and take nothing on trust. Some [lawyers] don’t deal with legal aid because it requires so much effort.”

Jonathan Bridge, a solicitor with the law firm Farleys in Manchester, said: “There are an increasingly large number of experts who will not work at legal aid rates. They will not prepare reports at legal aid rates. That’s particularly a problem with adult and child psychiatrists.”

Dave Enright, of the solicitors firm Howe and Co in London, said there was consequently “a very small pool of practitioners”. He said: “It’s badly paid. The work is so complex and that’s part of the barrier.”

Asked by counsel to the inquiry Peter Skelton QC whether that prevented access to justice, Enright replied: “Absolutely. Because there will be huge [advice] deserts around the country.” Large parts of the country did not have local lawyers who are experts on abuse.

“There’s a chilling effect. The people who come to us are the tip of the iceberg. The overwhelming majority never come forward. They suffer from the chilling effect of these changes in legal funding by which they have to make financial judgments about whether or not to take cases forward.”

Most claims for abuse are settled for relatively modest sums, according to evidence from solicitors who specialise in sexual abuse cases. Richard Scorer, of the law firm Slater and Gordon, said: “Average awards are around £15,000, typically in the £10,000 to £40,000 range. 



“Big figure awards are very unusual. There’s a difficulty in proving loss of earnings. It’s usually a modest award for disadvantage in the labour market. The highest awards have been £600,000 to £700,000.”

The oldest case of abuse Scorer said he had reached a settlement on dated back to 1955. Because of rules on limitations, he added, few were likely to succeed much before that date.

Garsden said 80% of abuse involves someone already known to the victim. “Those are non-institutional cases,” he said. “They are deserving but can you pursue them?”

Cases against institutions mostly date from the 1960s to the mid-1980s before foster care became more common. “What all survivors of abuse want is their day in court and to be believed and to be listened to,” Garsden said.



A further threat to litigation, the solicitors explained, is a new regime of fixed costs for all claims. Lord Justice Jackson has been commissioned to undertake a review of fixed recoverable costs, to be completed by July 2017. “Fixed cost regimes would render most of these cases unviable,” Garsden added.

Experts from the insurance world also gave evidence. They denied that new policies were being produced that included exclusion clauses for claims involving sexual molestation.

One insurer insisted that his company would never suggest there had ever been consent to sexual offences by those aged under 16. The seminar was told, however, that the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority had in one unusual case considered a 14-year-old to have consented.

An injured police officer whose wife wants doctors to withdraw life support treatment has shown some signs of improvement, a court has heard.

But the court of protection hearing in Manchester heard that PC Paul Briggs, 43, remained in a minimally conscious state and was still unable to consistently respond to yes or no questions using a buzzer.

Briggs, whose wife, Lindsey, has asked the court to stop his treatment, sustained a brain haemorrhage, five fractures in his spine, bruising to internal organs and several other severe injuries in a crash in July last year.

The Gulf war veteran, from Wirral, Merseyside, is being cared for at the Walton Centre in Liverpool.

Specialist speech and language therapist Mary Ankers told the court there was still potential for Briggs to emerge from the minimally conscious state.

She said: “His responses in terms of command following ... have certainly become more consistent.”

The court heard staff would give Briggs a buzzer and ask him to press it, before moving on to ask him questions which he could respond to by pressing the buzzer once for yes or twice for no.

Ankers said in 47 out of 64 sessions he had been able to respond to commands from staff at least once, which she said was an improvement on an assessment earlier this year.

But she said his response to higher-level tasks was “highly inconsistent”.

The judge, Mr Justice Charles, questioned whether one of the assessments, which had reported Briggs had responded to a number of questions using the buzzer, was “dodgy” as it did not follow the proper process.

Ankers agreed the results of that session should be treated with great caution.

The report showed Briggs had used the buzzer to answer a number of questions about himself and indicated yes when asked if he was in pain.

The frozen food retailer Iceland is sending a “high-level delegation” to Reykjavik this week in an attempt to thaw relations with the Icelandic government after it launched legal action against the chain over the use of its name.

Iceland Foods is urgently seeking a meeting with Iceland’s foreign ministry to set out “constructive proposals” that could help break the deadlock and resume a longstanding “peaceful coexistence” that it says has prevailed for nearly half a century.

Iceland is challenging Iceland Foods’ exclusive ownership of the European-wide trademark registration for the word Iceland, which it says is preventing the country’s companies from promoting goods and services abroad.

The Icelandic government claims the supermarket has “aggressively pursued” and won multiple cases against companies that use the word Iceland as part of its trademark, “even in cases when the products and services do not compete”.

The supermarket’s founder and chief executive, Malcolm Walker, said on Tuesday: “A high-level delegation from Iceland [Foods] is preparing to fly to Reykjavik this week to begin negotiations, and we very much hope for a positive response and an early resolution of this issue.”

The retailer’s company secretary and legal director, Duncan Vaughan, will be leading the delegation in the next few days, but it will not include Walker.

Walker said: “We registered Iceland as our company name in 1970 and we have coexisted with the country called Iceland very happily ever since. They have made no contact with us to raise any concerns about trademark issues since 2012.

“We have no desire whatsoever to stand in the way of Iceland the country making use of their own name to promote their own products, so long as it does not conflict or cause confusion with our own business. I am sure there is ample scope for an agreement that will allow both parties to continue to live and work amicably alongside each other.”

The company, whose headquarters are in Deeside, has more than 800 stores in the UK and employs more than 23,000 staff. It holds a Europe-wide trademark registration for the word, and Iceland the country is seeking to invalidate the registration on the basis that it is “exceptionally broad and ambiguous in definition, often rendering the country’s firms unable to describe their products as Icelandic”.

In a circular released last week, the government stated: “The government of Iceland is concerned that our country’s businesses are unable to promote themselves across Europe in association with their place of origin – a place of which we are rightly proud and enjoys a very positive national branding.”

In an explanatory statement, the retailer added that it did not simply take its name from the Nordic state, but has a long history of close and friendly involvement with the country.

“For seven years from 2005, Iceland Foods was under the control of Icelandic investors and later Icelandic banks. This relationship came to an end with the £1.5bn management buyout of the company in 2012, but Iceland the company has continued to have a warm relationship with Iceland the country through the ownership of three Iceland stores there, export sales of Iceland products to other retailers throughout the country, and sponsorship of the Icelandic national team in this year’s European football championships.”



The retailer claimed “the closeness and friendliness of relations” was underlined when Walker welcomed then Icelandic prime minister, Halldór Ásgrimsson, on an official visit to Iceland’s Fulham Road store in south-west London in 2006.

Magistrates are resigning in “considerable” numbers, the head of their national body has said, after scores of court closures and swingeing government cuts.

Forty-seven magistrates courts have shut this year, one-tenth of courts in England and Wales, with significant numbers of judges resigning early from the unpaid position.

Malcolm Richardson, the chairman of the Magistrates Association, said: “Magistrates deal with more than 90% of the criminal cases that come to court and they cost 1% of the HM Courts and Tribunal Service budget. But we’re getting a bit tired of being treated like the 1% and not the 90%.”



The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) would not disclose the number of magistrates who had resigned this year, but the association said the figure was considerable.

It comes after at least 75 magistrates resigned last year over the controversial criminal courts charge, which caused outrage among law groups before it was scrapped by Michael Gove.

The mass resignations and court closures have left the magistracy stretched, Richardson said, adding that “nobody [in government] seems to have a plan” for the future of the volunteer judges.

“There is no evidence of a strategy for the use of magistrates. What are we for the in 21st century? What are we for in the brave new world, which is starting to be revealed under the courts reform programme?” he said.

“Magistrates feel they are not, and have not been, engaged with in the determination of what that future looks like … The consequences of that for some magistrates, particularly those who are getting towards retirement, is to say ‘why am I carrying on?’ It’s a difficult question to answer.”

Three magistrates who have resigned or retired since September told the Guardian morale was at rock bottom among the judges, who are only paid expenses.

They said magistrates felt ignored and unappreciated as a result of cost cutting, ranging from court closures to buildings falling into disrepair. More trivial money-saving measures, such as cutting back on coffee and newspapers in the judges’ quarters, and using cheaper, thinner paper, had also irritated the magistracy, they said.

Janet Alcock, a Conservative councillor in Clitheroe, Lancashire, said she “resigned in despair” in September after 20 years as a magistrate. The role has been reduced to a “soul-destroying production line” of speeding fines and licence fee evasions, Alcock said, adding that she gave up encouraging people to become magistrates a long time ago.

Alcock said she had become “extremely frustrated” at having to issue fines to defendants who would never be able to pay, and the victim surcharge, which “just seems to be another way of dressing up that they’re taking more money off them”.

“You know, realistically, from the point of view of collecting the fines, you’re not going to get it, which makes it extremely frustrating,” she said. “Everybody’s always calling me ‘the hanging judge’ because I’m saying things like instead of fining people who can’t afford it, send them out working … Political correctness wouldn’t allow you to do anything like that.

“But that would be far more satisfying to the public, I think, than for people to appear six months later owing even more than they did at the beginning. It’s just frustrating for everybody.”

Myra Robinson, who retired last month as a bench chairman of Newcastle magistrates, said fining those who could not afford to pay was morally wrong, but there was little that magistrates could do about it. “It’s just ticking boxes and following down – if someone did this then that’s the punishment. There’s no flexibility,” she said.

“I’d worked all my career with young offenders and kids with problems. I felt I knew a lot of the families with problems in Newcastle, and I could see behind what they’d just done and think what would be an appropriate way of dealing with it. My hands have been tied for many years now. People can’t afford fines.”

A third recently resigned magistrate, who did not want to be named, said the court closures meant “losing local justice for local people”. In some cases, proposed closures meant it would be impossible for defendants or witnesses travelling by public transport to get to a court for 10am.

“I was constantly getting emails or texts or phone calls to say that we urgently need magistrates to sit in places like Scarborough. That would imply there is a shortage,” said the magistrate, who was based nearly 90 miles (145km) away in Halifax, west Yorkshire.

Forty-seven magistrates courts closed their doors between March and September under government proposals to reduce the £500m annual cost of the courts estate. A further 45 are due to shut by September 2017, meaning one-fifth of all courts in England and Wales will have disappeared in 19 months.

An MoJ spokeswoman said: “The magistracy remains at the heart of our justice system. We are investing £1bn to reform and digitise our courts to deliver swifter justice, and we are working closely with the judiciary to encourage the recruitment of underrepresented groups.

“Closing underused and dilapidated court buildings will allow us to reinvest in the justice system and make the best use of technology, improving the experience for all court users, in particular vulnerable victims and witnesses.”

With Nigeria’s parliament poised to extend a controversial law banning the “menace of street begging” throughout the country, campaigners are warning the policy has already resulted in the persecution of tens of thousands of disabled and mentally ill citizens.

Street begging is illegal in Lagos, Nigeria’s most populous city, and carries fines of around N15,000 (£38) and up to three months’ imprisonment. Those who fail to pay the fine are incarcerated until they are able to pay up.

But due to poor medical support, the people begging on Lagos’s street are disproportionately made up of mentally ill and disabled citizens, and human rights activists say tens of thousands of vulnerable people have been detained over the past five years as a result of the ban.

Megan Chapman, a human rights lawyer and director of the local NGO Justice and Empowerment Initiatives (JEI), said the “scale of human rights violations is massive and extremely concerning”, and added the treatment may be illegal under the country’s constitution.

Though campaigners from JEI acknowledged that begging is also banned in other cities across the world, they claim the ban is policed brutally and without transparency in Lagos. “It’s hard to find a city enforcing the ban in as inhumane a way as Lagos is,” Chapman said.

Despite widespread calls from NGOs and activists for the state to reconsider its policy, the Nigerian senate is now considering a bill to ban begging nationwide.

The bill, proposed by Senator Isah Misau, has substantial backing in the senate, with lawmakers claiming the increase in begging is caused by criminal exploitation rather than poor economic conditions in Nigeria, which is now officially in recession.

Speaking in support of the proposed legislation, Misau said: “Street begging affects not only the geographical and social structure of urban areas; it also portrays the country in a bad light to tourists and foreign visitors.”



Lagos state’s governor, Akinwunmi Ambode, has backed the crackdown on street begging. “We’ve had security reports on the activities of persons who pose as beggars, especially in traffic, but their sole aim is to perpetrate evil,” he said in July.

The state government said in April that 1,340 beggars, destitute and “mentally challenged persons” had been “rescued” from the streets of Lagos in the past year. During this period, it said 590 “rehabilitees” had been released and reunited with their relatives for re-integration, while 1,228 people were rehabilitated at what it referred to as a “rehabilitation and training centre” in Majidun, on mainland Lagos.

In addition, according to a leaked memo cited on the Nigerian site PM News, 413 beggars and “lunatics” were reportedly evacuated from Lagos’s streets by government officials between March and July this year.

Most of those detained for begging are taken to the holding facility by the so-called “rescue team” from the Lagos State Youth and Development Ministry, which enforces the ban.

The centre was opened as part of a drive to clean up the city in the 1970s. State officials claim it is used to help and treat beggars and people who are physically or mentally ill, yet reports from former detainees paint a different picture.

Men and women held there have described torturous conditions, claiming to have been denied basic rights and medical attention, held in confined spaces, often for years, without a fair hearing.

“We have met dozens of people arrested for begging who have been made to pay a hefty bribe, who have been deprived of their liberty for months or even years. Not one of them has ever been taken before a court of law. It is a serious violation of their rights under the Nigerian constitution,” she said.

“What we’ve been pressing the state government to do is to have a root and branch overhaul of the system; stop the mass incarcerations that impact on the health and well-being of the beggars.”

Workers from JEI, along with the Physically Challenged Empowerment Initiative (PCEI), a grassroots organisation campaigning against the detentions, have looked after several people after their release from the centre.

Among them was 25-year-old Yakubu Idris. After his arrest and 20-month detention at the Majidun facility, his health deteriorated. Interviewed hours after his release, he said: “Now I cannot walk – I cannot even stand up from the floor.”

Despite suffering from extensive infections and a respiratory problem, Idris said he was denied medical treatment by officials at the facility. “In the cell I totally forgot how long I was there because I was never let out. Then one day theoga [boss] took two of us and released us,” he said.

A week later, tests for tuberculosis came back positive, but Idris died before he could receive treatment.

Chapman said calls for change by local NGOs were slowly being heeded, but the proposed bill threatened to undermine years of work to change attitudes towards beggars.

“We have pointed out that current practices are completely unconstitutional and fail to address the social problems of destitution and street begging. The focus should be on helping the poor and people living with disabilities to find alternative livelihoods,” she said.

Under the previous Lagos state governor, scores of beggars were routinely deported to their states of origin. In 2011, 3,029 people were deported from Lagos. Dolapo Badru, a state government spokesman at the time, defended the measures, arguing that “beggars and destitutes constitute a social nuisance towards the development of Lagos as a mega-city”.

Muhammed Zanna, one of the founders of the PCEI in Lagos said negative perceptions of the poor had led to widespread apathy about the way they are treated by the state.

“Governor Ambode wants to create a modern city and the poor don’t fit into that vision,” said Zanna.

“The state doesn’t see beggars as real people, just as people to hide or to send away. People who have no interaction with the poor or disabled have this idea that they are really criminals and drug dealers, so even when the state services maltreats them people don’t show any concern,” Zanna said.

State officials at the youth ministry did not respond to requests for comment.

Officials at the facility in Majidun denied detainees were kept in harsh conditions indefinitely or denied basic rights, and claimed a doctor was available to provide treatment. They also say it is merely “a temporary holding site” until fines are paid or a hearing takes place.

Forty-year-old Binta Muhammadu was arrested in February with her two children, aged two and four. When she couldn’t pay the fine, she was detained at Majidun for nine months, with her children held elsewhere. “In that time I only saw my children three times,” she said.

According to Binta, “there were about 50 of us in the same room, where we bathed, ate and slept. We were never let out,” she said.

“I don’t know what I will do now that I am free,” she added. “I don’t have anything and I can’t walk well any more. This has just made things worse for me than it was before.”

At the heart of the latest allegations swirling around George Brandis, the chronically dysfunctional first law officer, is the claim that he failed in his duty to protect the constitution and the revenue in order to perform a favour to political soulmates in the government of Western Australia.

That was what the West Australian newspaper said on Friday, in a useful article that tied together some of the loose strands still flapping in the wake of Brandis’ entanglement with the former solicitor general, Justin Gleeson.

If the allegation is true then it would be unconscionable for Brandis to remain attorney general.

It was asserted by the paper that Brandis instructed the solicitor general not to run an argument in the high court on behalf of the commissioner of taxation that would jeopardise legislation passed by the Western Australian parliament to close down the long-running Bell litigation, where creditors were fighting over the carve-up of assets from the carcass of Alan Bond’s corporate interests.

Instead of lawyers in court scrapping over money, the WA government wanted to take control and arrange its own scheme of distribution. This was of immediate concern to the commissioner of taxation, who was in line for $300m in unpaid Bell taxes and concerned that he would be at the mercy of bureaucrats in Perth.

The Bell Act sought to alter, impair and detract from the commonwealth’s ability to enforce the recovery of a tax debt.

Gleeson thought it was constitutional law 101 that the WA legislation ran foul of the conflict of laws provision of the constitution.

The Taxation Commission sought the solicitor general’s advice and was told there was an excellent chance the high court would find what the law men from the wild west had done was invalid, which it duly found in May this year.

Brandis made a statement to the Senate on Monday, where for all the world he looked like a man whose career was balanced on eggshells. He said it was absurd for the opposition to say that he had “failed sufficiently to protect the interests of the commonwealth”.

There are a couple of things to note about those dates. The ATO intervened in the high court case on 8 March, while Brandis only allowed the commonwealth to get its foot in the door six days before the argument kicked off in the high court on 5 April.

One possible explanation for this delay was that the attorney general was trying to keep faith with the Western Australian Liberals, by at least staying the commonwealth’s hand, even though the ATO had independently decided to press ahead.

It was only when Gleeson came to see the attorney general sometime before 30 March, to insist that the commonwealth should intervene in the litigation that the government’s senior lawyers got the green light to be involved.

Brandis has tried to suggest that the commonwealth didn’t need to get involved because the commissioner of taxation had mounted his horse.

One other thing – it doesn’t wash for him to claim that the letters between Hockey and the WA treasurer, Mike Nahan, are not evidence of an agreement between the state and federal government. If anything, Hockey’s letter gives the Western Australians a great big, gleaming green light to press ahead with their Bell legislation. All the commonwealth treasurer was concerned about was ensuring Australia is an attractive destination for foreign investment. Here’s Hockey:

We actually have to go to the high court transcripts to get further and better particulars as to what went on.

On 8 February, seven weeks before the commonwealth intervened in the litigation, there was a directions hearing in the high court.

Dr James Watson, instructed by the Australian government solicitor, appeared and told Justice Virginia Bell:

One implication of what Watson told the court on 8 February was that the AG was still to decide on something he had in contemplation – yet the Senate was told that the first that Brandis had any “personal involvement” was 3 March.

This is something that any inquiry by a Senate committee might tease out.

The alternative position is that the government solicitor was acting without the attorney general’s knowledge, which stretches incredulity when it comes to a control freak like George Brandis, particularly in a high profile piece of politically sensitive litigation.

On the same day (8 February) barrister Anthony D’Arcy appeared for the Bell plaintiffs and said that his clients wanted a special case that embraced the legislation’s inconsistencies with both the Tax Act and the Corporations Act.

In other words, while Brandis later indicated he was chewing his fingernails about whether it was preferable to engage the Tax Act argument alone, the plaintiffs seven weeks earlier were pressing for an all-in case that included the Corporations Act.

The questions that Brandis’ statement to parliament did not answer are these:

A casual observer might think that protecting the commonwealth’s interests would involve getting on the bus from day one, not three weeks after the tax office was on the case and seven weeks after the AGS lawyers told the court the AG “has not yet made the decision to intervene”.

Then there is the timing of the 4 May super-duper Legal Services Direction, which required all government agencies (including the Commissioner of Taxation) to seek the attorney general’s approval before running off and getting advice from Gleeson. The attorney issued that direction 12 days before the high court handed down its decision.

All very puzzling. No doubt Justin Gleeson could clear up the confusion if he was asked to give evidence to another performance of the legal and constitutional affairs committee.

In the meantime, the lawyers can get back to feasting on the 25-year banquet that is the Bell creditors’ litigation.

The regime at the category C Hindley jail near Wigan is “one of the worst and possibly one of the very worst that inspectors had ever seen in this type of prison”, an official watchdog report has said.

The chief inspector of prisons, Peter Clarke, said the Hindley regime includes regular shutdowns when inmates, including young adults, are locked in their cells for more than 24 hours at a time.

His report published on Tuesday also highlights poor food, including mouldy bread, filthy cells, and a high level of violence with 126 assaults in just six months, including 35 fights. Half the prisoners told inspectors it was easy to get hold of illegal drugs, which were more accessible than clean clothes, sheets or books from the library.

Peter Dawson, the director of the Prison Reform Trust, said although they were used to dreadful inspection reports about dilapidated, overcrowded Victorian prisons, HMP Hindley “is none of these things, and this damning verdict is all the more troubling as a result”.

The latest critical inspection report comes after peers in the House of Lords cited the record level of prison suicides so far this year. Justice ministers responded by acknowledging the seriousness of the crisis and highlighting their plans to recruit 2,500 more prison officers, including 400 immediately for the 10 most challenged prisons.

Hindley in Greater Manchester opened in 1961 as a borstal and in 2015 was converted from a youth jail into a category C prison for young offenders and adult males serving sentences of up to four years.

The inspection was carried out in July, when the jail held 515 inmates and was within its operational capacity.

But the inspectors found a “totally inadequate regime” in which more than two-thirds of prisoners said they received less than six hours a day out of their cells and many experienced less than that on a daily basis.

“The inadequate regime was made worse by significant slippage and regular shutdowns, which meant that most prisoners regularly experienced being locked in their cells for more than 24 hours. As a result, prisoners were often not unlocked to attend work or education, and were denied daily access to showers and telephones,” the report said.



Residential wings and landings were dirty, with inspectors finding mould and fungus, while single cells were small and poorly ventilated, and many were filthy.

“The regime at Hindley was one of the worst, and possibly the very worst, that inspectors had ever seen in this type of prison,” said Clarke. “The length of time for which young adults and adults alike were locked up was, in our considered view, unnecessary, unjustifiable and counterproductive. Almost every aspect of prison life was adversely affected by the regime.”

He cited the problem of the staff association opposing a move to put microwaves on the wings as “symptomatic of what seemed to have gone wrong at Hindley”. He said many prisoners locked up all day only received a hot meal at 4pm and were given an inadequate breakfast pack to see them through to lunchtime the next day. A move to install microwaves would have been an improvement but “good intentions were not being translated into action on the wings”.

He added: “To make progress, there needs to be a very clear recognition of what is good at Hindley, and also where there needs to be fundamental change. Many examples of good practice could be found in the chaplaincy, education and healthcare. The same could not be said for residential areas. There needs to be an honest appraisal of the culture that predominates among some staff in these areas.”



Michael Spurr, the chief executive of the National Offender Management Service, said since the inspection a detailed improvement plan had been developed to address the weaknesses identified by inspectors.

“Progress has been made to improve safety and purposeful activity with more prisoners engaged in high-quality work and training opportunities,” said Spurr.



“Additional staff have been transferred into the prison to support the improvements required and the governor is working closely with Greater Manchester police to tackle gang behaviour and violence in the prison.”

For the past four months, Turkey’s leader has subjected his country to sweeping political purges – but there are few signs of an end soon. The new announcement that 6,000 teachers will be reinstated in their jobs after having been suspended is a welcome gesture but does little to reduce the level of tension.

Since the mid-July failed coup attempt against Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s regime, the president has orchestrated what amounts to a counter-coup. What Mr Erdoğan sees as a clean-up of the Turkish body politic looks like the biggest purge in Turkey’s modern history. More than 125,000 people have been dismissed or suspended and around 40,000 others arrested. Amnesty says there are “credible reports” of detainees being subjected to “beatings and torture, including rape”. Judges, military personnel and professors have lost their jobs.

While democracy should not have been usurped by the military, there are justifiable concerns about where Mr Erdoğan is going. A state of emergency allows him to rule by decree. Those affected are opponents of the ruling AK party. Kurdish activist groups and people suspected of links to the Fetullah Gülen network find themselves bracketed with Isis militants. Media freedom has been dramatically crushed. On 12 November the executive director of the pro-democracy newspaper Cumhuriyet was detained. Nine of its journalists had already been arrested.

Turkey’s western allies are alarmed, but against a complex geopolitical backdrop, they have chosen discretion rather than valour. After the EU parliament last week voted to freeze EU accession talks with Turkey, Mr Erdoğan lashed out by threatening to open the country’s borders to migrants heading to Europe. This is tantamount to blackmail. If the president made good it would collapse the EU-Turkey deal negotiated by Angela Merkel which saw Ankara agree to take back refugees in exchange for billions in aid, ease travel restrictions for Turks and refresh EU membership talks. The hope in European capitals is that Mr Erdoğan will not want to destroy the agreement: visa-free travel to Europe remains a popular prospect for Turks.

By fanning nationalist sentiment, Mr Erdoğan wants to reach his long-held goal of changing the Turkish constitution in a way that would enlarge and concentrate powers in the presidency. One proposal would see Mr Erdogan in office until 2029. But both the EU and Turkey’s strongman appear to suffer from a bout of magical thinking. There is currently no consensus in Europe for further rapprochement with a regime whose authoritarianism is blatantly on the rise. Nor is Mr Erdoğan ready to abandon the leverage he publicly claims to have with European governments. The lifting of visas hinges on Turkey rescinding the anti-terrorism legislation, which Mr Erdoğan uses to repress dissent – and he shows no appetite of giving up. An October deadline came and went, with no progress whatsoever.

No one, whether in Brussels or Ankara, is ready to cut off talks. The stalemate plays to both sides’ interests. This might change if Mr Erdoğan reintroduces the death penalty, as he has threatened to: the EU has said this would end accession talks. Meanwhile, the grinding machine of political repression continues in Turkey, whose rapprochement with Vladimir Putin’s Russia has become a stark new feature of its foreign policy – with western allies left to contemplate their lack of sway.

Harsh personal attacks on judges are bad for democracy and in danger of diminishing the independence of the judiciary, the former deputy president of the supreme court has warned.

In a forceful defence of the court’s justices ahead of next week’s pivotal article 50 appeal hearing, Lord Hope, who retired in 2013, said recent attacks had gone far beyond legitimate criticism. 



He revealed that a scheduled speech about the law and Europe by a supreme justice, Lord Mance, had to be cancelled because of heightened political sensitivity over the European Union and Brexit.



His comments come in the wake of a Daily Mail front page that branded the three high court judges who decided the article 50 case “enemies of the people” and media attacks on the supreme court president, Lord Neuberger, and the deputy president, Lady Hale.

“Things have been happening which have made the lives of those wishing to come into the judiciary much less [free],” Hope told a meeting hosted by the centre right thinktank Policy Exchange. “We run the risk of a diminished judiciary as a result. Recently the criticism has been taken too far and [there have been] harsh personal attacks.”

Hope said he had suffered from “wounding” personal attacks in the past. “It’s bad for democracy,” he added. “Every lecture given by members of the supreme court and [even] sentences are being taken out of context.

“Supreme court judges do give and publish lectures as part of their public [role]. This [excessive criticism] runs the risk of closing things down. At least one lecture [Lord Mance’s] was taken out in case it excites that sort of comment.”



The supreme court will next week hear the appeal by the government against the high court ruling that only parliament, as opposed to ministers, has the authority to trigger article 50 of the treaty on the European Union, which will formally start the UK’s withdrawal from the EU. 



In recognition of the unprecedented case’s constitutional importance, 11 supreme court justices will hear the arguments.



Addressing the Policy Exchange meeting, the former editor of the Daily Telegraph, Charles Moore, called on Neuberger and Hale to “recuse” themselves and stand down from the bench because of their alleged impartiality.

He accused Hale of giving a detailed speech on the issues in the article 50 case before hearing it and of introducing new questions about potential parliamentary procedure which had not been discussed in the high court case. Moore also said pro-European tweets by Neuberger’s wife constituted political activity.

Judges, Moore said, were traditionally considered to be the guardians of the constitution and the “lions under the throne”. Have they now become “snakes in the grass?”, he asked.

“The great majority of judges are very pro-human rights and pro-Europe,” he added. “Is there enough diversity of opinion on the supreme court? They should be independent of one another or is it group think?” 



The former home secretary and Conservative party leader, Michael Howard, accused Hale of “getting her retaliation in first” by delivering a speech ahead of the case. “It was wholly undesirable,” he said.

Although the Brexit case was not an example of judicial overreach, Lord Howard said there was evidence of a “judicial grab for power”. Since judges are “unaccountable” it would be “monstrous” if criticism of the judiciary were to be curtailed. “It’s of the utmost importance that the judiciary should not be immune from robust criticism,” he said.

Responding to attacks on the justices, a supreme court spokesperson said: “The role of the justices is to consider the points of law presented to them impartially, and to fulfil their judicial oath in reaching a decision according to the law. No evidence has been presented that would suggest any justice of the supreme court has compromised their ability to fulfil that duty.”

In statements earlier this month, the court defended Neuberger and Hale. A court spokesperson said: “Justices’ spouses are fully entitled to express personal opinions, including on issues of the day. Lady Neuberger’s passing comments on Twitter have absolutely no bearing on Lord Neuberger’s ability to determine the legal questions in this case impartially, according to the law of the land.”

In relation to Hale’s speech, a supreme court spokesperson said: “Lady Hale was simply presenting the arguments from both sides of the article 50 appeal in an impartial way for an audience of law students, as part of a wider lecture on constitutional law. It is entirely proper for serving judges to set out the arguments in high-profile cases to help public understanding of the legal issues, as long as it is done in an even-handed way.

“One of the questions raised in these proceedings is what form of legislation would be necessary for parliament to be able to lawfully trigger article 50, if the government loses its appeal. A number of politicians have raised the same question. Though it was not dealt with explicitly in the high court judgment, it is not a new issue. In no way was Lady Hale offering a view on what the likely outcome might be.”

The British government is facing a new legal challenge over whether it should seek to retain membership of the single market during the Brexit process. 



Lawyers will argue that June’s referendum asked the public a single question over whether the UK should leave the EU, and did not delve into the more complex issue of economic access.

The group British Influence will use a judicial review to suggest the government could be acting unlawfully if it uses Brexit to also leave the wider European Economic Area – through which non-EU countries such as Norway are inside the single market.

It is the second legal challenge faced by ministers over the process of leaving the EU. The government’s appeal to the recent high court ruling that only parliament has the power to formally trigger Brexit will be heard next week.

Jonathan Lis, the deputy director of British Influence, said: “The single market wasn’t on the ballot paper. To leave it would be devastating for the economy, smash our free trading arrangement and put thousands of jobs at risk. Why should people not only throw the baby out with the bath water, but the bath out of the window?”

His group will claim that Croatia provides an example of a country joining the EU and EEA separately, so identifying them as discrete groupings, and will cite research by senior academics on the issue.

“This is not an anti-Brexit measure,” he added.

But the government made clear it did not believe any attempt at a legal challenge would be successful, with Theresa May’s official spokeswoman insisting that Brexit meant leaving both organisations.

“Our position is clear, which is that the UK is only party to the EEA agreement in its capacity as an EU member state and once we leave the European Union we will automatically cease to be a member of the EEA – that is the legal framework,” she said.

A leading authority on European law also poured cold water on the idea. Jean-Claude Piris, a former head of the European council’s legal service, who served as official legal counsel on EU treaties, including Maastricht, Nice and Lisbon, said after Brexit the UK would not remain in the EEA.

“The UK’s withdrawal from EU will mean an automatic cessation of its membership of EEA as an EEA-EU member,” he said. “In order to become an EEA member you have either to be an EU member or an EFTA member.”

Non-EU countries have created the European Free Trade Association to promote economic ties. Current members are Norway, Switzerland, Iceland and Liechtenstein.

The UK was a founding member of EFTA, but left to join the European Community in 1973. Norway has warned it could block any attempt by the UK to rejoin EFTA.

The legal skirmish underscores the mind-boggling complexity of Brexit that will dominate the government’s agenda for years to come.

British Influence, which has written to David Davis, the Brexit secretary, suggests the government should not just be focusing on article 50 of the treaty on European Union, but on articles 127 and 128 of the EEA agreement.

It says there is no legal consensus that the UK is only “a contracting party to the EEA only as a member of the EU. There are numerous reasons why it may be a member in its own right: article 127 of the EEA agreement, for example, requires members to give 12 months’ notification to leave, without any reference to article 50; article 128 states that countries acceding to the EU ‘may’ apply to join the EEA, but are not compelled to.”

However, the government and Piris both pointed to another article – 126.

May’s spokeswoman said it represented “the first paragraph on membership in the EEA agreement – that says that it applies to the territories to which the treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied and under the conditions laid out under that treaty.

“Clearly, if you are leaving the European Union you are coming out of that so it does not apply.”

In theory, the dispute could be resolved by the European court of justice. Instead, she said May was focused on getting Britain the best deal and would do that.

A woman who has asked a court to withdraw life support treatment for her husband broke down in tears as she described his condition.

The court of protection heard police officer and Gulf war veteran Paul Briggs, 43, from Merseyside, was in a minimally conscious state following a car crash in July 2015.

The father of one, who is being treated at the Walton Centre in Liverpool, suffered a bleed on the brain, five fractures in his spine, bruising to internal organs and several other severe injuries in the collision.

His wife, Lindsey, mother to his daughter Ella, five, told the hearing in Manchester on Monday he did not recognise her or respond to her when she went to see him. She said: “The most important thing to him is independence. He is the kind of person who lives for the moment.”

She added: “He was a loving dad to his daughter, he would want to bring his daughter up.”

The court heard medical experts predicted that even in a best case scenario, Briggs would remain severely physically disabled.

Lindsey said: “I think he would see it as torture, just as hell, that everything he believes in and he lives for would just be taken away from him. He would be living for no reason.”

She said when she looked into his eyes she saw “at best, nothing there, or at worst, distress or suffering”.

But Conrad Hallin, representing the Walton Centre NHS foundation trust and the Wirral clinical commissioning group, said doctors had noticed some signs of improvement in his condition.

The life expectancy of people in Briggs’s condition is estimated to be nine to 10 years.

His wife told the court he had been active, sociable and a “hands-on father” before the crash. Asked what he might think of his situation now, she said: “If he is able to think, I think he would be horrified. Horrified for his daughter, that she’s scared of him.”

Briggs’s mother, Jan, said: “Every time I see Paul I can’t help thinking about the person he was and it’s very, very difficult to see him as he is now.”

She told the hearing she went to see him at least twice a week. She said: “It is very hard, but I think you just cling to that hope that he may recognise you or give some response. You just cling to that hope even though you know that it’s unlikely.”

She added: “I just don’t want him to suffer any more.”

The hearing is expected to last four days.

Chelsea Rowe, 26, received a 12-month prison term in July after admitting causing serious injury to Briggs by dangerous driving.

Liverpool crown court heard Rowe was driving a Nissan Micra that was in a head-on collision with Briggs’s motorcycle on the Birkenhead flyover.

A German federal court has thrown out a 95-year-old former Auschwitz death camp guard’s appeal against his conviction for being an accessory to murder.

The decision to uphold Oskar Gröning’s conviction sets an important precedent for German prosecutors’ efforts to pursue others who allegedly served at Nazi death camps.

Gröning was convicted in July 2015 of being an accessory to the murder of 300,000 Jews and sentenced by a court in Lüneburg to four years in prison.

Gröning testified at his trial that he oversaw the collection of prisoners’ belongings and ensured valuables and cash were separated to be sent to Berlin. He said he witnessed individual atrocities, but did not acknowledge participating in any crimes.

On Monday, the federal court of justice said it had thrown out Gröning’s appeal. It also rejected appeals from several survivors and their relatives who had joined the trial as co-plaintiffs, as is allowed under German law, and had sought more serious charges.

It is the first time an appeals court has ruled on a conviction obtained under the logic that serving at a death camp, and thus helping it operate, was enough to convict someone as an accessory to the murders committed there – even if there was no evidence of involvement in a specific killing.

At the original trial, the presiding judge, Franz Kompisch, said Gröning was part of the “machinery of death,” helping the camp function and also collecting money stolen from the victims to help the Nazi cause.

The federal court noted that Gröning’s responsibilities had included keeping watch on the inmates and preventing resistance or attempts to flee by force.

In 2011, John Demjanjuk, a former Ohio autoworker, became the first person convicted in Germany solely for serving as a death camp guard without evidence of being involved in a specific killing. Demjanjuk, who always denied serving at the Sobibor camp, died before his appeal could be heard.

More than 100 people have killed themselves in prisons in England and Wales so far this year, , according to penal reform groups, prompting warnings of a mental health epidemic within the incarcerated population.

The Howard League for Penal Reform said it had been notified of the deaths by suicide of 102 people up until 18 November – the equivalent of one every three days and breaking the record for frequency of suicides.

“With five weeks remaining until the end of the year, it is already the highest death toll in a calendar year since recording practices began in 1978,” said Frances Crook, the director of the Howard League. “The previous high was in 2004 when 96 deaths by suicide were recorded.”

Crookwho is meeting the justice secretary, Elizabeth Truss, on Monday, said: “The number of people dying by suicide in prison has reached epidemic proportions. No one should be so desperate while in the care of the state that they take their own life and yet, every three days, a family is told that a loved one has died behind bars.

“By taking bold but sensible action to reduce the number of people in prison, we can save lives and prevent more people being swept away into deeper currents of crime and despair.”

The current rate of self-inflicted deaths in prisons across England and Wales of nearly 10 a month means the final toll for 2016 could be as high as 115, compared with 89 in 2015.

A joint report, Preventing Prison Suicide by the Howard League and the Centre for Mental Health, links the rise in the number of prison suicides to cuts to staffing and budgets and the rise in the number of people in prison that has resulted in overcrowding.]

“Violence has increased and safety has deteriorated. Prisoners are spending up to 23 hours a day locked in their cells, the imposition of prison punishments has increased and a more punitive daily regime was introduced in prisons at the same time as the number of deaths by suicide began to rise,” it says. “The prison suicide rate, at 120 deaths per 100,000 people, is about 10 times higher than the rate in the general population.”

The report calls for a recently revised incentives and earned privileges regime to be scrapped and for an undertaking that prisoners with mental health problems or at known risk of suicide should never be placed in solitary.

The Howard League’s figures show that the highest number of self-inflicted deaths – six – this year have been at Woodhill prison, Buckinghamshire, which is at the centre of a high court legal battle.

Mr Justice Lavender gave permission on Thursday for a judicial review case to be heard, saying that evidence of repeated failures to implement policies to prevent self-inflicted deaths at Woodhill could not be dismissed as “operational failures”.

It has also emerged that an independent monitoring board at Bedford prison, which has had four deaths so far this year, wrote “an urgent letter of concern” to the prisons minister about the “alarming rise in prisoners attempting to hang themselves” at the jail before its recent riot. They highlighted that staffing shortages were “beyond crisis point”.

An independent monitoring board report published on Monday into Bullingdon prison in Oxfordshire warns that inadequate staffing is also damaging morale and relationships with prisoners.

“The board is concerned about increasing difficulties in recruiting and retaining sufficient officers to maintain levels defined as acceptable by the prison service. It has also observed that indiscipline and violence have increased noticeably since staff cutbacks were implemented in 2013,” says the Bullingdon report.

The chancellor, Philip Hammond, confirmed in the autumn statement last week that an extra £555m over the next three years would be made available to fund prison safety measures, including the recruitment of 2,500 extra prison officers.

A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said that mental health in custody was taken extremely seriously: “Providing the right intervention and treatment is vital to improving the outcomes for people who are suffering and all prisons have established procedures in place to identify, manage and support people with mental health issues.

“But we recognise that more can be done. That is why have invested in specialist mental health training for prison officers, allocated more funding for prison safety and have launched a suicide and self-harm reduction project to address the increase in self-inflicted deaths and self-harm in our prisons.”

Constitutional lawyers and White House ethics counsellors from Democratic and Republican administrations have warned Donald Trump his presidency might be blocked by the electoral college if he does not give up ownership of at least some of his business empire.



“The brand is certainly a hotter brand than it was before,” Donald Trump told the New York Times on Wednesday, and his election victory buzz does indeed seem to have been good for business.

Since the surprise outcome of the 8 November vote, foreign diplomats have been flocking to the newest Trump hotel in Washington to hear sales pitches about the business and vie to book their delegations into its rooms overlooking Pennsylvania Avenue for the inauguration on 20 January.

Trump, meanwhile, used a meeting with a delegation of Brexit activists including his closest British ally, Nigel Farage, to urge them to oppose wind farms which he felt would spoil the view from one of his Scottish golf courses. He also took time out from selecting cabinet officials to meet his Indian business partners and pose for pictures with them, while the Philippines government announced it was appointing his business partner in Manila as its next ambassador to Washington.

A day after a phone conversation between President-elect Trump and Argentinian president Mauricio Macri, Trump’s Argentinian associate – who was reported to have organised the call – confidently predicted that construction would start next year on the planned Trump Tower Buenos Aires, to be completed by 2020.

The associate, Felipe Yaryura, seemed supremely confident that the zoning restrictions that had stalled the project for years would soon be swept away.

In his interview at the New York Times, Trump insisted he no longer cared about his business interests.

“My company is so unimportant to me relative to what I’m doing, ’cause I don’t need money, I don’t need anything,” he said. “The only thing that matters to me is running our country.”

Yet much of what he has said and done since winning the election suggests that Trump comes to the presidency in the spirit of a tycoon making a new acquisition, overseeing the merger of Trump Inc and America Inc – a merger in which it is far from clear which would be the senior partner.

“It clearly degrades the presidency,” said Ian Bremmer, a political scientist and president of the Eurasia Group, a global political risk research and consulting firm.

“It is going to undermine the legitimacy of the US around the world. Soft power has been about being able to project values. That already took a hit. It really comes to an end with this election.”

Although the president-elect claims to have handed the day-to-day running of the Trump Organization to some of his children, he has so far retained his ownership stake and those same children are sitting in on his meetings with foreign leaders. Ivanka Trump, for example, was in the room during the president-elect’s first meeting with a foreign leader, Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe.

A few moments after expressing indifference to the fate of his business, Trump claimed: “In theory, I could run my business perfectly, and then run the country perfectly.

“And there’s never been a case like this where somebody’s had, like, if you look at other people of wealth, they didn’t have this kind of asset and this kind of wealth, frankly. It’s just a different thing.”

The US has certainly never had a commander-in-chief like Trump. When the constitution was written, the founding fathers wrote the rules so that people like themselves, whom they expected to fill the presidency, could do so without having to sell off plantations or slaves.

The president is exempt from conflict-of-interest laws that constrain other office holders. The discovery of this loophole seems to have surprised and delighted Trump.

“As far as the potential conflict of interests,” Trump said, “the law is totally on my side, meaning, the president can’t have a conflict of interest.”

The remarks were reminiscent, for presidential historians at least, of an earlier president who claimed that “when the president does it, that means it is not illegal”.

It was an interpretation of executive power that did not work out well for the US, nor for the president in question, Richard Nixon.

Constitutional lawyers are now warning that Trump’s presidency is in danger of going the same way as Nixon’s before it even gets started. Some say that unless Trump takes urgent steps to fully divest himself from his business interests, he might not even enter the Oval Office as president.

Trump seems to have received only a partial legal briefing on his exposure. Although the conflict-of-interest clauses do have a loophole for presidents, there is no such loophole for the “emoluments clause”, Article I, Section 9 of the constitution, which prohibits public officials from taking payments “of any kind whatever from any king, prince or foreign state”.

“Trump was totally wrong when he said the conflict of interest doesn’t apply to me,” said Norman Eisen, a former ethics counsellor to the Obama administration. “It shows he doesn’t know the constitution.

“The most fundamental conflict clause in the US constitution is the prohibition on emoluments on payments, presents or other things of value being given to American political officials including the president.”

Eisen, now a fellow at the Brookings Institution, added: “Because of [Trump’s] international investments he gets these payments, presents and things of value and he’ll be in violation of the constitution by the moment he takes the oath of office.”

Before Trump can even take that oath, he will have to be elected by the electoral college, another legacy of the founding fathers.

Under the constitution, this year on 8 November Americans chose electors, who are usually party officials, to represent their states in the electoral college. It is now up to those 538 electors to choose the president, when the college votes on 19 December. “Faithless electors” have in the past gone against the wishes of those who chose them, but never in such numbers as to change the outcome of an election.

The electors are under more pressure than usual because although Trump won the majority of seats in the electoral college, he lost the nationwide popular vote to Hillary Clinton by 2m ballots. Some legal experts argue that the electoral college cannot approve a candidate like Trump, who does not fulfil the basic legal requirements to be president.

Harvard constitutional law professor Laurence Tribe said in an email that the “electors who are to cast their votes for president on 19 December not as automatons but in light of constitutional constraints and principles cannot in good conscience vote for Donald Trump as president of the United States unless he fully divests himself of economic interests dependent on the fortunes, for good or ill, of the private Trump empire”.

That view is not restricted to academics and Democrats. Richard Painter, George W Bush’s chief ethics counsel, agrees that without a major reconfiguration of the Trump Organization, the president-elect is heading for a constitutional collision with the electoral college.

“The important thing for the electoral college is to ensure that he technically complies with the constitution,” Painter told the Observer. “This is just as important as the birth certificate. He should not be currently on the payroll of foreign governments.

“So he’ll have to provide assurance to the electoral college that he’s not himself going to be getting money from foreign governments that would violate the emoluments clause.”

It is implausible that Trump and his lawyers could offer such assurances without completely severing his links with his business operation. His empire has been built in many countries where the line between public and private ownership is thin and blurred. According to a count by the Washington Post, at least 111 Trump companies have done business in 18 countries in South America, Asia and the Middle East.

There are two Trump Towers in Turkey. During the campaign, Trump registered eight companies in Saudi Arabia, according to the Post. There is a hotel being built under the Trump name in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan. All these countries have authoritarian leaders, whom Trump has praised in recent years.

Over and above these entanglements, Trump has diplomats on foreign government expenses rushing to check into his hotels; he also has loans from state-owned banks. It is impossible to gauge the extent of his reliance on foreign governments without full disclosure of his business dealings and the publication of his tax returns, which he has thus far resisted.

Painter said the president-elect’s lawyers could perhaps construct a technical fix that ensured that any income from foreign governments was channelled into a separate corporation, under the ownership of his children.

Such a legal tweak might get Trump past the electoral college and into the Oval Office on schedule on 20 January, but it is hard to imagine it would dispel the cloud of suspicion that would hang over a Trump White House.

“It is catastrophic because you have a man coming to the presidency with a vast network of business interests, domestic and international, that will conflict, clash, collide, with his obligations to pursue the public interest,” Eisen said.

“Foreign policy is where conflict of interest, between the public and private interest, is sharpest because he has these projects all over the world. We’ll never know when he favours an ally or opposes an adversary whether he’s doing it for the sake of America’s national interest or his pocket book.”

Eisen and Painter called on the Trump transition team to take urgent steps to address the problem, before it triggers a constitutional crisis. They recommended he sell all his business holdings and put the proceeds in a blind trust, the composition of which would remain unknown to him, as his predecessors have done for the past four decades. Painter offered his advice to the Trump circle as a fellow Republican, but has not received any response.

At his meeting with the New York Times, Trump said he was looking at changes he might make, but seemed very reluctant to sell off his empire.

“That’s a very hard thing to do … because I have real estate. I have real estate all over the world, which now people are understanding,” he said. “It really is big, it’s diverse, it’s all over the world. It’s a great company with great assets.

“I think that, you know, selling real estate isn’t like selling stock. Selling real estate is much different, it’s in a much different world.”

Trump did not make clear why owning property made it harder to sell his stake but his resistance to such a move was apparent.

“His view is that the voters know about this and and they are OK with it,” said Robert Weissman, president of the Public Citizen watchdog group.

“But it is absolutely contradictory to his core message he was going to sweep away the corruption in Washington and all the deal-making.”

In 2020, voters will get an opportunity to decide whether Trump has delivered on that promise. Weissman thinks the threat of impeachment before then is remote, as that is a decision of the House of Representatives, where there is a solid Republican majority.

The GOP majority is much slimmer in the Senate, however, and there Trump has many enemies in Republican ranks. Although the Senate cannot initiate impeachment, it can hold hearings, summon witnesses and demand documents. It could turn a Trump presidency into one long financial scandal.

“He will not be able to get away with it for very long,” Eisen said. “This is a recipe for scandal. This has happened with every president, Democrat like Bill Clinton and Republican like Richard Nixon.

“When you get into a scandal, your old friends melt away. It’s an incredibly perilous situation.”

The year 2016 seems to have provided a helping hand for the increasing discrimination against Indonesia’s lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender communities. The constitutional court is currently mulling over a petition to revise the criminal code to make intercourse between same-sex couples illegal.

The conservative Islamic group driving the petition, Family Love Alliance (Aliansi Cinta Keluarga), argues that the country’s current laws lean too heavily towards western values, which they see as at odds with ours in Indonesia. Patrialis Akbar, one of the judges in the constitutional court, has said: “Our freedom is limited by moral values as well as religious values … We’re not a secular country – this country acknowledges religion.”

Indonesia’s communication and information ministry, with recommendations from the national police, religious affairs ministry and the Islamic group Majelis Ulama Indonesia (who issued a fatwa [a ruling on a point of Islamic law] against LGBT practices in 2014), has plans to ban gay dating apps such as Grindr. This comes just months after gay-themed emoji and stickers were removed from a popular messaging app in the country.

This year alone, government officials have said that there is “no room” in Indonesia for the LGBT movement, that it is worse than a nuclear bomb, and that LGBT people should be barred from university campuses. In February, Vice President Jusuf Kalla asked the United Nations Development Programme to not finance LGBT community organisations in the country. In the same month, the Indonesian Psychiatrists Association classified being LGBT as a “mental disorder” that should be “cured”. You get the picture.

But the most damning assessment further underscoring the pervading conservatism which restricts, if not outright threatens, the lives of LGBT communities here came in August. Human Rights Watch released a 91-page report on the matter, where you can read a story of a trans person, known here as a waria (a portmanteau of the Indonesian words for woman and man) in the city of Yogyakarta who was violently attacked in February by seven men while walking home.

You’ll also read about the hostile closure of an Islamic academy (madrasa) for transgender women in the same city – a place that had become a vital refuge to many.

These discriminatory acts have been abetted by politicians and lawmakers in Indonesia by way of rejoinders, policies or equally-punishing silence.

Last month, however, Indonesia’s president, Joko Widodo, vowed to protect any threatened minorities in an interview with the BBC. When asked about what he thought about the hearings in the constitutional court, he said he didn’t feel the need to change the law, and that the police must protect groups from violence. “There should be no discrimination against anyone,” he said.

The president’s statement, however, is not backed up by laws ensuring equal rights for LGBT people in Indonesia. In the deliberations over the United Nations’ New Urban Agenda signed last month at Habitat III, Indonesia and 16 other countries requested the removal of LGBTQ individuals in the list of “most vulnerable” groups that should not be discriminated against.

As Indonesia’s most populous and diverse city, Jakarta is home to many LGBT advocacy and community groups, including Suara Kita (which also acts a shelter) and Arus Pelangi. The city also serves as Indonesia’s most visible stage on which demonstrations for or against LGBT rights take place.

Last year rallies were held in central Jakarta calling for greater protection of LGBT rights and in celebration of International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia. But this year anti-LGBT banners were put up around the city by conservative Islamic groups and demonstrators protested against the Jakarta-based Asean Literary Festival for “promoting communism and LGBT values”.

I was curious to find out how LGBT people in Jakarta feel about whether the city is a safe space for them or not, despite the pressure from Islamic hardliner groups, and what their hopes for the future are.

I ran away from home after my mum told me to get out twice, my father compared me to an animal, and my aunt and uncle said that I’m an outlaw. All because my parents learned of my relationship with my girlfriend.

My parents had given me two choices to either break up with my girlfriend or leave the house. Although I chose the second option, they still tried to stop me. “You’d be better off without your limbs than this,” my mum said. Even though my family isn’t religious, they began tossing Bible passages in my way – hoping I’d get their message: that I’ve committed a sin.

So I ran away and went to Suara Kita to seek refuge there. Now I live alone and I hold down a steady job in Jakarta. To face each day, I feel fine. But whenever I get a flashback to those nights or those words that my parents said to me, it stops me in my tracks.

I’ve never been harassed or harangued when I hang out with my girlfriend in Jakarta – but we have been stared at on the train.

I know it’s hard, but I pray for more open-minded people, like the people in the PGI (Persatuan Gereja Indonesia, Indonesia’s church union) who issued a recommendation that we, as government or as a society, should accept LGBT communities. I’m hoping for the best.

I feel safe in my community; there’s more joy than sorrow. I feel accepted among my friends and they can comfort me since we have the same vision.

In some ways, Jakarta is inclusive – if we’re talking about mindsets and the character of a metropolitan society, which I think leans towards indifference. When people interact with me, they don’t really care and they talk to me without mentioning sexual orientation.

Some friends tell me that although they’re okay with having LGBT acquaintances, they still don’t want their children to be LGBT. Don’t expect same-sex public displays of affection to be the norm anytime soon.

I’m allowed to express myself, but not to voice an opinion or to explain my thoughts about whether gay rights are human rights. Aren’t gay rights the same as the rights to be free? To earn an honest living? To live without being discriminated against?

It has nothing to do with “western” or “eastern” values whatsoever. We have all wanted those rights for so long in Indonesia – it’s just that since our struggle is relatively new, it’s regarded as something unusual, ie something western. We just want to be accepted and acknowledged by others. We want to express ourselves freely without judgment or discrimination.

I am optimistic about our future. Eventually, the way people think will change, they’ll be more open-minded. It takes time for things to change, and it’s not easy, but I’m glad I’m part of it. I think that’s my hope and my fear for the future: to have the strength to carry on.

Being a woman and identifying as bisexual has meant I get asked a lot of insensitive questions (“Why don’t you just like guys only?”) as well as people telling me that it’s “just a phase”.

Jakarta felt safe compared to other places in Indonesia until earlier this year when the spotlight was cast on the LGBT community. Suddenly everyone seemed to despise us, when before they didn’t care about our existence at all. I constantly feel like I don’t belong and afraid, like somebody is going to hunt me down for loving someone that is of the same gender.

But being a metropolitan city with a huge population of all kinds of people, there’s a lot of strong LGBT communities, even one that aims to educate university students: SGRC Indonesia (Support Group and Resource Centre on Sexuality Studies).

When the higher education minister said that LGBT people should be barred from university campuses I felt betrayed.

I just hope at the very least that the government doesn’t pass the bill to criminalise LGBT relationships. I also hope that Indonesians – or at least the ones in Jakarta – will slowly realise that we have a right to live as they do, and stop hating us and start accepting us as another part of the super-diverse Jakarta.

In Indonesia’s LGBT communities we’re talking more about SOGIEB (sexual orientation, gender identity, expression and body) as an expanded way of addressing issues of personal freedom. I was a part of a SOGIEB-themed film festival in Jakarta, which we had to relocate and rename due to the fear of anticipated backlash.

I guess this is what living as a queer person is like in Jakarta: we always have to be careful not to rub people the wrong way. In the long run, what we ultimately wish for is integration – not just tolerance or acceptance.

To get there, however, takes time, struggle and hours of uncertainty because it boils down to the simple fact that Indonesians, as much as we enjoy sex to the point of obsession, are severely lacking in sex education itself.

On a personal level, I would like to simply be able to walk by myself, or hand in hand with my boyfriend in public without it being a magnet for attention, or even a political act. I don’t feel threatened when I walk on the streets, but who’s to say I won’t someday? And that’s one of my biggest fears going forward: that LGBT Indonesians are stripped of our basic rights to exist.

There is a lot of intersectionality between the LGBT rights movement, the women’s rights movement and the human rights movement. If more people under these movements join forces then we all could make some strides. I think we are making some strides already.

Instead of chalking everything up to “LGBT”, why not concentrate on SOGIEB education? I think that’s my hope for the future: that sex education about these issues becomes a priority.

In my view, we simply need to be kinder to one another.

When Christopher Seddon popped into a Waitrose store last May on behalf of his housebound 89-year-old mother, he was only planning to buy a few items to get her through the week. After paying, he was stunned when two policemen seized and handcuffed him in front of watching shoppers. He was then forced to spend six hours in a cell at the local police station before being charged with stealing £102-worth of meat.

Over the next three months Seddon, a published author who lives in north London, says he spent £9,600 on legal fees and expert reports to prove that it was a case of mistaken identity and clear his name. Eventually the case against him was dropped, and Waitrose offered £500 to say sorry because he is a “valued customer” – but he says the incident has left him thousands of pounds out of pocket and he describes the way he was treated as “nothing short of scandalous”.

Seddon’s nightmare began when he made his twice-weekly visit to see his housebound mother who lives alone near the Waitrose store in Chesham, Bucks. Each week he shops for her, but as he left the store on that fateful Saturday afternoon he was confronted by two police officers. “They seized me, then handcuffed me with my arms behind my back, stating that they were arresting me on suspicion of shoplifting 17 days earlier, in spite of the fact that on that day I hadn’t even been in Chesham. The security guard thrust a mobile phone in my face [with a CCTV still on it] and screamed ‘do you deny this is you?’ at me. All this was going on in front of dozens of shoppers.”

He says he was not allowed to call his mother, who he knew would be distressed when he inexplicably failed to return. He was held at Aylesbury police station for more than six hours.

“Despite the nightmare of the situation I assumed that I could clear up what was obviously a case of mistaken identity – but I was wrong. When I was eventually questioned, I was shown CCTV footage from the afternoon of 11 May showing a bald male aged about 60 concealing £100 of meat products in a bag and leaving without paying. I was told that I had been identified as the offender by the security guard from a CCTV still he had downloaded to his mobile. But on that day I was working on a book at my north London flat and, ironically, visited the Waitrose store on the Holloway Road.”

In a statement given to the police after Seddon’s arrest, the security guard claimed Seddon had also visited the Chesham store just a few days earlier and become nervous when he saw he was being watched. He said he then saw Seddon run from the store.

Seddon believes the police were greatly influenced by this claim. He says the CCTV evidence, not available at the time of his arrest, shows that while he was in the store at that time, it did not show him running away.

“I had come into the store for a bacon and egg sandwich for lunch, saw that there were none on the shelves and decided to go to Sainsbury’s instead. I left at a normal pace and never noticed the security guard. I even complained about the lack of bacon and egg sandwiches on Twitter. But the police believed the security guard’s account of me running from the store, as well as his claim that I was the man shown on CCTV stealing meat products, and charged me with the earlier theft.”

As a result, Seddon says he was forced to hire first a solicitor and then a barrister at a cost of £6,000 plus VAT. Knowing that he had been in London when the theft took place, but living alone, he had to employ a mobile phone expert to provide evidence to that effect. He also employed a CCTV specialist, John Kennedy, who made his name in the Jamie Bulger case in which CCTV footage was central to the conviction of the boys who abducted him.

Kennedy’s report states clearly that Seddon was not the person who had stolen the meat, and that the security guard’s claim that Seddon had run from the store was not true. It lists several key differences in the look of the two men, and even notes that their jackets were of different colours, contrary to what the guard told police. The expert report suggested that the photo of the thief on the security guard’s mobile phone was distorted in the act of downloading it. The image was compressed and the aspect ratio changed as a result, it said.

After Seddon had paid for all this, the case was dropped the day before it was due to be heard at High Wycombe magistrates court on the instruction of the Crown Prosecution Service. But Seddon says he has since been told by his solicitor that he will recoup no more than 20%-30% of his costs, leaving him substantially out of pocket. “Having cleared my name I approached Waitrose with my expert report, naively thinking that it would be horrified by what had happened and would offer me compensation for the inconvenience, distress and financial loss, as well as take urgent steps to ensure that such an incident could not be repeated,” he says.

Instead, he says the supermarket spent two months fobbing him off before concluding that its security guard had done nothing wrong.

“They offered me a derisory £500 as a ‘goodwill’ gesture to a ‘valued customer’. Their emails throughout were headed ‘Waitrose customer feedback’ as if the whole affair was of no more consequence than an unsatisfactory purchase from the bakery. If a security guard cannot distinguish between running and walking then it is a matter of significant public concern that they continue to be employed as a security guard,” he says.

A spokesman for Waitrose declined to offer an explanation as to what had happened. Instead, he pointed us towards Thames Valley police. “We are very sorry to hear of the distress Mr Seddon has experienced. You will need to speak to the Thames Valley police press office about the decisions taken. We are continuing our conversations with Mr Seddon and the third-party security company with whom we work so, as you will appreciate, it would not be appropriate for us to comment further at this stage.”

Seddon says questions remain as to why he was treated so badly. At a meeting last week with Thames Valley police, which is still investigating his complaint against the force, Seddon says he was told by a long-serving officer that he had not ever heard of a comparable incident.

Seddon is still furious at his treatment at the hand of the store, and is considering legal action. “If Waitrose will not accept responsibility, then sooner or later it will happen again to somebody else. For my part, I would have been better off accepting a police caution for a crime that I did not commit and paying Waitrose for £100 of meat products that somebody else stole. It is morally repugnant that I should be left thousands of pounds out of pocket when I have done nothing wrong,” he says.

Thames Valley Police said that as it had received a complaint in relation to this investigation it would be inappropriate to comment further.

Christopher Seddon’s treatment at the hands of both Waitrose and the police shows a gap in the law: a completely innocent person can be arrested and prosecuted and may not be entitled to any compensation, not even all of his legal costs, writes barrister Richard Colbey.

When police make an arrest they are not liable for the consequences if they act on reasonable suspicion. There are sound public policy reasons why they should be free to do their job without worrying too much about the consequences, so long as they behave reasonably. 



Here the report by the security staff gave them that suspicion and meant they were duty-bound to question Seddon, and entitled to arrest him. Marching him away in handcuffs was unnecessary and apparently deplored by a more mature police officer, but it was not unlawful.

Had the security guard effected the arrest the situation would have been different. There is not the same public interest in “citizens’ arrests”, and civilians have no protection if they arrest an innocent person, however reasonable the suspicion.

In 1992 a Marina Davidson was accused, wrongly, of stealing from Woolworths in Bangor. The court of appeal said that a security guard, and hence a Woolworths employee, could only be liable for an arrest if it was effected by the police – ie, if they had given some direction or made a direct request or encouragement that the arrest should be made. There the court of appeal decided that the store detective had merely made a report – but the guard in Seddon’s­ case may have overstepped the mark. 



Also it is possible that Seddon could claim slander, but that is a notoriously difficult and expensive cause of action. He would have to show the guard acted maliciously as, otherwise, what the guard said to the police would be privileged and also that he suffered “serious harm” – a somewhat vague statutory hurdle introduced in 2014 to discourage the proliferation of defamation claims.

A person acquitted of a crime will usually be able to recover his costs from public funds, but only at fairly derisory legal aid rates. These will be nothing like £10,000 even for a trial that goes ahead, and are typically hundreds, rather than thousands, of pounds. 



The Law Society advises solicitors to warn clients where they are incurring costs that are unlikely to be recoverable, and if Seddon’s solicitors had not given such advice then it could have taken a hit on much of the difference between its bill and the amount recovered.

• Update: Christopher Seddon has confirmed that his solicitors did advise him that he may not be able to recover all his legal costs of defending himself. The barrister’s view was amended on 28 November 2016 to clarify this point.

Labour to push for fairer access to the justice system

Comedian Eddie Izzard defended himself against a man who shouted homophobic abuse at him as a stand against “thousands of years of transgender people being aggressively attacked”, a court has heard.

Jamie Penny threatened to “do” the 54-year-old’s house after an altercation in Pimlico, central London.

A month later Penny, 24, shouted to Izzard that he was a “fucking poofter” after seeing him in a street nearby.

Penny, who is autistic, was found guilty of two counts of using threatening and abusive words or behaviour with intent to cause harassment, alarm or distress. He also admitted damaging a police cell after he was arrested.

Giving evidence at the trial, Izzard said he stood up to him and swore back because he had faced years of abuse for being a transgender man.

He told Hammersmith magistrates court: “It is something I do as a transgender man. Over years people have said very nasty things to me.

“I prefer to stand my ground. I do stand up for my rights and other people’s rights.”

The court heard that on 3 April Izzard had been moving bags by his vintage car outside his Pimlico home when he heard an altercation at a nearby pub, before two men approached him.

Izzard told the court one suddenly leaned close to his face and told him: “You should give me a ride in your car.”

The man was aggressive so Izzard said he told him he would “never have a ride in my car”, before a second man, Penny, told him: “Izzard, we are going to do your house when you are away.”

The comedian told the court: “It was totally aggressive. It had gone up into a verbal attack. He was walking away but shouting aggressively at me.” He told the court the incident had made him feel “very edgy”, and that he shouted back at him, telling him he was a “fucking idiot” and to “fuck off”.

Izzard said: “I was thrown because it had escalated. For hundreds of thousands of years transgender people have been aggressively attacked.

“I just thought, it is not going to happen – I am going to attack back with words.”

The court heard that a month later, on 4 May, Izzard was walking near Victoria station towards his house when he heard someone shout, “you’re a fucking poofter” from the other side of the road.

Asked if he recognised the man as Penny, Izzard said: “I knew it was the same guy who had shouted abuse at me, I am 100% sure.” 



Izzard told the court he hurled abuse back at him, saying: “I don’t run and hide, I stand my ground.”

Izzard told magistrates: “I am tough, I have run marathons, I wanted to stand up for myself otherwise you become a victim.”

He also told the court that he had been given Penny’s name by people at the pub near where he had first been abused, but had only decided to tell police after the second incident.

Under questioning, Penny said it was his friend who had threatened to “do” over Izzard’s house – and that the comedian had sneered at the pair, “talking to us like we are nothing”.

He said he did not even know Izzard at first, only looking him up online later after his friend told him he was a celebrity. 



On the second occasion, he said he had seen Izzard harassing a black man driving a Bentley, claiming the comedian had looked intoxicated, and had told him to leave the man alone before telling him to “go to hell”, denying he had called him a “poofter”.

And when Izzard told the court about the homophobic abuse, Penny said: “You’re not gay, why would I shout homophobic abuse at you if you’re not gay?” before blowing him a kiss from the dock. 



Magistrates said Penny, who the court heard has previous convictions for assault and possession of cannabis, would be given a restraining order and have to pay costs and compensation.

He was also ordered not to contact Izzard. Penny was bailed until 30 November when he will be sentenced at Westminster magistrates court.

Scotland Yard has adopted measures to increase knowledge of chemsex crime in the gay community after the police watchdog launched an investigation into “missed opportunities” to catch the serial killer Stephen Port.

In the wake of Port’s conviction, frontline officers were undergoing special training to deal with rape and sex crimes against males.



The measures were announced on Friday as the family of Jack Taylor, Port’s final victim, claimed their concerns over the initial investigation went unheeded because he had been dismissed as “a gay and a druggie and that was it”.



Port, 41, was given a whole life sentence without release for the murders of four gay men: Anthony Walgate, 23, Gabriel Kovari, 22, Daniel Whitworth, 21, and Taylor, 25. Port had surreptitiously given them fatal doses of the drug GHB to satisfy his fetish for sex with drugged, unconscious boyish-looking males.

Cdr Stuart Cundy, of the Met’s specialist crime and operations command, said the measures were “to enhance the knowledge and understanding of our officers about drugs-facilitated sexual assault, or sexual assault following chemsex”.



Frontline and specialist officers who investigated these offences were being trained with the help of the anti-violence charity Galop and other LGBT organisations. A toolkit and a checklist document had been created to provide guidance for officers on how best to respond to allegations.



A pilot study was launched by the Met in September to increase knowledge of the kind of drugs used to facilitate the sexual assault of men, Cundy said. Victims were being asked to provide a urine sample to test for GHB – also known as G or liquid ecstasy – which is the drug most commonly used in such cases.



As part of the study, tests for GHB were also being carried out on males who had died and there was evidence of sexual assault or the death was unexplained, he said.



The Met has already announced it is reviewing the deaths from GHB poisoning of 58 people in London over the last four years as a result of the Port case.



An anaesthetic, GHB is popular on the dance and club scene. At low doses, it is reported to produce euphoria, lowering social inhibition and increasing libido. At higher doses, euphoria gives way to sedation. Still larger doses can induce coma. In some cases, death can arise as a result of respiratory depression or the inhalation of vomit.

The Met has faced criticism in the past over its handling of the murders of members of the LGBT community. In 2007, a review of 10 murders of gay men or transgender people said in some cases police inquiries were hampered by a lack of knowledge, reliance on unfounded stereotypes and personal prejudices.



The report, written by the independent Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender advisory group, did acknowledge the force had substantially improved its dealings with the communities, but said more radical steps were needed.



Investigations of high-profile cases to have attracted criticism in the past include those of the serial killers Dennis Nilsen, Michael Lupo and Colin Ireland.

Hamlet will go on trial this weekend for murder, treason and regicide before an appeal court judge on a stage in the West End of London.

The aim of cross-examining Shakespeare’s most famous character about the fatal stabbing of Polonius is to deliver a fundraising performance for schools on the 400th anniversary of the playwright’s death.

The cast combines prominent lawyers with leading actors, including the Royal Shakespeare Company’s John Heffernan as Hamlet, Meera Syal as Gertrude and Tom Conti as Claudius.

The stand-up comedian Lee Mack takes the part of the Player King and the comedian and actor Hugh Dennis is the jury foreman, whose role is to return the verdict given by the entire audience.

Lady Justice Hallett, a court of appeal judge, will conduct the trial and four QCs, John Kelsey-Fry, Jonathan Laidlaw, Shaheed Fatima and Ian Winter, will lead the interrogation, demonstrating the similarity in skills required onstage and in the courtroom.

Money raised by the Sunday night performance at Wyndham’s theatre will be donated to the Shakespeare Schools festival.

In the play, the Prince of Denmark is being held in custody contemplating a life behind bars. Kelsey-Fry, a sought-after defence silk, will argue for Hamlet’s acquittal.

The show follows a successful mock trial of Macbeth that was staged last year and returned a surprise verdict of not guilty on the Scottish usurper.



Hallett said mock trial projects stimulated an interest in the law and helped young students develop their talents. “I relish the opportunity to combine my two loves of the law and the theatre on the West End stage and will ensure Hamlet gets a fair trial,” she said.

Syal, star of the BBC’s The Kumars at No 42 and Goodness Gracious Me, said she was “very proud to be supporting the Shakespeare Schools Foundation although a little nervous about the cross-examination”.

An “independent inspectorate” should be created to restore minimum standards of access to justice and establish equality within the courts, according to a report commissioned by Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour party leadership.

The interim study by the Bach Commission, published on Friday, acknowledges that deep cuts to legal aid imposed by past governments cannot be entirely reversed in the current financial climate.

Past economies, particularly the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Prosecution of Offenders Act 2012 (Laspo), it says, have reduced the justice system to a state of crisis with hundreds of thousands of people being deprived of the legal support.

The number of not-for-profit legal advice centres has fallen from 3,226 in 2005 to 1,462 over the past decade, exceptional case funding for legal aid fails to support those in desperate need and high court fees are deterring claimants pursuing justice in employment tribunals and the courts, the report notes. Since 2010, the annual legal aid budget has fallen from £2.1bn to £1.6bn.



While not formally adopted as Labour policy, the report, overseen by the former justice minister Lord Bach, was commissioned by Jeremy Corbyn and the previous shadow justice secretary, Lord Falconer. The Fabian Society has provided support. Other commissioners and advisers include Sir Henry Brooke, a former court of appeal judge, Julie Bishop, director of the UK law centres network, and John Cooper QC.



Aimed at developing future policy for the Labour party, the authors hope to build a broad consensus for improving access to the courts. The report quotes the current lord chief justice, Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd, as saying: “Our justice system has become unaffordable to most.”

The final study is due to be published next summer before Labour’s conference. It is being crowd-funded – an initiative increasingly used by claimants for bringing legal challenges that might formerly have been paid for by legal aid.

“Cuts to legal aid have created a two-tier justice system in which the poorest go without representation or advice,” the report says. “Our commission understands the economic and political imperative to control public spending, and we do not simply propose to repeal Laspo in its entirety.

“Instead, the commission will establish a set of minimum standards for access to justice, and explore policy options in a number of key areas to make those standards realisable.”

The report outlines six “core problems” in the justice system: loss of legal aid for housing, welfare, debt, immigration, medical negligence and family law cases; failure of the exceptional case funding scheme; lack of public legal education; mass closures of legal advice centres; higher court fees; excessive bureaucracy in the Legal Aid Agency; and antiquated technology.

On its main policy recommendations, the commission says it will develop “minimum standards for access to justice to be enshrined clearly in law – which could include legal aid for all those who need it, equality of arms [so that both sides are represented in a case], sufficient and comprehensive legal education, and the availability of accessible technologies of triage.”

An independent inspectorate, it says, “will consider the enforcement of these standards” in the same way that there is already a chief inspector of prisons. “The commission will consider whether there should be a chief inspector of the justice system to hold government to account,” it adds.

Legal aid was also cut under the last Labour government. Lord Bach, chair of the commission, said: “Our interim report shows that our justice system is creaking at the seams. The LASPO cuts have produced a crisis in the justice system and the poorest in our society can no longer receive the legal support they require.

“This unacceptable state of affairs needs challenging and changing. This report is the starting point in our ongoing work to redesign the justice system so that it works for all. The commission intends now to turn to working through the policy solutions to fix this crisis.”

Richard Burgon, shadow secretary of state for justice and shadow lord Chancellor, endorsed the findings, saying: “Since 2010, the Conservatives have implemented unprecedented cuts to legal aid, putting justice beyond the reach of thousands.

“There is much of substance in the report, which will be welcome to all those who value the principle of access to justice. I am particularly excited by the idea of enshrining in law a minimum standard for access to justice.

“A basic threshold for access to justice has the potential to be a historic advance in our law which could improve the lives of thousands.” 



A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: “We have a world-leading legal system and last year spent more than £1.5bn on legal aid.

“We must ensure legal aid is sustainable and fair – both for those who need it and the taxpayer who pays for it. That is why we have made sure support remains available to the most vulnerable and in the most serious cases.

“We have committed to carrying out a post-implementation review of the civil legal aid changes and an announcement on this will be made in due course.”

The failure of the independent inquiry into child abuse to explain how it investigated allegations of sexual assault on its premises has undermined its credibility, a former senior lawyer on the investigation has said.

Hugh Davies QC said in a letter published by the home affairs select committee that the inquiry’s leadership must provide a clear public explanation of what the allegations were, how they were investigated and what has been done to identify and address future risks.

Davies was the only lawyer who commented publicly on the events that have rocked the national inquiry over the past two months, following a request from the committee for written evidence on the departure of a series of high-ranking legal experts.

“It is in the public interest that [the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse] IICSA succeeds,” Davies said, and greater clarity on the allegations of sexual assault at the inquiry’s London headquarters would promote the chances of that.

All the other lawyers who have left, including the former lead counsel Ben Emmerson QC, his deputy, Elizabeth Prochaska, and another counsel, Toby Fisher, cited confidentiality to the inquiry as a reason not to comment to MPs. The chair of the inquiry, Prof Alexis Jay, refused to waive that confidentiality.



Emmerson was suspended in September and then resigned. Two weeks earlier, Prochaska left the inquiry. Since then, a number of other lawyers have left.

Davies, who left the inquiry in 2015, said the lack of any explanation about allegations made by a junior member of staff against Emmerson left “an impression that, rather than investigating … IICSA has reached a de facto compromise agreement … and ended the investigation”.



The committee report said the allegations involved claims that Emmerson sexually assaulted an inquiry worker in a lift. He denies the allegations.

Davies’ testimony was released as MPs on the committee published a critical report on the troubled investigation, and called for robust action to deal with the allegations and restore public confidence in the inquiry.



Yvette Cooper, the chair of the committee, said the inquiry’s response had been “wholly inadequate”. Robust action was needed to restore public confidence, including the appointment of an external person to investigate the case.



“Given that the inquiry was set up to challenge institutions for covering up internal problems or ignoring abuses of power, it is crucial that it shows it has a robust and transparent approach to dealing with problems of its own,” she said.

Cooper stopped short of supporting calls from fellow Labour MP Chuka Umunna for Jay to step down in favour of a senior judge, but, she said, “the inquiry needs to get back on track … it is too important to be sunk by problems … urgent action is needed to sort them out.”

She criticised delays in setting up the Truth Project and holding public hearings, which showed a “significant weakness” in engaging with survivors.

Cooper called for the inquiry to appoint a new counsel as a priority and to consider splitting its work into two strands; a forensic, lawyer-led investigation to establish the truth about past institutional abuse, and a second strand looking at thematic issues around child protection.

The report was published as a person from the survivors panel, which was set up as part of the inquiry, called for it to be allowed to get on with its job. Chris Tuck said she had suffered vicious trolling on social media by some survivors that was hard not to take personally. “The few people who want this inquiry disbanded are robbing the victims and survivors … of the opportunity to finally have their voices heard,” she said.

Davies said that despite confidentiality issues he was able to comment in the interests of transparency on the allegations of bullying and sexual assault matters that had been in the public domain.



When taken together, they left a negative impression, which was compounded by unofficial briefings from inquiry sources in the media that undermined the alleged victim’s account.



“I would criticise any failure by an institution to act, and IICSA must expect to be judged by the same standards it will doubtless set for others,” he said.

“IICSA will investigate and make findings on institutions that have put reputational advantage ahead of a duty to investigate, including the use of compromise agreements with the subject of disclosure. If that is what has occurred here, the reputational harm to IICSA is obvious. If it is not, it is in IICSA’s interests to correct this impression.”

Any disclosure of bullying or sexual assault relating to the conduct of a senior member of staff towards a more junior employee, whether it was a formal complaint or not, amounted to abuse of power, he wrote.



“History demonstrates that, where bullying or other abuse reflects an imbalance of power between individuals, it is more likely to be repeated,” he added.

Jay said in a statement: “We recognise that the past few months have been difficult for the inquiry, and for the victims and survivors who have placed their trust in it. I am personally sorry for any unnecessary anxiety the inquiry may have caused to victims and survivors during this transitional period.”

She said the inquiry would appoint an external senior legal figure to review some of the issues raised in the committee’s report.

Relatives of Woodhill prisoners who took their own life in jail have launched a judicial review, calling for action over safety procedures at the prison, which this year recorded the highest number and highest rate of self-inflicted deaths across the entire prison estate.

There have been 17 suicides at the high-security Woodhill prison, in Milton Keynes, since May 2013, and at least six this year, a rate of about one every 45 days.

Despite guidance from coroner reports and from the official body that investigates deaths in custody, the families claim the prison has failed to implement basic preventative measures, according to legal papers.



The claimants hope their legal challenge will secure a high court order compelling the Ministry of Justice and the prison’s governor to put in place measures to reduce the risk of self-inflicted deaths. These measures are already required by law, but the claimants believe the prison has not managed to get staff to follow the guidance.

A high court judge granted permission on Thursday for the judicial application to proceed.

Mr Justice Lavender rejected a MoJ submission saying that appropriate steps had been taken at the prison to prevent further deaths and that the families’ claim was misconceived and unarguable.

The judge said that reports on the prison revealed “repeated failure, despite earlier recommendations, to implement applicable policies”. He said this could not be dismissed as operational failures.

Pearl Scarfe and Julie Barber, the mother and sister of Ian Brown, who took his life in his cell in Woodhill on 19 July 2015, have brought the claim, together with Jamie Blyde, the brother of Daniel Dunkley, who died on 2 August 2016, four days after he was found hanging in his cell.

The high rate of suicides at Woodhill come at a time of rising deaths inside prisons nationally. In the 12 months to June 2016, there were 105 apparently self-inflicted deaths, a 28% increase over that period, and when taken together with homicides inside prisons this was the highest level for 25 years, according to MoJ figures cited in the legal challenge. The number of incidents of self -harm also rose by 27%, to its highest level since records began, over the same period.

Jo Eggleton, partner at the legal firm Deighton Pierce Glynn, who represents the families of nine of the 17 people who have died since May 2013, said: “This case is borne out of the families’ desperation. They don’t want another family to go through this and it absolutely crushes them when they hear that another one has. They have been through every legal avenue they can – there have been inquests and coroner recommendations and nothing has changed. It happens again and again in very similar circumstances.

“What’s missing is the detail of what the prison is doing. But when there are more deaths in similar circumstances it is hard to believe they are doing enough.”

The judicial review seeks to address the “exceptionally high current rate of self-inflicted deaths at HMP Woodhill”. The papers state: “There is no mystery about what needs to be done; the problem is that the defendants are not doing it.”

The safety procedures that need to be taken to reduce the risk of deaths are already set out in MoJ policy and are mandatory. But the families argue thatit is clear from investigations by the prison and probation ombudsman, made each time someone dies in prison, that the governor had “failed to put in place appropriate general measures for the protection of inmates from suicide”. In one coroner’s report, there was clear frustration at the prison’s failure to implement their recommendations.

The report says: “There needs to be an urgent review as to why the necessary measures to prevent suicides from recently admitted prisoners have not been implemented.”

The summary of the families’ case states: “The reports identify similar failings occurring in case after case. They include repeated failures to comply with the requirements of national policy on suicide and on emergency response.”

One of the key recommendations is that the governor should ensure that there are full suicide risk assessments for newly arrived prisoners. The legal papers state that in seven in nine deaths where an inquest was heard, there was no compliance with the regulations setting out how prisons should respond to a medical emergency.

Deborah Coles, director of the charity INQUEST, welcomed the legal challenge. “The shocking failure of HMP Woodhill to act on a body of recommendations exposes the absence of a robust system to ensure that action is taken. Repeated calls for urgent change are ignored and deaths continue.”

An MOJ spokesperson said: “This matter is the subject of ongoing legal proceedings, so it would be inappropriate to comment further at this stage.”

Theoretically, yes. Theresa May is adamant that Brexit will go ahead when she triggers article 50 before the end of March, and has insisted there will be no second referendum. At the moment it is verging on political heresy to say the UK should not proceed with leaving the EU, because that was the democratic outcome of the referendum. However, there was nothing binding about the vote and no legal obligation for the government to pursue Brexit.

The most straightforward technical way of stopping Brexit is to not trigger article 50, which fires the starting gun on two years of negotiations with the EU. After this point, there are conflicting legal views on whether it would be possible to rescind notification that Britain wants to leave. Some, such as Donald Tusk, the EU council president, believe the UK could withdraw its application to leave, but others, including the British government, hold that it would be a one-way track to the exit door.

At the moment, the majority of MPs are in favour of respecting the result. There are a few exceptions, including some Liberal Democrats and the former Labour leadership contender Owen Smith, who want another referendum after a deal with the EU has been negotiated; and a handful of diehard remainers, such as the Europhile Tory MP Ken Clarke, who want to halt the process altogether. This could probably only change if there was an obvious shift in the public mood towards staying in. That could push politicians to rethink their fervour for carrying out the “will of the people” in favour of Brexit. However, such a shift is unlikely before the end of March.

There is a high court ruling that says parliament must give its approval for Brexit before article 50 can be triggered. The government is appealing against this, but if the judgment stands MPs could theoretically prevent Brexit. It is unlikely, however, that they will do so given that Labour has indicated it will support legislation paving the way for Britain’s exit – likely to be in the form of a three-line parliamentary bill. On the other hand, MPs may try to hold up the process by asking for more details about May’s strategy and demands before giving their approval. While there is a majority of MPs in favour of proceeding with Brexit, there is probably no majority for a hard Brexit involving a clean break with the single market and customs union.

Economic gloom popularly blamed on Brexit could conceivably cause voters to rethink their support for leaving the EU. In his interview with the New Statesman, Blair suggests this is one of two situations in which people could change their mind about Brexit. He says people might reconsider if the exit terms negotiated with the EU looked so economically damaging that the “pain-gain” ratio made it no longer worthwhile. But there is a strong argument that this would only happen if and when people’s jobs, finances and lives had already started to be affected by an economic slump.

The second situation outlined by Blair is that the exit terms negotiated with the EU seem so similar to the status quo that people question whether the UK should bother leaving. This is perhaps a less likely scenario because May has been adamant that she will not accept one of the fundamental pillars of the EU: freedom of movement. At the moment, there appears to be little appetite from EU leaders to change their rules to keep the UK in the bloc, although international politics can shift substantially during two years of negotiations.

Probably, or a general election won by a party campaigning to drop Brexit. The crunch point would come at the point of May returning from Brussels with an exit deal, and if parliament felt the result was not satisfactory and decided to vote it down. It would be difficult for the prime minister to avoid giving the Commons and Lords a vote at this point.

If this happened, the prime minister could either try to negotiate a better deal, or decide to bypass parliament by getting her own mandate for the deal. Her choices would be to hold a general election, or run another referendum, either on the terms of the deal, or on whether to proceed with leaving at all, bearing in mind that it is not yet clear that article 50 can be withdrawn once triggered.

The decision to call another referendum would be highly contentious and divisive. Leave campaigners would not give up without a fight, especially if there were to be a narrow result in favour of staying in.

The government does not accept that the devolved administrations have a veto, although it has promised to give them a consultative role in the process of leaving the EU. However, the Scottish and Welsh governments have been allowed to take part in the supreme court appeal, which may determine how much say they have over the Brexit process through their own legislatures.

Scotland is the most likely to want to halt Brexit as its voters wanted to stay in the EU. Further down the line, Scottish National party MPs in Westminster could play a role in trying to block any deal done by May, clubbing together with MPs from other parties if they do not like the terms.

In Northern Ireland, the ruling Democratic Unionist party is in favour of Brexit but a campaigner for victims of paramilitary violence has won the right to a hearing in the supreme court aimed at blocking Northern Ireland from leaving the EU.

December brings not only the countdown to Christmas, but a nerve-wracking time for the students invited to interview for a place to study law at Oxbridge and several other universities. So if you are one of the chosen few, how can you give yourself the best chance of winning a place? Four law tutors provide an idea of what to expect and tips for making the most of the opportunity.

The form of the interviews vary across institutions, but the general approach is the same. At Oxford, explains Rebecca Williams, a law fellow at Pembroke College, students are interviewed two or three times over a couple of days by separate panels, each made up of two or three law tutors. Interviews will often take the form of mini-tutorial. Beforehand, students are given a passage of text, which may be part of a judgment, with any legal jargon removed, and asked to discuss it.

The format for the interviews at Cambridge follow a similar pattern. Candidates have two interviews conducted by different law fellows, explains Claire Fenton-Glynn, fellow and law lecturer at Jesus College. One will involve the student being asked about an extract of a legal text that they have been given in advance, and the other is more “free form”, in which students are asked to consider scenarios.

For instance, students last year were asked a question about the “Keep off the lawn” signs that are a common sight on the college grounds: “If no one could see you and if no one would find out, would you walk on the grass?”

To test their responses, students were asked to consider whether they would walk on the grass if they were late for their interview, or if they saw a person choking on the other side of it. If they said they would walk on the grass, they might then have been asked what gave them the right to break the rules, and whether all rules could be broken.

Tutors stress that no legal knowledge is required or expected of those being interviewed. They are not interested in whether the students give the right answer – there may not even be right answers. They are really looking at a student’s comprehension skills and their ability to take in information, analyse it, and think critically, says Fenton-Glynn.

What is being assessed, says Williams, is “raw intelligence”, and the ability to cope with the course. “We are testing their logical reasoning and want to see how they think and how their brains work.”

The fundamental skill they are looking for, says Sam Lucy, director of admissions for the Cambridge colleges, is “precision of thinking” – most other things, she says, can be taught. She wants to see if students can pick up on the subtleties and ambiguities of language that shows they recognise matters can be interpreted in different ways. “It’s about have a sensitivity to language with almost a mathematical bent.”

Students, she adds, are not there to defend a particular position and should not feel bound to stick to one line of argument, particularly if they feel they have gone down the wrong path. Tutors will give hints for students to change their minds and want to see if they can pick up on them. Sticking doggedly to a position, warns Thomas Krebs, law tutor at Brasenose College, Oxford, may indicate that a student is not open to being taught. He says it is a fault typically seen in students from some independent schools, who have often been told to stick to their guns. “We want to see if you are flexible and can be taught.”

Given the format and subject matter of the interviews, there is little that students can do to prepare – at least practically. The best thing to do, says Fenton-Glynn, is to read widely – and not necessarily legal texts, but newspapers and blogs.

She recommends the HE+ website, which allows students to explore law, giving guided activities, questions, videos and further reading.

And candidates should not get hung up on what to wear. Whether you wear your school uniform, a suit or jeans and a T-shirt, the important thing, says Williams, is to wear something you feel comfortable in and that enables you to perform at your best. Fenton-Glynn agrees: “You are not assessed on your appearance. We’re looking for the best students, it’s as simple as that.”

Trinity Mirror has no right to own newspapers. Its board should resign. Read the story of what the publisher did to Robert Norman, as detailed in a Press Gazette interview, and you will understand why.

Let’s begin with these statements of principle that guide journalists in Britain and Europe:

“Journalists have a moral obligation to protect confidential sources of information.” (UK editors’ code of practice) “A journalist protects the identity of sources who supply information in confidence.” (National Union of Journalists’ code of conduct) “Protecting sources is a key principle of journalism for which some journalists have gone to jail.” (BBC editorial guidelines)

Now consider the judicial support for that principle:

But Trinity Mirror did not agree. It sacrificed that principle. In so doing, it set in train events that have wrecked the life of a confidential journalistic source: Robert Norman, former prison officer.

He is not the only one of Trinity Mirror’s victims. Nor is the Daily Mirror’s owner the only sinner: News Corporation also revealed the identities of the sources of Sun reporters.

What is different is that Norman has become the first of the 32 sources who were convicted under Operation Elveden, the Metropolitan police investigation into newspaper payments to public officials, to speak out.

Here is what happened to him. In April 2006, he was working at Belmarsh maximum security prison in London, acting as health and safety officer for the Prison Officers’ Association.

He was upset about the management’s failure to deal with the fact that a female officer was having an affair with an inmate, regarding it as a potential danger to staff.

So he phoned the Daily Mirror newsdesk and was put in touch with reporter Stephen Moyes. The story, leaked by other prison colleagues, broke before Moyes could get to it, but he asked Norman to get in touch should anything else happen.

Norman told Press Gazette’s editor Dominic Ponsford: “I did, over staff cuts and security. All the stories I gave him were in the public interest, highlighting dangers to the public and dangers to staff.

“Stephen managed to get a story in about the staff cuts and we went from there.”

Over the following five years, Norman shared 40 pieces of information with Moyes. In return he received tip fees totalling £10,684.

Money, he stresses, was not the driving factor. Ponsford lists some of the stories. They included the regrading of prisoners to ease overcrowding, security issues over laptops, a prisoner’s suicide, excessive expenditure on a staff party and the prison’s failure to pass security inspections.

In 2011, he decided to stop giving stories to Moyes, who had moved to the News of the World. He said: “I cut all ties with Stephen and decided to concentrate on getting through to retirement.”

But two years later Trinity Mirror took a fateful step. Caught in the backwash of phone-hacking allegations and aware of News Corp having passed on information about payments to public officials, it decided to do the same.

Norman was one of those identified in the documents it passed to the police. And, in May 2013, Norman was roused from his sleep at 5.45am.

Sixteen police officers “barged into my house,” he said. “All that was missing were the helicopters and the napalm.” He was placed on police bail for two years, prosecuted for committing misconduct in a public office and, after a three-week Old Bailey trial in 2015, he was convicted and sentenced to jail for 20 months.

By contrast, charges against Moyes, and other journalists, were dropped after the Crown Prosecution Service reviewed Operation Elveden cases. Sources, however, were not spared. Moyes was upset about the prosecution of Norman.

Norman had to sell his house in order to pay the £51,000 costs of his defence. His wife’s mental health, already fragile, deteriorated. She attempted to take her own life and was committed to psychiatric care on three occasions. (Now, thankfully, she is said to be “on the road to recovery.”)

Norman served six months in prison and five under home detention. Last month, he lost his appeal against conviction. He is planning a further appeal to the supreme court.

He now lives on the £64 a week, which he receives from the state as his wife’s full-time carer.



Ponsford asked Norman what he thought of Trinity Mirror’s action. He replied: “You’re a source and journalists are supposed to look after their sources...

“I think the way myself and other whistleblowers have been treated is absolutely atrocious.”

Moyes, who left the Mirror for the News of the World and later moved to the Sun, clearly agrees. He registered his dismay at Norman being charged, saying: “Without him a number of important security and safety exposés would have been hushed up.”

Trinity Mirror, which declined to comment to Ponsford, confirmed to me that it is not making any response. No surprise there. How could it be anything other than embarrassed by Norman’s sad story? 



I repeat. The board should resign. It is led by chairman David Grigson and chief executive Simon Fox. Vijay Vaghela is the finance director, and there are five non-executives: Lee Ginsberg, Steve Hatch, David Kelly, Helen Stevenson and Olivia Streatfeild.

Grigson, Fox and Vaghela were in post when the decision was made to inform the police and are therefore responsible for breaking a cardinal rule of journalism. The five non-execs, who were appointed later, should also consider their positions.

If any of them have a shred of respect for the trade from which they profit they should step down.

At least 25 Indian NGOs have lost licences to receive international funding because of their “anti-national” activities, while a further 11,319 have lost licences for failing to renew them, shrinking India’s pool of foreign-funded organisations to a little more than half the number it was two years ago.

According to the Ministry of Home Affairs, the licences were revoked because the NGOs “failed to meet legal requirements” under the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) (pdf) of 2010. The move could mean that some NGOs reliant on international funding will be forced to close.

Many of the 25 NGOs received notices saying their licences would be cancelled based on the government’s “field reports”. They said they were not given any indication of which laws they had violated or what the field reports said.

Henri Tiphagne, executive director of social justice and human rights organisation People’s Watch, said the decision to revoke his NGO’s licence was the latest in a series of moves by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata party to quash opposition.

“The government is determined to see no dissent. I completely uphold the principle that NGOs should be transparent and that is why we have been filing all the documents, and we have even put our accounts from the last 10 years on our website,” he said. “But the government should at least give us a reason why they have taken this step, so if we need to appeal the decision we know what we are appealing against. …

“It’s harassment for the NGOs. When things go wrong, we speak up. Perhaps that is what is irritating the government.”

Dunu Roy, director of the Hazards Centre – which also lost its licence – said: “All we know is that there is a field agency report, but we don’t know which field agency, or what the report says, or when it was written. They can’t take one-sided action like this. If they found a genuine reason that we should not operate, then they should tell us that reason.”

Charities said that, with the bulk of their funding cut, they would find it difficult to keep operating in India. Anil Chaudhary, who heads the Indian Social Action Forum (Insaf), another NGO that lost its licence, said: “Around 85% of our funding comes from foreign donations. Now we cannot receive foreign funds and we cannot operate our accounts.”

Many NGOs had opposed the government’s draconian laws by refusing to file renewal documents. They argued that human rights and environmental groups that campaign against Modi’s corporate-friendly development programmes were being targeted by the government.

Modi’s latest cull is part of a growing antipathy towards NGOs as India tries to modernise its infrastructure and push economic growth. In February, Modi said NGOs were acting as fronts for foreign lobby organisations or terrorist groups conspiring to destabilise India and defame him.

In 2014, a leaked Intelligence Bureau document to Modi said foreign-funded NGOs that highlighted issues such as caste discrimination, human rights or environmental concerns were part of a “growth-retarding campaign” to discredit India at international forums. Under his government, major international charities including Greenpeace have been targeted by the government.

A joint statement from Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch said the government was using the FCRA to muzzle NGOs. “The law’s use of broad and vague terms such as ‘public interest’ and ‘national interest’ have left it open to abuse,” read the statement.

It added that in May the government temporarily suspended funding licences for the Lawyers Collective, citing alleged violations under the FCRA. “The charges appeared to be politically motivated because of their work in routinely representing people in cases against the current government, including Priya Pillai of Greenpeace India and Teesta Setalvad, an activist who has been seeking justice for victims of the 2002 communal violence in Gujarat.”

Three UN special rapporteurs have urged Modi to repeal the FCRA, which they say is being used increasingly “to silence organisations involved in advocating civil, political, economic, social, environmental or cultural priorities, which may differ from those backed by the government”.

Home ministry spokesman KS Dhatwalia said he would not comment on why NGOs had been targeted by the government. “Obviously, the government has no personal agenda against these NGOS. The NGOs know there are certain regulations they are supposed to follow. If you do not follow the law of the land, your licence will be removed. It’s as simple as that.”

Letters: Judges could be elected in part by the public from among suitably qualified and experienced lawyers
###########################################################
Lord Neuberger rightly addresses the need for diversity on the supreme court bench (Report, 22 November). The proposed measures including flexible working practices and changes in the recruitment process are to be welcomed. However, the article goes on to state that there is a wider “criticism of the composition of the judiciary” particularly at senior levels from which supreme court judges are recruited. There is a radical solution: judges could be elected in part by the public from among suitably qualified and experienced lawyers. In this way the judiciary would more accurately reflect the public they serve. Judges could in turn then elect the supreme court from among their own numbers.

Last month I persuaded a few dozen people to have a “squirting water fight” outside parliament to highlight the absurdity of UK sex laws. The digital economy bill – currently at committee stage – is an outrageous attack on the sexual liberty and personal privacy of adults in the UK. It will destroy the livelihoods of many adult industry workers, particularly webcam performers and DIY porn producers such as me. Making and selling our own content online gives us autonomy over our work – but the mandatory age verification and censorship this legislation will impose on online porn will take that away.

I own and operate Dreams of Spanking; a niche BDSM (bondage, domination, submission and masochism) site with films expressing my personal sexual fantasies. Running my own website gives me total freedom to do what I want on camera, with the people I choose. Authentic and performer-centric sites such as mine are exactly what the porn industry needs – but small-scale independent websites will be devastated if the digital economy bill is passed into law.

I’m no stranger to censorship. Last year, Dreams of Spanking was unsuccessfully targeted under the Audiovisual Media Services Regulations 2014, because my consensual BDSM videos depict spankings that leave marks. After a traumatic, invasive investigation, I was forced to take my site offline – and I was left in no doubt that the law considers kinky sexualities such as mine to be obscene.

I sought legal help, and eventually won my appeal and reopened the site. But I had a mere four weeks to enjoy my victory before the digital economy bill was presented to parliament, and I realised that I was going to face being criminalised all over again.

I can’t help that I like spanking. I’ve known I was fascinated by the idea since childhood, when I read about it in books and wondered what it felt like to experience. I kept my interest secret, feeling ashamed without really knowing why. As I entered puberty, I felt like a freak.

It wasn’t until I got online in the late 1990s and found free previews for online pornography (which I wasn’t legally old enough to view) that I realised I wasn’t alone. For the first time, I began to understand that maybe I wasn’t the only person on the planet who found the idea of spanking erotic after all.

This is why I make BDSM porn: I want to send the message that there’s nothing wrong with being kinky, and to help isolated individuals feel less alone. There’s nothing wrong with us; our fetish isn’t harmful to society. On the contrary, it does great harm to criminalise sites that are a lifeline to people with marginalised sexualities.

By bringing in mandatory age verification the digital economy bill will force homegrown porn out of business. Feminist, queer and indie porn sites are labours of love. We don’t make much money, and can’t afford to securely age check every site visitor. We bring much-needed diversity to the adult industry, and disrupt the homogeneity and heteronormativity of mainstream porn. We empower performers, depict authentic self-expression and subvert stereotypes. It’s our sites that will disappear if this becomes law – not the behemoths of traditional porn, which are far more likely to be stumbled across by those not ready for that content.

Not only that, but age checks requiring users to submit identifying details to prove their age will enable record-keeping on a global scale. Do you want a private company to own a database of every porn site you’ve ever looked at – and would you trust a “tube site” to keep that data safe? Me neither.

Most worrying is the list of “prohibited content” – material that the digital economy bill seeks to ban entirely. This is based on the BBFC classification guidelines, which excludes an awful lot of consensual sex acts from R18, the highest category. Acts that are legal to perform in the UK, but not legal to depict in porn, which includes fisting, watersports and female ejaculation (if the fluid lands on another person, or is consumed).

What message are we sending to young women by criminalising porn that depicts a visual, undeniable representation of female sexual fulfilment? Do we really want girls to think that the way their bodies naturally respond to pleasure is obscene?

The UK’s laws around sex and porn need bringing up to date. The BBFC rules ultimately derive from the Obscene Publications Act – a law dating from 1959, when it was still illegal to have gay sex, never mind film it. It’s absurd that this law should still be controlling what we can do with our bodies.

If we want to help young people stay safe online, we need to teach privacy skills and how to critique the media they will inevitably encounter online. We need to make sex education mandatory in schools – and we need it to answer the questions young people are asking, such as: how will I know when I’m ready to have sex? And when I am, how can I make my partner feel good? Attacking online porn is a cheap way to score political points – and it’s a distraction from the real issues.

Irish trade unions have launched a campaign for a referendum to abolish an amendment to the Irish constitution that pro-choice campaigners say prevents serious reform of strict anti-abortion laws.

The leaders of some of the country’s biggest unions gathered on a bridge over the river Liffey in Dublin on Wednesday morning to call for the repeal of the eighth amendment, which gives an unborn child the right to life, for the first time since it was passed more than three decades ago.



The amendment was introduced through a referendum in 1983. Ireland’s then politically influential anti-abortion lobby, in alliance with the Catholic church, forced the Fine Gael-Labour coalition to hold a national vote to in effect make an embryo into an Irish citizen. It passed with 67% voting in favour.

Pro-choice groups say the amendment creates a legal “chill factor” among medical teams, even in cases where a recent law allows for terminations in very limited circumstances, such as when continuing with a pregnancy would result in the woman’s death or in cases where she is suicidal.

At the Rosie Hackett bridge, named after a prominent 20th-century Irish revolutionary feminist and trade unionist, the country’s trade union leadership said it was time to give a new generation of Irish voters a chance to overhaul Ireland’s anti-abortion laws.



Mary Diskin, a spokeswoman for the Trade Union Campaign to Repeal the Eighth Amendment, said: “Abortion is a reality in Ireland: between 1980 and 2014, at least 163,514 women registered for terminations abroad; many others gave no personal details.”



She said the near total abortion ban hit lower-paid women hardest given that it costs up to €3,000 to travel to Britain for a termination.



Diskin said it was the duty of unions to campaign against “the cruelty to women that they have to leave this jurisdiction for a service that is available throughout the world but not available here in Ireland”.



Unite’s regional secretary, Jimmy Kelly, said: “Last year, over 3,400 women travelled from the Irish Republic to Britain to access abortion. As a pro-choice union, Unite has consistently argued that the eighth amendment must be repealed as a first step to enabling women to access safe, legal and affordable terminations in Ireland.”



However, Kelly expressed some doubt that the Fine Gael-led minority government was strong enough to push through legislation that would lead to a new referendum on the issue. 



“Every issue seems now to be affected by this government being propped up by Fianna Fáil and I wouldn’t be hopeful that they make the move that we need made to repeal the eighth. It will probably happen in the next government,” he said.

In Turkey, backbenchers of the ruling AK party have proposed that child rapists be allowed out of jail on the condition that they marry their victims, a scheme that will supposedly allow girls under the age of 16 to be “reunified” with the men who abused them as a family unit. When I first heard the news, I started sobbing and couldn’t stop. I kept thinking about all the girls who would go through what I had gone through. I couldn’t imagine this becoming legal.

I feel ashamed of being a Turk. It is awful enough that the rape of children happens; but now they have tried to legalise it. I thought that we’d moved on, that those days were behind us. Now I realise nothing has changed. Men are still doing their best to put women precisely where they want them to be.

Why am I writing anonymously? Because I am still frightened of my attacker.

When I was 14 I lived in southern Turkey. I was top of the class and very popular. I had a close friend from school, and sometimes I would go to her house. Once or twice I met her older brother, who was about 15 years older than me. I called him “abi”, meaning “elder brother”. We didn’t really speak. One day my friend said, “My abi wants to take me to the cinema, will you come with me?” I asked my mother and she said yes – he was regarded as an important man in the community and was well respected.

He took us out a few times in his car. He always dropped me off first before taking his sister home. Then, one day he dropped my friend off and drove in the opposite direction to my house. I was terrified. He stopped the car just outside town and turned to me. I started screaming before he could touch me. Suddenly a policeman approached the car and asked what was going on. He tried to lie; he knew he was in trouble, but he was taken to the police station. I was escorted home and sent to my room. The next day I was not allowed to go to school.

My uncle came a couple of days later, saying, “I’m going to sort this out, but you have to get engaged to this man.” I said there was no way I would, but my uncle said I had to if I wanted to go back to school. I found out later that they changed my birth certificate to make me two years older, so that my friend’s brother could be released from prison.

Once we were engaged, I was allowed back to school, but the teachers humiliated me and I lost all my friends. I got good marks and I could have gone to university. But my mother and uncle said, “No, you’re going to get married.” I refused. They said, “Look, this will be a formality, you can’t go to university if you don’t get married.”

I remember the day my family put me in a taxi to the registry office. I made them stop the car twice; I was desperate, terrified. Both times they said, “No, you have to go, otherwise we will be humiliated.” I signed the papers and we started our life together as a married couple.

There was not a second that I didn’t hate. All my aspirations and hopes had been dashed. I started working and at least that was something, but then he told me I had to leave work. He made my life an absolute misery, but I couldn’t do anything because he had control of our money. When I asked for a divorce, he said he would cut me into bits and scatter my parts – and “no one will find you”.

This is exactly what is going to happen to these girls in Turkey if the law is changed. It happens already, and it’ll be even worse: legally sanctioned rape. For now, the bill has been withdrawn owing to a public outcry – but the fact that it was proposed is a dark indication of the priorities of this government. There is no guarantee that a similar proposal won’t be made in future.

When people talk about rape there are many cliches, but what is absolutely true is that the victim thinks that they’re the one who is the cause of it; that they are the problem. They think: “Why couldn’t I have pushed him harder, why couldn’t I have bitten him or scratched his face?” I could never be the same again, that was the horror of it all. In the end I escaped, but it nearly killed me.

The change in the law being proposed is cultural, not moral, and the government knows this. It argues it’s for the good of the raped child and her offspring – that it will make her more respectable, save her honour and keep the family together. But actually it’s all about getting the man off the hook. If they change the law, men will be able to rape girls and then say, “I’ll just marry her.” And what’s the good of that? Once you’re married, you’re given the licence to be raped, again and again and again. At least if it wasn’t legal then you wouldn’t have to be married. At least you wouldn’t be sentenced to be your attacker’s sex slave.

Condemning a girl to a lifetime of rape is taking everything from her – her youth, her future, her happiness. When I heard the news, I knew I had to share my story. I want people to know what it’s like to go through this.

Lord chief justice says he hopes ‘problem-solving courts’ scheme is expanded and warns of shortage of high court judges
###########################################################
Honestly, these cryonics stories are driving me mad (Report, 18 November). As someone with terminal cancer (and ignoring the fact that I find the description in your articles of people like myself as “cancer victims” to be teeth-grindingly irritating) I feel everyone is ignoring the fact that a young woman looked into her future and saw the denial of everything she was promised. She was denied boyfriends, university, a job, marriage, children, life… and she was not ready to give up on those promises. She didn’t want to die. None of us does. I’m grateful that the judge had the good sense to realise this was not about whether cryonics worked, but her own hopes for the future. Reading some pieces lately it seems that while we’ll arrange bungee-jumping days out for the terminally ill, how one disposes of one’s own corpse is a step too far in giving the dying what they’re asking for.

Fewer criminals should be jailed and tougher community punishments developed as an alternative to imprisonment, the lord chief justice has urged.

Appearing before MPs on the justice select committee on Monday, Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd also warned there was a shortage of high court judges partially because of cuts in their pension rights and that up to 40 would need to be recruited by over the next few years.

The most senior judge in England and Wales welcomed the introduction of US-style “problem-solving courts”, whereby offenders are brought back regularly to have their sentences and progress reviewed by a judge after conviction.

Thomas said there had been a “pause in the government’s thinking” but hoped the scheme would be expanded. “There’s an awful lot we can do to avoid sending certain people to prison provided that the orders are properly carried out by the probation and rehabilitation companies,” he said. 



“The prison population is very, very high at the moment. Whether it will continue to rise is always difficult to tell. There are worries that it will. I don’t know whether we can dispense with more [offenders] by really tough, and I do mean tough, community penalties. So I would like to see that done first.”

His comments come as jails in England and Wales endure a turbulent period. This month thousands of prison officers staged a walkout amid claims the system was “in meltdown” after a rise in violence and self-harm incidents in jails. There are more than 85,000 people in prison in England and Wales.

Thomas said the latest survey of morale among the judiciary showed serious concerns, reflecting resentment over cuts in the value of judges’ pensions and changes to their working practices.

An employment tribunal is hearing a claim by more than 200 judges who allege that they have been the subject of discrimination because newly appointed judges have been given less generous pension provision.

The lord chief justice said that on recruitment, judges take a “huge salary cut” from their work as barristers in private practice. High court judges are paid about £180,000 a year.

There is a shortfall of about six high court judges. “We will need to recruit 30 to 40 over the next few years,” Thomas told the select committee.



The transfer of more and more low-level cases, such as motoring offences, to online courts is likely to result in a more organised system of publishing the names of those who have pleaded guilty or been convicted, Thomas said. 



MPs on the committee did no ask him about his response to being labelled along with the master of the rolls, Sir Terence Etherton, and Lord Justice Sales as “enemies of the people” by the Daily Mail after their Brexit ruling.

Asked, outside the committee room, whether such attacks depress judicial morale, Thomas told reporters: “I have observations to make but it’s not proper to make them at this time. There’s an appeal still before the court.”

The 20-year minimum terms handed to a teenage couple believed to be Britain’s youngest double-murderers have been referred to the attorney general for being “unduly lenient”.

The boy and girl were both 14 at the time when they killed Elizabeth Edwards, 49, and her 13-year-old daughter, Katie, at their home in Spalding, Lincolnshire, in April. Afterwards the couple had sex, shared a bath and watched four Twilight vampire films, their trial heard.

Now both 15, the couple were handed life sentences by Mr Justice Haddon-Cave, who said the pair had a toxic relationship and acted in a grotesque way.

Sentencing them at Nottingham crown court earlier this month, the judge said the case had “few parallels in modern criminal history”.

He told the teenagers: “There was remarkable premeditation and planning – it was, on any view, substantial, meticulous and repeated.



“The killings were brutal in the form of executions and both victims, particularly Elizabeth Edwards, must have suffered terribly in the last minutes of their lives.

“Had you been adults you may have been facing the whole of your lives in prison for this double murder.”

The court was told the boy, who admitted murder, used a kitchen knife to stab both victims in the neck after attacking them as they slept.

His girlfriend, who helped to plan the “cold, calculated and callous” killings, denied murder. Her defence argued that she had an abnormality of mental function that impaired her ability to form rational judgments. She was found guilty after a five-day trial.

The case was referred to the attorney general under the unduly lenient sentence scheme and law officers have 28 days to decide if any action should be taken.

A statement from the attorney general’s office said: “We are unable to provide the details of who referred the case. The threshold to refer cases to the court of appeal is very high.

“A sentence can only be regarded as unduly lenient if there has been a gross error and it is significantly below the level that any judge could have reasonably imposed after considering the facts of the case.”

Britain often claims to possess the finest justice system in the world, with a “colour blind” approach to the law. Unfortunately, this isn’t true: justice is neither colour blind, nor is it equal.

Historically, the justice system has been used to legitimise slavery, and then colonialism, from Elizabethan England onwards. In Kenya, between 1951 and 1954, during the Mau Mau uprising, more than 1,090 Kenyans were executed by the British colonial judiciary, backed by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. This appalling figure represents the most liberal use of the death penalty in British legal history and is double the number of those executed by the French during the war of liberation in Algeria 10 years later.

In more recent times, judges have enforced the unjust “sus” laws (the informal name used for stop-and-search laws which still disproportionately affect BME people). It can be argued that racism is embedded in the DNA of the British judiciary and that it has proved uniquely resilient to education or training.

But to what extent is racism present in the system today? A study headed by David Lammy MP, published last week, makes for very disturbing reading.

In 1991, statistics regarding how differently BME and white suspects were dealt with in the criminal justice system helped to trigger race training for all full-time judges over a five-year period. Those statistics have not improved. If you are an African-Caribbean man you are 16% more likely to be remanded in custody than if you are white; you are also likely to obtain a custodial sentence of 24 months compared to your white counterpart’s 17 months. This is not because African-Caribbean men commit more serious offences than their white counterparts – these are punishments handed down for the same or similar offences. African-Caribbean men are also subject to receiving immediate custodial sentences with fewer previous convictions than their white counterparts. Our perceptions have become the reality that means 41% of all young people in detention are now from BME communities.

What is critical is that the report highlights, yet again, the fundamental racist disparities in the dispensation, administration and dissemination of justice. There is a crisis of both trust and confidence in the British judicial system among black communities. Their concerns are that it remains arbitrary, inconsistent and discriminatory. This interim report proves them right – despite its diplomatic language.

Of course, poverty, homelessness and drug addiction all play their part, as does the disproportionate influence of an institutionally racist police culture, which means black defendants are stopped and searched seven times more often than their white counterparts. This is despite falling stop-and-search figures, and falling crime generally.

A significant responsibility for this disparity of treatment still lies with an overwhelmingly white, middle class and male magistracy and judiciary, resistant to ethnic monitoring, which hides behind the fallacy that justice is “colour blind and impartial”.

We cannot expect to have a diverse judiciary and magistracy, and to recruit police officers, probation officers, prison officers and lawyers who look like us and are knowledgeable of our communities, if we are forced to operate in a system that is itself unwilling or unable to deliver justice equally to all. As Martin Luther King said, “It is not possible to be in favour of justice for some people and not to be in favour of justice for all people.”

At present, out of 161 members of the high court judiciary, there is not a single African-Caribbean judge, while only two are of Asian origin. Less than 2.5% of Oxford and Cambridge graduates (from whom 86% of high court judges are drawn) are of African-Caribbean origin. The legal pipeline and the outcome are a self-fulfilling prophecy. The race training introduced in 1991, was only introduced on the basis that high court judges were exempt, as they simply did not require it. That rather arrogant intellectual exception must now be addressed.

Lord Neuberger’s comments last night suggest that he knows judicial diversity needs tackling. I am currently suing the Ministry of Justice for race discrimination and victimisation arising out of short speech on judicial racism and human rights I gave. It was at a meeting to protest at the decision of an electoral deputy high court judge to ban the former mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, from holding public office for five years. The allegation was that I indirectly criticised a fellow judge, the first time any judge has ever faced disciplinary action for this charge.

Several months later, in November 2015, there was an attempt to suspend me, approved by several high court judges, and the Judicial Conduct Investigations Office, who threatened me with a formal suspension. This was at the same time that a fellow immigration judge of African origin had her complaint of sex and race discrimination ignored while the three white judges accused were never faced with suspension. A fellow Asian district judge still faces disciplinary sanctions for a minor complaint that at most was a competence issue, and three other BME judges are currently suing the Ministry of Justice. The treatment of BME judges by our white colleagues demonstrates a culture in which we are not accepted as equals with a fundamental right to challenge discrimination. Little wonder then that BME defendants and litigants face race discrimination in all jurisdictions.

Even if one achieves a “critical mass” of BME judges and magistrates, the injustice is unlikely to be eradicated if the culture of who is perceived to be the likely recidivist or the most “dangerous” offender persists. The only solution is the one resisted by the Ministry of Justice, and by most senior judges – that is monitoring each crown court and magistrates centre so that there can be proper scrutiny of individual courts to identify where the problem lies.

Allied to this must be a full acknowledgement by the Sentencing Council that sentencing and bail guidance must set out clearly the levels of disparity for each offence. Simply pretending the problem does not exist is a recipe for unconscious but appalling levels of racial bias to continue unchecked.

The training on race from 1991 to 1995 worked, as it forced judges to engage with BME mentors who challenged subconscious bias and racism as equals in a secure setting. The race awareness training practised in the 20 years since has been discredited as wholly ineffective. It is too polite, conducted infrequently and by fellow judges who themselves are part of the problem.

The judiciary is a pillar of our democracy with a historical responsibility for the racism that affects our fundamental freedoms and rights. If that is to change, it must work hard to eradicate disproportionate sentences and bail that remove the freedom and rights of people of colour. Justice cannot be the prerogative of a narrow, white middle-class elite, who believe that racism is a problem for other lesser mortals to confront.

A Dutch journalist, Okke Ornstein, is being held in jail in Panama after being arrested last Tuesday (15 November) on a charge of criminal libel.



He is facing a 20-month prison sentence over articles published on his blog about the business practices of a Canadian who lives in Panama City, Monte Friesner.

The Dutch Journalists Association (NVJ) has called for Ornstein’s release, arguing that the charge is baseless.

Its secretary-general, Thomas Bruning, said the prison sentence “is against the fundamental principles of freedom of speech and the freedom of expression, principles that are acknowledged as fundamental rights worldwide.”

His call is backed by the International and European Federations of Journalists (IFJ and EFJ). IFJ’s president, Philippe Leruth, said: “Journalists should be able to investigate freely. The messenger is being punished [for his message].

“This prison sentence sends a signal that critical journalism on fraud and corruption is not possible in Panama. Ornstein is being punished in a way that does not comply with the principles of a democratic justice system.”

According to Ornstein’s lawyer, Channa Samkalden, Ornstein did not get due process during the criminal proceedings in Panama following a complaint from Freisner.

NVJ is working with the Dutch foreign ministry and the Dutch embassy in Panama to secure Ornstein’s release.

Ornstein, who works for Dutch broadcasters and Al-Jazeera, often writes about corruption and fraud cases on his bananamarerepublic blog (which is currently closed).

His broadcasting work has been nominated for awards, such as the Prix Europa radio prize in 2013 and the Tegel prize in 2015.

In the former instance, his radio documentary about the environmental consequences of a hydroelectric dam in Panama funded by a Dutch bank prompted questions in the Dutch parliament.

Parents of transgender children fear their ex-partners will sue them for custody of their children after the high court ruled that a seven-year-old child who the mother perceives as transgender should be removed from her care.

Four mothers of trans children have said their ex-partners have threatened to take them to court for custody of their child in the wake of the ruling, says Mermaids, an organisation that supports young trans people and their families, which also supported the mother in the high court case.

“We have had four separate parents come forward, in cases where the ex-partner doesn’t agree with the child’s [gender] presentation,” said Susie Green, CEO of Mermaids. “All the ones that have come through so far have been the mum who has custody and the father is unsupportive.”

One of these mothers was recently served with papers from her ex-partner beginning legal proceedings regarding the care of their child. She said her ex-partner has also indicated he will try to get a court order to prevent her from allowing their child to wear female clothing to school.

The mother says that her former partner had initiated the proceedings after reading about last month’s high court decision, a ruling that she said “turned my family’s world upside down”.

Green says the fathers have felt emboldened by the high court judgment, which ordered that a seven-year-old child should be removed from their mother because the judge ruled she had caused the child “significant emotional harm” through her determination they live “life entirely as a girl” despite being born male.

“I find that she has overborne [the child’s] will and deprived him of his fundamental right to exercise his autonomy in its most basic way,” wrote Mr Justice Hayden. “This is not a case about gender dysphoria, rather it is about a mother who has developed a belief structure which she has imposed upon her child.”

“[The fathers] have literally said: ‘I’ve seen this [the court ruling]. I’m going to take you to court,’” said Green. “Parents are very, very frightened, and rightly so.”

Another mother, Miranda, said that a few days after the high court ruling in October she was contacted by her ex-partner, who threatened to take her to court to get their child, who was born female but now identifies as male and is known as Jake, removed from her care.



“He’s quite pleased with the news [of the high court ruling] because he’s tried to have Jake taken off me in the past,” said Miranda. “I think he was almost trying to prove that it’s some kind of agenda that all single mothers have to get back at their ex-partners. He said: ‘Look, this mother’s done it too, forced their child to be of another gender.’”

Miranda says her former partner is unsupportive of Jake’s new identity, which he believes Miranda has forced on him.

“He thinks that our boy is still a girl – he’s supposed to have the clothing that Jake wants to wear, but he doesn’t,” said Miranda. “I still have female clothing if Jake chooses to wear it, you still have to be open to the possibility that he might turn around and say: ‘I’m Joanna again’, even though Jake’s telling me that’s never going to happen.”

Miranda said that after reading the news about the high court ruling she was “petrified” the same thing could happen to her.

“I just sat down and stared for quite some time,” she said. “I’m tired. I cry myself to sleep at night sometimes. But it is what it is. I know that it’s not a phase, you have an instinct for a reason, you’ve just got to fight for making sure your child’s happy.”

Other parents also expressed fears to the Guardian that in supporting their child’s trans identity they might jeopardise their right to custody of the child if that were ever contested.

Paula has a child who was born male, but identifies as a girl. She dressed in female clothes from the age of two, from the age of four she insisted on being called by female pronouns and would cry inconsolably at the thought of growing into a man, her mother said. She is now known as Emily.

“All I’ve ever done is follow her lead. I’ve not always wanted a trans kid, it’s not like it’s my parenting dream,” said Paula.

Paula says that Emily’s father, from whom she is separated, has found the situation difficult and recently said he was worried she was “putting ideas into [Emily’s] head” about cross-sex hormones, which are available to young people in the UK from the age of 16. The medication is available following a diagnosis of gender dysphoria from a gender identity clinic and after a year on hormone blockers.

“It looks like I don’t have any rights here and I’m just kind of terrified about what would happen if social services were involved,” Paula said of the high court ruling. “Would they view me the same way that this woman was viewed?”

Lucy who has a trans daughter, Evie, said that while her partner is supportive of their child’s identity, her mother is not and the court ruling has made her afraid.

“You do question it: could somebody use that [a child’s gender identity] to take your child away from you? It makes me worried that she’s going to use that against me with social services.

“You feel like you’ve done the right thing when you’ve helped your child transition. But then the court case comes out and you think: am I doing something wrong?”

Sarah Cornes, head of family law at TWM solicitors, said that while high court rulings did create precedents, and “clearly there is going to be a lot of concern” among parents in reaction to the ruling, the decisions made about where children live and how long they spend with each parent are “usually very fact-specific”.

“You can’t just say: there was a case and therefore everybody else’s situation will be affected. The overriding criteria in any case is what is in the best interests of the child,” said Cornes.

“[Being transgender] is not a phenomenon that people can deny the existence of; it’s a question of what weight would be given to the stated wishes of the child to transition. And of course it depends on the age of the child; the younger the child the greater the extent that external factors will be considered.”

The delivery firm CitySprint is to become the latest British business embroiled in a legal dispute over the gig economy when it faces demands at an employment tribunal to treat its freelance couriers as workers.



Mags Dewhurst, who has made deliveries for the firm for more than two years, will argue on Tuesday that she should be given worker status, and the rights that come with it, such as holiday pay and the national minimum wage.

The case is the first of four against different courier firms that will be heard by the same judge. The other cases, against Addison Lee, eCourier and Excel, will be heard next year.

Jason Moyer-Lee, the head of the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB), which is backing the riders, said the cyclists worked for one company at a time and were obliged to take work they were given throughout the day.

He said independent contractors were able to send others to do their work, but that was not possible for Dewhurst and the other riders.

“Even though the courier firms say Mags can send a substitute, she can’t really, as there are restrictions that prevent that,” he said.

Moyer-Lee said the point of the cases was to test the status of the workers. CitySprint, which has 3,500 self-employed couriers in the UK, could face further claims if the tribunal finds against it.

Dewhurst said: “I’m taking this action because I have personal experience of [earning], and know many courier friends earn, below the national minimum wage. Our lives tend to be thrown into financial chaos when we want to go on holiday.

“Worker status will finally redress some of the balance between couriers and courier companies, and transform our lives for the better. These benefits have for too long been withheld by courier companies and only serve to make it easier for them to exploit their workforce. It is time to afford couriers some basic employment rights.”

An employment tribunal last month found in favour of drivers for the taxi-hailing firm Uber, who argued that they should be classed as workers. Uber has appealed against the ruling.

Moyer-Lee said: “We were confident before the Uber case. [Dewhurst] fits all the criteria [of a worker] – so does pretty much any other pushbike courier I’ve met.”

Matt Gingell, an employment law partner at Gannons Solicitors, said: “The employment tribunal may well be influenced by the Uber decision. But that judgment is not binding and the facts will be different in these cases.”

A spokesman for CitySprint said: “We can confirm we have received notification of a tribunal claim. As you will appreciate, due to the legal process we cannot comment any further on this at this stage.”

The tribunal is expected to start hearing evidence from witnesses on Wednesday.

A new law is needed to criminalise impostors wearing military medals and decorations, the parliamentary defence committee has said, despite admitting there is only anecdotal evidence for the extent of it.

Julian Lewis, chair of the committee whose report is published on Tuesday, described the impostors as “contemptible fantasists”.

“Military impostors commit a specific harm that requires a specific criminal sanction. Other countries have sought to maintain these sanctions, for reasons of deterrence and punishment, while the United Kingdom has foolishly disposed of them,” he said.

“We support the aim of the bill to remove this anomaly, and have called our report Exposing Walter Mitty, because those who seek public admiration by pretending to have risked their lives are contemptible fantasists who need to be deterred.”

The committee says the law, which dates to the aftermath of the first world war, should have been revised rather than scrapped in 2006.

The Ministry of Defence was wrong to decide that impostors could be prosecuted under other offences, and that there was a lack of clarity in the law, the committee says. It supports a private member’s bill, the awards for valour (protection) bill, sponsored by Gareth Johnson, the Conservative MP for Dartford, which is scheduled to have its second reading in the Commons on Friday.

“The committee concludes that the deceitful wearing of decorations and medals is a specific harm which is insulting to the rightful recipients of these awards, damaging to the integrity of the military honours system and harmful to the bond between the public and the armed forces. This specific harm was considered to require a specific criminal sanction.”

The report insists there is a “strong body of anecdotal evidence” of “tangible and identifiable harm”, but concedes the incidence is difficult to determine from official statistics. “The experience of encountering military impostors among the service charities which submitted evidence also seems to vary.”

Internationally, the report notes that other countries have criminalised the deceitful use of decorations and medals, “to the extent that the lack of such protection in the United Kingdom can be considered exceptional”.

In 2009 a Warwickshire man, Roger Day, was arrested and pleaded guilty to wearing 17 medals and an SAS tie pin when he joined a Remembrance Day parade. He was later reported to have sold the medals, which his wife had bought for him, believing she was replacing ones he had genuinely earned. The case against him was later withdrawn.



At the time the MoD said the case was unusual because most of those who impersonated veterans were trying to extort free meals or drinks, or a bed for the night, rather than wanting to show off their decorations in public.

Another lawsuit has been filed over the film London Fields – this time directed at actor Amber Heard.

In the $10m suit filed by the film’s producers, Heard, who starred as Nicola Six in the adaptation of the 1989 Martin Amis novel, is alleged to have “breached performance and promotional obligations”, the Hollywood Reporter wrote.

The star-studded film features Heard as a psychic who foresees her own murder, alongside actors Billy Bob Thornton and Jim Sturgess, with a cameo by her former husband Johnny Depp.

London Fields was slated to make its debut at the Toronto film festival last year before being removed from the festival lineup after reports emerged that director Matthew Cullen would sue the producers for fraud, claiming they were marketing the film using his name despite debuting a version that he had nothing to do with. His suit against Christopher Hanley and other producers complained that footage of “9/11 jumpers edited against pornography” and a juxtaposition of “the holiest city in Islam against mind-control” had been inserted into the film.

The producers called the cancellation an “ill-considered decision made against our rights” at the time. In a statement, Muse Productions said Cullen missed deadlines to submit a “director’s cut”. Hanley’s Nicola Six Limited then filed a cross-complaint against Cullen. This latest suit is listed as “closely related” to that complaint, according to the 24-page document posted online by Deadline.

The suit against Heard, filed in Los Angeles superior court, stated that “Heard’s conspiracy, her campaign against the Picture, and her contractual breaches … have damaged the Picture, causing substantial harm to the Plaintiff, the Picture, and the Picture’s investors”. Among many claims, it alleged that she breached confidentiality obligations, failed to perform certain acting services and failed to comply with her publicity contract, according to the document. Later in the document, it states that her “misguided and unlawful conspiratorial campaign” against the film is ongoing.

The film has received mostly poor reviews with the Guardian’s Henry Barnes calling it “awfully silly”.

Hundreds of asylum seekers who are detained in UK immigration centres could be released after a high court judge ordered the government to review its policy on incarcerated torture survivors.

Justice Duncan Ouseley ruled on Monday that the Home Office must immediately provide “relief” to detainees at an interim hearing, releasing survivors of torture from countries such as Afghanistan, Nigeria and Sri Lanka.

Human rights lawyers, representing an initial 20 cases, had launched a legal challenge against the Home Office’s new definition of “torture” introduced in September, arguing that an unreasonably strict interpretation of the word meant that “potentially hundreds” of people have been illegally detained after claiming asylum in the UK.



The Home Office accepts that asylum seekers who have survived torture should only be detained in exceptional circumstances. Its definition had previously included any act of torture by any individual or group – but it was redefined to refer to torture carried out by official state agents only.

It is believed several hundred asylum seekers from the Middle East and Africa said they had been been tortured but are unable to prove their suffering was sanctioned by their country of origin, and have therefore been detained while claiming asylum in the UK.

Examples of detained asylum seekers referenced in court on Monday include an Afghan man in his early 20s who was reportedly kidnapped and tortured by the Taliban because he refused to be groomed into joining them. The Afghan man was beaten with knives, sticks and a gun, and the court heard his injuries are consistent with his account. Last month the Home Office told him his case did not meet the new definition of torture.

In another case, a Nepalese man said he was beaten, cut and and shot by a terrorist group in his home country. His ordeal is said to have lasted 15 days and he has scars consistent with his account but, again, his case was not held to meet the new definition.

In his conclusion, Mr Justice Ouseley expressed concern that under the new policy a number of decisions had been reached unlawfully, concluding that “I should grant interim relief in the form [requested by lawyers for the claimants]”. Ousely went on to confirm the Home Office would revert back to its previous broader definition of torture while the legal challenge continues.

A full hearing on the Home Office policy is scheduled for early next year but legal experts said that in the interim hundreds of asylum seekers would have to be released from immigration centres.

Ouseley ruled that pending trial, references to “torture” should be taken to mean “any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession, punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed, or intimidating or coercing him or a third person, or for any reason based upon discrimination of any kind”.

During the hearing, the Home Office also said independently of the legal challenge that it is reviewing 340 cases identified between 12 September and 18 November, where people who claim to have been tortured may have been wrongly detained.



If they are deemed to be survivors of torture under the old definition, they will be released. Human rights lawyers say they have also identified other cases of detainees who they say have been tortured and who should be immediately released.



Toufique Hossain, director of public law at Duncan Lewis which brought Monday’s challenge, welcomed the ruling. “We know from NGO groups and other firms that there are others – given that non-state torture is a common feature in those who are traumatised. Today’s decision could potentially affect hundreds of people.



“We are asked for a suspension of the policy until the final outcome of the hearing. We want the current policy to be quashed and requested the immediate release of anyone currently detained [under it]. This decision will potentially protect hundreds of detainees. It really shouldn’t matter when assessing whether a person should be detained, if the perpetrators are state officials or not.”

Rory Dunlop, the Home Office’s representative in court, said that to overturn a policy that had only been in place for two months was “a radical thing to do”.

Theresa Schleicher, acting director of Medical Justice, a charity that works to improve the health of immigration detainees and is involved in this legal challenge, said: “We welcome today’s decision to suspend the narrower definition of torture and to revert to the previous, wider definition. It will mean that more vulnerable torture survivors will be protected from being detained and being harmed by detention.”

The Home Office said: “We have noted the decision to grant interim relief at the procedural hearing. Given this is an ongoing legal case, for which there has yet to be a substantive hearing, we are unable to comment further.”

Rapper the Game has reportedly been ordered to pay $7.13m after being found guilty of sexual assault.

According to TMZ, a court in Illinois found in favour of plaintiff Priscilla Rainey, a contestant on She’s Got Game, a dating show where women compete to date the Game.

She sued him for $10m with claims that the 36-year-old was “out of control” and intoxicated which led him to grope her on multiple occasions in 2015. The Game’s legal team tried to discredit her by citing her background as a sex worker and time in a mental institution.

It is not the first legal case for the star. He was arrested for assaulting a fan in 2005, charged with disorderly conduct and resisting arrest in the same year, arrested for threatening someone with a gun in 2007 and involved in a lawsuit for assault and battery in 2012.

The Game initially broke out with hits such as How We Do, Hate It or Love It and Dreams, working with 50 Cent and Kanye West.

The Commons home affairs committee is to hold talks on the future direction of the independent inquiry into child sex abuse after receiving letters detailing the concerns of four senior lawyers who have quit the inquest.

A Home Office minister tried to reassure MPs on Monday that Prof Alexis Jay remains the right person to chair the troubled inquiry after the latest round of resignations and defections of survivors’ groups.

The Commons home affairs committee, chaired by Labour’s Yvette Cooper, is to meet in private on Tuesday to discuss the future of an inquiry that is now on its fourth chair, after the resignation of 17 lawyers and the withdrawal of several survivors’ groups.



The MPs are expected to order the publication later this week of letters from four barristers – including Hugh Davies QC, ex-deputy lead counsel to the inquiry – detailing their concerns over the conduct and management of the inquiry during the recent crises.

One of the letters is reported to repeat the allegations made by a Labour MP, Lisa Nandy, who used parliamentary privilege to name the senior counsel to the inquiry, Ben Emmerson, QC, as the person accused of an alleged sexual assault at the inquiry’s London headquarters. It is believed to criticise the inquiry’s handling of the sexual assault allegation.

Emmerson, who has been suspended from the inquiry, has denied the allegations as “categorically untrue” while the inquiry has said that no official complaint of sexual assault has been made.

The home affairs committee is not expected to call for the inquiry to be closed down but a clear cross-party statement calling for Jay to be replaced by a judge and for its scope to be scaled back could prove highly influential.

Nandy secured an urgent Commons question on Monday over the latest developments surrounding the inquiry including the withdrawal of the 600-strong Shirley Oaks survivors’ association – the largest group represented at the inquiry.

In their resignation statement on Friday the group, which represents survivors of child sex abuse at Shirley Oaks care home in Lambeth, south London, said the inquiry had become “an unpalatable circus which has stumbled and lurched from crisis to crisis”.

In the Commons, Sarah Newton, a junior Home Office minster, said the government remained confident that Jay was the right person to take it forward. She said that Shirley Oaks was only one of the victims’ groups represented at the inquiry and appealed to them to re-engage. “I am confident, as is the prime minister, as is the home secretary, in the ability of Professor Jay to lead this inquiry,” Newton told MPs. “She has a distinguished career in social work and a longstanding dedication to child protection.

“She led the independent inquiry into child sexual exploitation in Rotherham, where she scrutinised the work of social workers, and proved her capability to uncover failings across institutions and professions. She is the right person to take this work forward.”

But Nandy said it was the last chance for ministers to get a grip: “They have lost seven senior lawyers, three chairs and several survivors’ groups and it is now impossible to see that this inquiry is still [operating] effectively.

“This may be the last chance that the prime minister and her home secretary have to rescue the inquiry that she set up, from collapse. Will she now stop hiding behind the smokescreen of independence (and) recognise that she has responsibility for this inquiry’s success and get a grip on it?”

She found support from the shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, who said the inquiry’s independent status did not mean that the Home Office could take no responsibility at all and allow the inquiry to run into the sands.

Jim Killock, the executive director of the Open Rights Group, criticises the government’s plans to tackle children’s exposure to pornography on the internet by telling us that they will put the UK in the same bracket as Turkey and Saudi Arabia (Pornography sites face UK block under enhanced age controls, theguardian.com, 19 November).

If that were true – which it isn’t – we have been there since at least 2002, when the court of appeal made clear in R v Perrin that, absent age verification, pornography publishers on the internet were liable to prosecution.

However, since that decision there have been no cases, because all of the offending sites are based overseas. The government proposals are therefore simply a practical and pragmatic attempt to make it possible for our pre-existing laws to be enforced.

They will not interfere with any adult’s right to view pornography but they may detain someone for a few seconds while they prove they are over 18. A familiar and not a major hardship.

The UK’s most senior judge, Lord Neuberger, has announced he will retire next summer and signalled the launch of a judicial appointments process that could – through offering flexible working practices – improve diversity on the supreme court bench.

Confirming his departure, Neuberger, the president of the court, who is now 68, said that six new justices would be appointed over the next 18 months. 



There are normally 12 members of the supreme court. Only one, Lady Hale, the deputy president, is a woman. All are white. Only two of the present justices were not privately educated.



Criticism of the composition of the judiciary has been mounting due to the fact that there are still relatively few senior female judges and only five high court judges from ethnic minority backgrounds. The justice secretary, Liz Truss, has pledged to introduce measures to improve diversity on the benches.



In a speech to the Bar Council on Monday evening, Neuberger confirmed that he and Lord Clarke, another supreme court justice, would step down next summer. Lord Toulson retired in July but has not yet been replaced. Lords Hughes, Mance and Sumption will leave in 2018.

In an attempt to improve diversity, Neuberger said there would be half-day “insight sessions” offered to prospective candidates where they would be given a tour of the court, allowed to spend time observing proceedings, and offered a private meeting with a current supreme court justice.

The appointments will be in two batches of three positions each, to improve the chances of recruiting from a wider background. Information on “flexible working” would be offered in the job information pack for the first time.

Neuberger said that he and Hale “wanted to have two composite recruitment competitions, one starting early next year to recruit three new justices, and the other starting in the first half of 2018 to recruit another three new justices”. 



“This has the advantages of much better use of time,” he said, “and much less of a burden on candidates. Even more importantly, it improves the prospect of a more diverse and more coherent recruitment to the court.

“The higher echelons of the judiciary in the United Kingdom suffer from a marked lack of diversity and here I must admit the supreme court does not score at all well. 



“We have one white woman and 10 white men, and, although two of the 11 were not privately educated, none of us come from disadvantaged backgrounds.” 



Candidates are chosen on merit, but where there are two candidates of an equal standard there is provision for the one from a less represented background to be the one selected.



The post of lord chief justice, currently held by Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd, is also likely to fall vacant next year. Judges have to retire at the age of 70 unless appointed before 1995.

Among the women whose names have been suggested as possible candidates for promotion is Lady Justice Hallett, an appeal court judge.



Welcoming Neuberger’s announcement, Truss said: “The supreme court makes an immense contribution to our constitution, hearing cases of the utmost importance that impact upon the entire population. It is right that such a crucial institution taps into all the talents of our country. 



“That is why I wholeheartedly support the steps the court is taking to introduce a more flexible and open appointment process for supreme court judges. I urge people with the right qualities from all backgrounds to apply for these important positions.”



The chairman of the bar, Chantal-Aimée Doerries QC, said: “The Bar Council and the bar will continue to support and work with the judiciary to raise awareness of judicial career opportunities to a wide talent pool, building on the substantial commitment we have made to ensure that the bar and the judiciary reflect more broadly the society they serve. 



“We already work closely with the Judicial Diversity Forum and the Judicial Appointments Commission. In addition, our existing Bar Mentoring Service is available to support those seeking judicial appointments from the bar. There is more to be done, and a collective effort from the bar, judiciary, lord chancellor and other parts of the legal sector will be essential to making a difference.”

In your article (High court sends 10,000 prison officers back to work after justice secretary acts, 16 November), the head of the National Offender Management Service, Michael Spurr, was reported as saying that prisoners were not being unlocked, creating a dangerous situation.

Prisoners not being unlocked is nothing new. In its 2014 report on HMP Isis, to take one example, the prison inspectorate had to recommend that prisoners be able to spend “a reasonable amount of time” out of their cells. Its 2016 report found that this had not been achieved and noted that 40% of prisoners were locked up during the core day (as well as from early evening till the morning) and that the regime had been “punitively restricted for several years”.

The cause is not one day of action by prison officers, but staffing cuts imposed by the coalition government, and the failure of the current administration to address the increasingly dangerous situation across the prison system.

• Michael Gove, in his Longford lecture (Report, theguardian.com, 18 November), complained about the state of our prisons caused by lack of funding. Can it be that he has forgotten that he was, until recently, the justice secretary; that he seemed ideally placed to deal with the scandalous conditions in the prisons, including the suicide rate of inmates; and that he deserted his responsibility there in order to join Farage/Johnson bandwagon?

Had he continued with the vital work on the prisons he would still be respected. As it is, he and the three Brexit ministers should be forced to face the impossible task they have set themselves, and the ignominy that awaits them when it is acknowledged that they cannot both have the European cake and eat it.

• Your editorial (Taking control of prisons starts by freeing those held for too long, 18 November) is spot-on. Prisoners not having release dates benefits nobody, causes problems for their eventual rehabilitation into society, and is costing the taxpayer needless expense.

We need to keep up the pressure to stop indefinite detention for immigration purposes too. People are detained without any time limit, more and more are being detained for years. The UK is one of the few countries in the world that does not have a time limit on depriving people of their freedom, and we should be ashamed of this. Detention like this also achieves no purpose, wastes lives, and wastes money.

A senior former manager is suing the Crown Prosecution Service for unfair and constructive dismissal in an employment claim that has exposed strains in the way cases are brought to trial.

Lynne Townley, a barrister who worked for the CPS for 12 years, is alleging that she was not supported when dealing with other prosecutors, in particular one who dealt with high profile cases at the Old Bailey whom she alleged was “woefully inadequate”.

Her claim before the central London employment tribunal has revealed clashes behind the legal scenes at a time when the service is under funding pressure.

Townley, who left the CPS last year, was described by John Hardy QC, who is representing her, as having had a “glittering career”, including acting as a legal adviser to NHS England and holding visiting professorships at several overseas universities.

Among her responsibilities, however, was managing a prosecutor whom, the tribunal was told, was later dismissed, reinstated and downgraded. “[This lawyer] was saddled with cases of considerable complexity,” Hardy said. “He was woefully inadequate and … an employee who was simply unmanageable.

“There is a question of what backup [Townley] received. We would characterise the senior management as paralysed by indecision and displaying all the characteristics of institutional cowardice. What happened to Ms Townley was that she was given sticking plasters to cover gaping wounds. [She] was a prize employee who should have been treasured by the CPS. But she was threatened over her sickness absence over [this fiasco].”

The dismissed CPS lawyer was removed for gross misconduct as the result of a case at the central criminal court, Hardy said, following “scathing criticism from the police officer in the case.” He was later offered reinstatement. Townley, Hardy said, ended up facing dismissal and being refused any compensation. 



Saul Margo, the barrister representing the CPS, said the issue was whether the dismissed CPS lawyer was not just “difficult but impossible to manage”. He was being effectively managed by the claimant, Margo said. What was behind the case, he said, was the fact that Townley had twice sought to make use of the early, voluntary release scheme. “She asked for severance from the service and a financial offer,” he said.

The dismissed CPS lawyer was not impossible to manage, Margo said. She did manage him. “The last straw argument doesn’t work,” he said

A judge who used to work at the CPS is due to give evidence in the case this week. The employment judge, Anthony Snelson, said although the case had begun, it was not too late for the parties to reconsider settling rather than continuing “taking lumps out of each other”.

Lawyers challenging the government’s right to trigger Britain’s exit from the European Union without a vote in the House of Commons are to invoke a “radical revolutionary tradition” enshrined in Scottish law for more than 300 years.

The Independent Workers Union of GB, which was set up to represent workers in the so-called gigeconomy, has told the supreme court that the government would be in breach of Scottish constitutional law if it were to trigger article 50 without Westminster’s agreement.

The IWGB has hired the constitutional lawyer Aidan O’Neill QC, who has challenged the UK government’s claim that it has the prerogative to trigger article 50 without a parliamentary vote in his submission.

Echoing the Scottish government’s case to the court, O’Neill says that because leaving the EU involves each part of the UK, the court must take account of Scotland’ constitutional law and in particular the Claim of Right Act 1689, signed the year after England’s weaker Bill of Rights was drafted. It codified the “radical revolutionary tradition” in Scotland that a monarch was always answerable to the law and the people, in this case its parliaments, he says.

O’Neill says the court must also take contemporary issues into account, such as the rights of EU migrant workers and trade union members the IWGB represents.

The UK government is expected to vigorously contest these arguments in next month’s hearing, but they add to the increasingly complex legal battle over Brexit.

Theresa May’s government has confirmed it would not be shifting its position on whether article 50 could ever be reversed, despite speculation of a U-turn.



In its skeleton argument (pdf)released last Friday, the attorney general, Jeremy Wright QC, and other lawyers on the government’s legal team state: “Before the [high court] it was common ground between the parties that an article 50 notification is irrevocable and cannot be given conditionally ... [The supreme] court is invited to do the same.”



The Scottish and Welsh governments have already been allowed to take part in the action, which was brought by Gina Miller, an investment manager, and Deir Dos Santos, a hairdresser, increasing the scope of the case.

In a further development on Monday, it emerged that Northern Ireland’s attorney general, John Larkin QC, is now expected now to take part in the hearing, increasing the chances that the cross-border deal with the Republic of Ireland in the Good Friday agreement will also become part of the legal argument.

Mick Antoniw, counsel general for the Welsh government, said the future of the UK’s devolution framework was at stake. “The attorney general for Northern Ireland will appear before this court because he is a party to that claim [which] raises such important issues for the devolution framework in the United Kingdom as a whole,” he said.

Scotland’s chief law officer has also been asked to address the 11 supreme court judges on specific areas of Scottish law that are affected by Brexit. In a brief submission to the court, the lord advocate, James Wolffe QC, said the claim of right made “a unilateral act of the crown” on this issue unlawful.

O’Neill’s submission argues: “The contemporary significance and resonance of this Scottish tradition is clear in the present case. In effect, the Scottish constitutional tradition is not that the crown has plenipotentiary imperial prerogative ‘Henry VIII’ powers unless and until these are expressly limited by parliament.

“Rather the Scottish constitutional tradition is that the crown, the government, only has such powers as are expressly granted to it by the people gathered together in a representative assembly.”

The Scottish government and O’Neill also raise the Sewel convention, a rule introduced at the time of Scottish and Welsh devolution in 1999, which says both devolved parliaments have to approve any act of Westminster that affects their powers.

Wolffe’s submission calls it a convention and so not a legally binding veto, but O’Neill goes further and says that because it is recent legislation, Sewel has legal force. If the supreme court agrees, that would effectively give the Scottish parliament a veto over the Brexit bill.

Aileen McHarg, a professor of public law at the University of Strathclyde, was sceptical about O’Neill’s arguments. She said he was right to argue that Scotland and England historically had different views about a monarch’s privileges, but that was not same as their powers.

O’Neill’s argument that the monarch could only act in this way with the explicit approval of a parliament was very unusual, she said. “This claim is not supported by any authority, and I have never before seen it suggested that there is any difference between Scots and English law in this regard,” she said.

If his arguments were accurate, then nothing done by the UK or Scottish government which uses prerogative powers would be lawful because they had no explicit legal authority to use them, she added.

British ministers have acted like overexcited cheerleaders for Bahrain’s woefully inadequate human rights reforms, Amnesty International has said, ahead of an expected visit next month by Theresa May on the sidelines of the annual Gulf Cooperation Council summit.

Ministers ought to be confronting the awkward reality that the institutions set up in Bahrain with UK support “are seriously flawed and widely seen as a PR exercises”, Amnesty said.

The report, based on 90 interviews with Bahraini human rights activists, said it is “utterly disingenuous” of the British government to pretend it is delivering substantial human rights reform in Bahrain.

There is controversy over the value and independence of two UK-supported human rights institutions. Britain also has longstanding military links with Bahrain and is establishing a new military base in the kingdom. The Foreign Office said the two institutions show the government in Manama is willing to respond to western pressure.

The bodies, the ombudsman of the ministry of interior and the special investigations unit within the public prosecution, were established in 2012 following a fierce crackdown by the Bahraini government on protests the previous year.

The then foreign secretary Philip Hammond said Bahrain had been making significant reform, telling the House of Commons it was “a country which is travelling in the right direction”.

However, Amnesty said the special investigations unit has failed to take prompt action to protect detainees from torture, investigate their allegations effectively or ensure their access to medical care.

It pointed out that although it was obvious Hussain Jawad, a prominent Bahraini human rights activist, was at risk of torture following his arrest in February 2015, the ombudsman’s office “failed to carry out a prompt visit to check the conditions of his detention”.

Jawad later said he was blindfolded, beaten with his hands cuffed behind his back and threatened with sexual abuse in order to extract a confession.

Amnesty also said the ombudsman’s office delayed an investigation for two years into the torture allegations of Mohamed Ramadhan, an airport security guard sentenced to death after being convicted of involvement in a bomb attack, despite receiving information from his family and an international NGO.

The special investigations unit has prosecuted 93 members of the security forces, but only 15 low-ranking officials have been convicted, Amnesty noted. No senior officers or officials who oversaw the serious human rights violations during the 2011 uprising have faced prosecution.

Out of nearly 200 cases Amnesty has recorded since the uprising, fewer than 45 have been referred to trial. The organisation pointed out that neither human rights body has gained the public’s trust, partly as a result of a perceived lack of independence and impartiality.

Both are viewed as being too close to the interior ministry and other government institutions, and having failed to keep families and victims adequately informed of progress in their investigations.

In the most widely known case, Nabeel Rajab is facing up to 15 years in prison for free speech offences that include writing an article critical of the government in the New York Times.

Amnesty International UK’s head of policy and government affairs, Allan Hogarth, said: “It was a welcome move when Bahrain set up these two bodies back in 2012, but it’s utterly disingenuous of the UK government to pretend they’re delivering substantial human rights reform in Bahrain.

“Instead of acting as overexcited cheerleaders for Bahrain’s woefully inadequate reforms, UK ministers ought to be confronting the awkward reality that these UK-backed institutions are seriously flawed and widely seen as a PR tool of the Bahraini government.”

Amnesty said authorities have placed severe restrictions on the right of Bahrainis to participate in demonstrations and other forms of peaceful assembly. There is an indefinite ban on all public demonstrations in the capital.

The security forces regularly disperse unauthorised protests, which mostly occur in Shia villages when protesters demand the release of political prisoners, sometimes using excessive force including teargas and shotgun pellets, it said.

Riot officers have been sent into a prison to deal with a disturbance, the government has confirmed, only two weeks after as many as 200 prisoners were involved in a riot at another facility.

Sunday’s news comes after prison officers were ordered by a judge to abandon a planned strike over an increase in violence in a system they said was in meltdown.

The Ministry of Justice confirmed that its Tornado team, prison officers trained to quell riots, had been ordered into HMP Moorland, near Doncaster – a category C prison, and dealt with a situation involving about 10 prisoners in the early hours of Monday.

A Prison Service spokeswoman later said: “Specially trained staff have successfully resolved an isolated incident involving a small number of prisoners on one wing at HMP Moorland.

“We are absolutely clear that prisoners who behave in this way will be punished and could spend significantly longer behind bars.”

Earlier, she said some prisoners had been removed from the wing but was unable to say exactly how many, nor was she able to give any further detail on the nature of the disturbance.

Two weeks ago, the Prison Service was forced to launch an investigation after a riot at Bedford prison took officers six hours to bring under control. An inspection of the facility in September found that conditions had fallen to “unacceptable levels”, with prisoners easily able to get hold of illegal drugs.

Last week, the Prison Officers’ Association and the justice secretary, Liz Truss, agreed to reopen talks after the high court’s order that the union’s proposed 24-hour strike involving up to 10,000 staff be called off.

The POA had said that a “continued surge in violence and unprecedented levels of suicide and acts of self-harm ... demonstrate that the service is in meltdown”.

The report on Amber Rudd not actually reading the evidence (11 November) held by South Yorkshire police on its operation at Orgreave during the 1984 miners’ strike, and the subsequent collapsed prosecutions, reflects the contempt and lack of respect that the government has had for the Orgreave Truth and Justice Campaign (OTJC). In her letter to the OTJC explaining her decision not to grant an independent public inquiry she states: “I am satisfied that policing today is now very different from how it was in 1984 ... I am of the view that in light of ... reforms and changes there would be very few, if any, lessons for the policing system today to be gleaned from reviewing the events and practices of 1984.” But the actual detailed evidence accumulated by the campaign surely points to the contrary. Furthermore, the acquittal of 10 of the Rotherham 12 (Report, 17 November), arrested by South Yorkshire police while defending their communities against racist attacks, shows that policing and police tactics have not changed at all. There is surely now an even more urgent need for an inquiry into Orgreave as well as policing in Rotherham.

Vital interrogation of the science behind cryogenically freezing humans is being stifled because scientists fear being ostracised and ridiculed, according to a leading researcher in the field.



The cryobiologist Ramon Risco said scientists risked damaging their careers and being excluded from scientific societies if they worked on cryonics, the controversial science used last month to freeze the body of a 14-year-old cancer victim.

“There is an enormous ‘stigma bias’ to the conversation about cryonics among scientists,” said Risco, who works on the cryopreservation of large human organs and tumour biopsies at the CryoBioTech cryobiology laboratory at the University of Seville. “For scientists who would like to discuss it open-mindedly it tends to significantly hurt their career – in fact can potentially even get them kicked out of their scientific societies.”

The claim comes after the father of the teenage girl, who was granted her dying wish to have her body cryogenically frozen, accused those who provide the service of taking advantage of vulnerable people.



The high court upheld the wishes of the teenager, known only as JS, who decided before her death from cancer that she wanted her body to be preserved in the hope that she could be brought back to life at a later time. Her estranged father initially opposed her wishes but changed his mind saying it was “the last and only thing she has asked from me”.

But in an interview with the Mail on Sunday, he said that after discussions with the Cryonics Institute in Detroit, where his daughter’s body is stored, he remained strongly opposed.

“I believe they are selling false hope to those who are frightened of dying, taking advantage of vulnerable people,” he said. “When I asked if there was even a one in a million chance of my daughter being brought back to life, they could not say there was.”

But Risco argued that cryonics could not be dismissed solely as science fiction, and said it was likely that in five to 10 years experts would be able to revive a small mammal such as a mouse after it had been preserved in liquid nitrogen.

“It is very risky to say that anything is impossible in science or technology in the 21st century – people who use the word impossible are very brave,” he said. “If you are looking for the truth, why would you put barriers up?”



Risco also founded a start up, SafePreservation which enables customers to cryopreserve their biological material.

Prof Anders Sandberg, a research fellow at the Future of Humanity Institute at Oxford University, said scientists reliant on grants and looking for tenures might exercise self-censorship. “Many young scientists are afraid to hurt their careers,” he said. “Talking about the future can be very career-limiting. Being seen to be eccentric in the wrong way is frowned upon.”



Cryonics enthusiasts argue that the stigma surrounding the area could leave people vulnerable to unscrupulous companies ready to fill the void left by science.

Tim Gibson of the non-profit group Cryonics UK, which prepared the 14-year-old’s body for transportation to the freezing facility in Michigan, said the group, all of whose staff are volunteers, would welcome regulation.

“The danger for us is that as the idea gets more publicity, companies wanting to make a profit could spring up and damage us by [taking advantage of clients],” he said.

The judge who ruled on the 14-year-old’s case was critical of how the process had been carried out, stating: “The voluntary organisation is said to have been under-equipped and disorganised, resulting in pressure being placed on the hospital to allow procedures that had not been agreed.”

Gibson disputed that, saying body preparation and freezing had been done “within the law and required protcols” despite a “mechanical failure” which meant an ambulance used by the group was substituted by a van.



Gibson said the group’s Facebook page membership had increased by 25%, to around 400, since Friday. “The phone has not stopped ringing and I have about 200 emails to answer,” he said.



Clive Coen, a professor of neuroscience at King’s College London, has called for a ban on the marketing of cryonics. He said the idea of preserving a whole body was “ridiculous” and a whole brain “only slightly less ridiculous”.

The cosmologist and astrophysicist Martin Rees said he did not believe research was being stifled. “There are serious people working on it and they are aware that, though embryos can be preserved, it’s immensely unlikely that it would ever work for humans,” said Rees. “But even if it were a desirable development – and I actually think it wouldn’t be – most serious scientists would choose not to work on it because they don’t think the problem is timely or tractable.”

But those interested in the area who were hopeful that scientific developments could see the reanimation of humans who had been cryogenically frozen would continue to work under the radar, said Risco.



He added that “unconventional concepts” such as in vitro fertilisation, space travel and organ transplantation had all suffered “initial bias”.

“We don’t need to start making a big polemic,” he said. “We will keep on working on organ cryopreservation, no one will call us crazy and eventually we will end up with a solution for the whole body.”

The Serious Fraud Office will on Monday ask a London employment tribunal to hear an unfair dismissal claim by a former senior banker at Barclays in private.

The attempt to deter reporting of the case will be challenged by a number of news outlets – including the Guardian – and comes as the SFO continues its investigation into Barclays’ emergency cash call during the 2008 banking crisis.

The unfair dismissal case is being brought by Richard Boath, who until March was chairman of financial services at Barclays and has been interviewed by the SFO as part of its long-running investigation.

Few details about his claim are known although he is reported to be making the case under whistleblower protection laws. This means the potential payout is unlimited, unlike the £78,000 cap that applies to tribunals.

The SFO said it was “seeking orders that the hearings be held in private so as to preserve the confidentiality of the claimant’s interview by the SFO, and that there should be corresponding restrictions on the publication of such matters”. It added that an alternative would be “for the parties not [to] be permitted to refer to the contents of the claimant’s interview by the SFO in these proceedings”.

The SFO has said it will decide by March 2017 whether to bring charges in connection to the events in 2008 when Barclays avoided a taxpayer bailout by raising £7bn from investors, including in the Middle East.

The bank is contesting a £50m fine by the City regulator in relation to the fundraising during which the Financial Conduct Authority said it “acted recklessly” over the disclosure of £322m of fees paid to Qatar Holdings. The FCA penalty has been put on hold while the SFO continues its investigation, which Barclays has previously said includes its ex-finance director Chris Lucas.

Barclays has said it disclosed this fee arrangement in the first fundraising in June 2008, but not in the following one in October 2008.

The SFO had raised the possibility last year of offering Barclays a deferred prosecution agreement, which would require cooperation from companies that in turn need to admit to offences, although this appears to have come to nothing.

Barclays declined to comment ahead of the tribunal. It is contesting a £721m claim by Amanda Staveley – a financier who helped the bank find billions of pounds during 2008 – who argues she should have received fees for being involved in the the crucial financings.

A leading Republican voice on national security matters says he doesn’t care what president-elect Donald Trump says, the United States will not reinstate waterboarding.

Senator John McCain of Arizona, chairman of the armed services committee, said on Saturday that any attempt to bring back harsh tortures such as waterboarding, which simulates drowning, would quickly be challenged in court.

“I don’t give a damn what the president of the United States wants to do or anybody else wants to do. We will not waterboard. We will not do it,” McCain said to applause during a panel discussion at the Halifax international security forum.

McCain, who was tortured as a prisoner of war during the Vietnam War, said extreme interrogation techniques are banned under US law and the Geneva conventions.

During the campaign, Trump said he would push to change laws that prohibit waterboarding, which was used against suspected terrorists during the George W Bush administration.

McCain, the 2008 Republican presidential nominee, said waterboarding didn’t work and made it hard for the US to claim moral superiority.

“What does it say about America if we’re going to inflict torture on people?” he asked.

McCain also expressed support for the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico and said the United States should not back out of the not-yet-implemented Trans-Pacific Partnership. As a candidate, Trump said Nafta should be renegotiated and opposed the TPP, arguing that such trade agreements cause significant job losses in the US.

“I think we are going to pay a terrible price for abandoning the TPP,” McCain said.

“You are going to see Chinese assertion of economic influence in the region, and possible dominance. All of these countries are now going to join with China in trade agreements and we’re going to be out in the cold.

“Historians will judge us very harshly.”

‘London, that great cesspool into which all the loungers and idlers of the Empire are irresistibly drained” was what Sherlock Holmes’s companion, Dr Watson, thought of the capital. Well, this week a cross-party coalition of MPs will be trying to drain the mire of its dirtiest elements.

The government’s criminal finances bill, with its crackdown on unexplained foreign wealth, secretive shell companies and high-level tax evasion, is a smart attempt to end London’s culture of money-laundering. But if we are really going to stop the capital’s property being used as a reserve currency by global kleptocrats, we have to go further. For London’s historic place at the heart of the empire has endowed it with the networks and skills, from the Square Mile to Caribbean tax havens, to become one of the world’s leading hubs for the dispersal and camouflaging of dubious funds.

In the late 19th century, as the scramble for Africa extended the British empire, London’s banks and accountancy firms funnelled cash around the colonies. Joseph Chamberlain called the City “the clearing-house of the world”, financing mining in New South Wales and tea plantations in India. In EM Forster’s Howards End, Henry Wilcox is said to have the “colonial spirit” as he successfully enriches himself at the Imperial and West Africa Rubber Company. With the capital flowed the ships and steamers out of the Thames, sitting on board one of which was Joseph Conrad’s traumatised Marlow, with his Congo tales of venturing “into the heart of an immense darkness”.

The National Crime Agency says up to £90bn is laundered through the UK each year, while an estimated £120bn worth of UK property is owned by offshore shell companies. Some 75% of properties whose owners are under investigation for corruption made use of offshore corporate secrecy to hide their identities. And according to the director of the National Crime Agency, “the London property market has been skewed by laundered money. Prices are being artificially driven up by overseas criminals who want to sequester their assets here in the UK.”

Those assets are far too often being extracted from developing nations desperately in need of tax revenues. A century on from Heart of Darkness, the Democratic Republic of the Congo still ranks near the bottom of the UN Human Development Index, with one in seven children dead before the age of five. And, as in Conrad’s time, London’s imperial connections are helping to facilitate the exploitation of this asset-rich nation. Diamond and mineral wealth is being extracted by political elites, funnelled via London to old remnants of empire in the overseas territories, then repatriated via Kensington townhouses back to the UK. Our financial, accountancy and property agents are the beneficiaries, the people of the DRC and househunters of London the losers.

When the Panama Papers revealed the extent of global tax haven exploitation, the government responded with the criminal finances bill. It introduces unexplained wealth orders to unearth the sources of suspect assets, gives crime agencies more time to investigate complex networks behind shell companies and goes after companies that assist with criminally facilitating tax evasion. I want to do more, with amendments that urge the publication of a list of UK property held by foreign companies so we can find out the real owners. We need companies convicted of a failure to prevent tax evasion to be excluded from public procurement. And I am supporting an annual parliamentary report on unexplained wealth orders so we create a culture change at the top of government.

We are told that much of London’s success is because of its unimpeachable legal system and absence of corruption. But that is no good if, under the banner of the rule of law, we are also aiding and abetting exploitation.

In Surrey mansions and Mayfair sit the lost wealth, the never-built hospitals and unopened schools of too many developing nations. London still houses the loungers and idlers of empire, growing rich from the spoils of exploitation. It is time today’s Sherlocks had the tools they need to straighten out the City’s finances.

A campaign to push for abortion to be removed from the justice statutes and decriminalised is to be launched this month by the country’s newest political party.

Sophie Walker, leader of the non-partisan Women’s Equality party, said it was time that abortion was made a sexual health and human rights issue, rather than left languishing under “Victorian criminal law”, where a life prison sentence still exists for procuring a termination. This is a flagship policy for the party, which will hold its first conference in Manchester next weekend. It hopes that with pressure from its supporters, other political parties will take up the issue.

The current legislation governing abortion is the 1861 Offences Against the Person Act, which came into force decades before women had the vote.

Abortion is part of life in mainland Britain: one in three women will have an abortion before the age of 45, with the highest rate among 21-year-olds. Rates have remained fairly constant over the past few years, higher in England and Wales than in Scotland, with 197,906 Britons and 5,190 non-British residents having an abortion last year. About 98% are NHS-funded and the vast majority, 80%, carried out at less than 10 weeks pregnant.

Under the 1861 act, and as amended by the Abortion Act 1967, abortion remains a criminal offence; only cases that meet certain caveats are exempt from prosecution. Two doctors must sign to confirm that a woman’s or her unborn child’s health and welfare is at risk, resulting, say campaigners, in the law simply being circumvented in many cases. And it is also open to political interference. The British Pregnancy Advisory Service believes the rules work only because health professionals work around them.

The WE party has grown to more than 65,000 members and 65 regional groups since its inception last year. It fielded its first political candidates at local and regional elections this year, including for the London mayor.

“This is really about making it very clear that women’s healthcare rights are human rights,” said Walker. “That is why we want to debate this motion at our first conference and to put a focus on prioritising and funding sexual health and wellbeing. If you are denied control over your own body then you are denied so many other controls over your life. Any denial of reproductive rights is a form of violence against women, and the massive funding cuts ongoing in the UK are part of a real trend that is de-prioritising equality.”

Former Progressive Unionist party leader Dawn Purvis is on the advisory board of Marie Stopes International, which provides contraception and safe abortion services. She is to give a keynote speech at the WE party conference on the position in Northern Ireland, where several prosecutions are under way of women who have used the so-called “abortion pill”.

“The situation in Northern Ireland is different to mainland Britain in that, basically, a woman has to be about to die before she is allowed a termination,” Purvis said. “Rape or incest or foetal abnormality are not circumstances under which an abortion will be allowed. We’re seeing women being prosecuted and convicted as criminals – one was reported by her GP after she had gone to him for help, another is a woman being prosecuted for helping her daughter.

“But thankfully we are seeing more and more legal challenges – late last year we had a ruling that the stance of the Ministry of Justice was incompatible with international standards on human rights.”

Diana Johnson, Labour MP for Kingston upon Hull North, has tabled a 10-minute bill for the spring when she will also raise the issue of decriminalising abortion. She does not want to change time limits but wants medical procedures to be governed by clinicians, rather than the criminal law.

“That any woman procuring an abortion is potentially facing a prison sentence of life under legislation dating from 1861 is patently something that needs looking at carefully,” she said. “Decriminalising abortion, for both health professionals and for women, would put the issue with clinicians and health experts, where it belongs.”

Senior Tories have urged Theresa May to scrap the government’s appeal against a high court ruling which states that parliament must vote on leaving the EU.



Oliver Letwin, the former head of the government’s Brexit preparations, has called on the prime minister to abandon its supreme court appeal over the decision on article 50, the mechanism that triggers exit negotiations.

The former attorney general Dominic Grieve and former solicitor-general Sir Edward Garnier also said May should avoid taking the case to the UK’s highest court.

The three Conservatives, who all supported the remain campaign, said they wanted the process to start as soon as possible with a bill in parliament.

Garnier told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Saturday: “That way you avoid an unnecessary legal row, you avoid a lot of unnecessary expense, but you also avoid an opportunity for ill-motivated people to attack the judiciary, to misconstrue the motives of both parties to the lawsuit, and you provide certainty.”

Letwin, a former minister who was director of the “Brexit unit” after the referendum, said avoiding the supreme court would avert the risk of judges granting veto powers to devolved administrations.

Grieve told Today the government’s chances of success at the supreme court hearing, scheduled to start on 5 December, were low. “I can’t see the point in the government continuing with the case and also agree that if they enact primary legislation, they will get it through parliament,” he said.

Three high court judges ruled on 3 November that the prime minister does not have the power to trigger article 50 on her own. The government quickly announced that it would appeal against the decision.

A spokesman for the Department for the Exit of the European Union said: “The country voted to leave the European Union in a referendum approved by an act of parliament and the government is determined to respect that result.

“We will robustly defend our position in the forthcoming appeal. As the prime minister made clear [on Friday], our work is on track and we remain committed to triggering article 50 by the end of March next year.”

The Tory former education secretary Nicky Morgan backed the calls for May to drop the case.

Morgan, a prominent remain supporter, told LBC radio: “I think it would be a good thing if the government did abandon the appeal to the supreme court and they got on with a short act of parliament, so parliament can get on with saying yes to the government triggering article 50.

“We can get on then with negotiating the terms on which we are going to leave, the terms on which we are going to continue to have a relationship with the EU going forward.”

The former Scottish first minister Alex Salmond said the Tories’ comments showed their contempt for Scotland’s rights.

The SNP’s Europe spokesman said: “Sir Oliver Letwin and co have now blurted out the true blue Tory attitude towards Scotland. They would even rather abandon the Brexit appeal than take any chance of the supreme court being sensitive to Scottish European concerns.

“Every Tory in Scotland should cringe with embarrassment as the Tory contempt for Scotland’s rights as a nation has been laid bare. The trouble for the Tories in Scotland is that their Westminster colleagues have been caught telling the truth about their anti-Scottish prejudices.”

Two years ago, my partner and I finally wrote proper wills. The basic instructions for guardianship of our young children, written years before, were no longer fit-for-purpose. We were prompted by Will Aid, a charitable scheme that runs every November. It was hard to resist its logic: it is irresponsible not to sort out your affairs and, doing it this way, solicitors waive their fees and instead you make a charitable donation. This was compelling, but it was surprisingly hard to get round to doing, which might explain why half the UK population don’t have valid wills.

Part of my reluctance, including superstitions that disaster would follow my writing it, was typical, according to Will Aid’s research. But my partner and I had also had experiences of wills stirring up uncomfortable emotions. My father, with no property to dispense, bequeathed me his chaotic stamp collection. It reminded me of his last, sad years and I hid it away until finally disposing of it. Badly. For years, I felt I’d let him down. My partner’s experience was more pointed – an unsatisfactory letter from his mother explaining her decision to leave her house to stepchildren and grandchildren rather than her sons.

Once I started asking around, I found that surprising numbers of people have had experiences of wills that left them puzzled or, as in the case of Paul Rodgers, still upset after 20 years. Paul, in his 40s, is a successful professional living in London, who received a financial legacy when his grandfather died. But his grandfather delivered a wounding blow with his last wishes.

Paul’s grandfather, David, was a big figure in his early life. “Big in every sense,” says Paul. “He was a dominant personality. He was brilliant. He’d been to a top university and was a national bridge champion. He was involved in early work in PR, which really took off in America in the 40s and 50s. He was a smart, funny person. I admired him.” Paul knew his grandfather had a cruel side; he’d witnessed him philandering and seen him putting down his son, Paul’s father. But since Paul’s relationship with his own father was difficult, he saw his grandfather as an ally.

“My father was also very bright, but he was one of those people who couldn’t quite make it. His life had never really come together. He had never managed to have a good career, he never finished his degree, and he sometimes had to ask his father for money. He was charming but he had a horrible temper. We were never violently treated but, emotionally, we were scared of him. It was kind of fun to have someone put him in his place.”

This view of his grandfather as an ally and idol was shattered on his death. Paul, by then living in London, was summoned back to the US when his grandfather became ill, joining family members at the bedside. The day after he died, the family found his will and a letter requesting that it should be read by Paul, who was named as executor.

Paul now regrets that he didn’t read it first. “I started reading it out to my family and you don’t know from the first sentence where it’s going. And I couldn’t stop reading it. What do you do? I’m quite dutiful. So I probably just felt I’ve been told to read this letter so I’ll just read it. If it was now, I might not do that.” The letter was addressed to his son, Paul’s father, “basically telling him what a fuck-up he was all his life, how little respect he had for him every step of the way. It was just the cruellest thing you can imagine. It was a chronicle of my father’s failings. ‘You have been a disappointment. You have borrowed money from me. Your life has been a mess.’ The tone was nasty in a clinical way.”

Paul still lives with a sense of guilt that his grandfather recruited him to wound his own father like this from beyond the grave. But if his grandfather felt Paul would enjoy a shared role in delivering this blow, he miscalculated. Paul couldn’t stop himself reading the letter, but his mind was in revolt. “I remember my father sitting there quietly, stoically, listening to this letter and not doing anything. The only thing my father said was, ‘Well, there you are then.’ In an instant, my opinion of my grandfather changed from being funny, brilliant, smart, talented, and often generous, to being cruel. Simple. One word. Cruel.”

Paul thinks that his grandfather’s motivation was pure spite. “He and his wife were both vain and narcissistic. He had an image and he wanted everything a certain way.” Paul thinks a sense of entitlement and power reinforced this narcissism. They wanted their children to be in their image. “He was just so talented if they didn’t meet his expectations he was perpetually disappointed.”

Mark Accettura, author of Blood and Money, mentions narcissism as one of the personality disorders that underlie spiteful “toxic wills” and last letters. “I used to believe naively that inheritance fights were instigated by greedy heirs,” he says. “I had fallen into the trap of blaming the living and pardoning the dead. Over time I began to appreciate that in many, if not most, cases, the decedent himself or herself was a central part of the problem: they just weren’t physically present to fight over the mess they had a hand in creating.”

Occasionally, bad behaviour on the part of the deceased is recognised for what it is. In 2014 – unusually given a cornerstone of British law is the right to leave your property to whomever you wish – a judge found in favour of Heather Ilot, who challenged her mother’s will. Melita Jackson had explicitly disinherited Heather, leaving considerable property to animal charities. Their conflict had started when Heather was 17 and ran away with her boyfriend, whom Melita disapproved of. Melita never forgave her even though Heather went on to marry Nicholas who is still her husband and father of their five children. The judge accepted the barrister’s description of Melita as an “unreasonable, capricious and harsh mother”.

Denise Jones runs Lovingly Managed, a company of bereavement coordinators. She says that surprising numbers of people seem set on creating emotional havoc, either because they are not clear about their wishes or because they are engaging in emotional warfare. “I come across a lot of people disinheriting their children. It’s often because the kids don’t bother with them and usually because there’s been a huge falling out and they don’t speak any more. One person said, ‘I’d rather give to the dog’s home than let that bitch get it.’ Sometimes it’s because the child has married someone they don’t like. I also get quite a few people wanting to give it to their neighbours because they feel their children have neglected them.”

Jones thinks the potential for wills to cause havoc has increased. Because of house price increases, the higher value of estates tempts damaged people to use wills as weapons in a fight. Higher values also make those disinherited more inclined to challenge wills and with increasing numbers of stepfamilies, the chances of wills being inadequate to the situation escalate. People don’t realise, she says, “that when someone remarries that immediately invalidates other wills”. This means biological children can end up cut out of any inheritance. “Step-parents say, ‘Oh no! My kids would never do that,’” says Jones, “until it comes to cold hard cash.”

Wills and last wishes letters are the final words from the dead, written when people contemplate their own end and are swayed by strong feelings about their relationships with children and family, about who needs help and who doesn’t, about how they want to be remembered. Wills are emotional documents as much as financial and practical ones and thus have the potential for creating havoc and distress if unclear or used as weapons.

Jones doesn’t see her role as stopping people doing what they want with their money, but she does gently say, “Don’t you think it would be a good idea to leave some to a blood relation? Even if you don’t leave it to the children, perhaps there’s a grandchild, because being disinherited leaves a legacy of pain.”

Wills aren’t often discussed openly. But Jones thinks more openness might help people think clearly about what they are doing and the consequences. “I’m cynical about human nature,” she says and “anything could go wrong” in terms of respecting the wishes of the deceased or the havoc created by a vicious will. “I don’t want to scare people, but I explain all the worse-case scenarios and how to avoid them by thinking through what the end result will be.”

The father of a 14-year-old girl whose remains have been frozen after a high court judge’s ruling said he last saw his daughter alive nine years ago and did not get to view her body before it was cryogenically preserved.

The teenager, who died on 17 October, was terminally ill and had wanted her remains to be frozen in the hope she could be revived in the future.

But her divorced parents became embroiled in a dispute relating to whether her remains should be taken to a specialist facility in the United States and cryogenically frozen.

The girl, who lived in the London area with her mother and had a rare form of cancer, had taken legal action.

She had asked Mr Justice Peter Jackson to rule that her mother – who supported her wish to be cryogenically preserved – should be the only person allowed to make decisions about the disposal of her body.

Ultimately, Mr Justice Jackson made the ruling she wanted following a private hearing in the family division of the high court in London shortly before she died.

But speaking to the Telegraph, the girl’s father spoke of his sadness and blamed his former partner for stopping him seeing the child’s body before it was embalmed and frozen.

The man, who is also suffering from cancer, said: “Last time I saw her was in 2007. The reason for this is purely her mother’s doing – she said ‘no way, full stop’. She has caused this sadness between me and my daughter and she died in the end without me being able to see her.”

The girl’s solicitor, Zoe Fleetwood, said Jackson had ruled on a dispute between parents, not on people’s rights to have their remains frozen.

Fleetwood, a partner at the Dawson Cornwell law firm, said the teenager had described Jackson as her hero after learning of his decision days before she died.

Jackson had said nothing about the case could be reported while the teenager was alive after she said media coverage would distress her. He said he had been moved by the “valiant way” in which she had faced her “predicament” and ruled no one involved could be identified, again in line with the girl’s wishes.

The teenager, who had been too ill to attend the court hearing, had been represented by lawyers and had written to the judge explaining she wanted a chance to “live longer”.

Jackson, who had also visited her in hospital, said the girl’s application was the only one of its kind to have come before a court in England and Wales – and probably anywhere else – and was an example of new questions science posed to lawyers.

Fleetwood told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Friday: “By 6 October, the girl knew that her wishes were going to be followed. That gave her great comfort. She had those last few days knowing that her wish was granted.”

Donald Trump has settled fraud lawsuits relating to Trump University for $25m, removing a legal headache despite having pledged to fight the cases to the bitter end.

Lawyers for the president-elect settled the three lawsuits on Friday, averting the prospect of him testifying in a courtroom showdown which threatened to reveal more troubling details about the now defunct real estate course.

New York’s attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, claimed vindication and victory for those “swindled” by the course.

“Donald Trump fought us every step of the way, filing baseless charges and fruitless appeals and refusing to settle for even modest amounts of compensation for the victims of his phony university,” Schneiderman said in a statement. “Today, that all changes. Today’s $25m settlement agreement is a stunning reversal by Donald Trump and a major victory for the over 6,000 victims of his fraudulent university.”

Every victim will receive restitution and the president-elect will pay up to $1m in penalties to the state of New York for violating state education laws, Schneiderman said. “The victims of Trump University have waited years for today’s result and I am pleased that their patience – and persistence – will be rewarded by this $25m settlement.”

Trump’s attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Under the deal the president-elect will reportedly not admit to any wrongdoing.

Former students who filed the suit said they were lured by false promises to pay up to $35,000 to learn Trump’s real estate investing “secrets” from his “hand-picked” instructors.

The casino owner-turned-Republican candidate denied the allegations and said he relied on others to manage the business.

Trump’s lawyers negotiated the settlement with Schneiderman, in New York, and law firms that brought two separate class action lawsuits regarding Trump University in California.

Of the $25m some $21m will help reimburse those involved in the California suits. Some $3m will go to those in New York not covered by the California lawsuits.

Trump catapulted the case into the election this summer by assailing Judge Gonzalo Curiel, the federal district court judge hearing the case. Trump called him a “hater”, a “total disgrace” and “biased”. “He is not doing the right thing … [He] happens to be, we believe, Mexican,” he told a rally in San Diego.

For a White House hopeful to attack a federal judge in such a way was unprecedented. And inaccurate. Curiel has Mexican heritage but is a US citizen born in Indiana.

GOP primary opponents, and later Hillary Clinton, used the lawsuits to bash Trump as a huckster.

Stung, he vowed in tweets, speeches and interviews to not settle. “I don’t settle lawsuits,” he told a rally in Arkansas. “Probably should have settled it, but I just can’t do that. Mentally I can’t do it. I’d rather spend a lot more money and fight it.”

However, his unexpected election victory put pressure on the president-elect, who is busy forming a cabinet, to end the distraction before his inauguration in January – and before the possible emergence of further damaging revelations.

The opening of 400 pages of the Trump University “playbook” to public scrutiny in June shone a light on the ruthless business practices the real estate mogul used to build his business empire.

Employees were told to get people to pile on credit card debt and to target their financial weaknesses in an attempt to sell them the high-priced real estate courses, especially the $34,995 Gold Elite three-day package.

The documents contained an undated “personal message” from Trump to new enrollees at the school: “Only doers get rich. I know that in these three packed days, you will learn everything to make a million dollars within the next 12 months.”

Staff were told to spend lunch breaks in sign-up seminars “planting seeds” in potential students’ minds about how their lives would not improve unless they joined the program. Staff were also told to ask them personal questions to discover weaknesses that could be exploited to help seal the deal.

Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond, said the settlement appeared to be a substantial victory for the plaintiffs. “Especially because Trump suggested that he never settled cases and derided others who did settle them.”

The looming move to the White House ratcheted up pressure, Tobias said. “It was not inevitable, but it would have been very difficult to create a new government and conduct this litigation, particularly if Trump had to testify. Merely postponing it until he was president would not have helped much as the job will consume him.”

In an unrelated case, Trump’s lawyers on Wednesday dropped a lawsuit he was pursuing in Florida about commercial air traffic over his Mar-a-Lago estate.

When Ireland voted for marriage equality it would be fair to say that many people across the world were a little surprised. I know in Ireland we see ourselves as a modern dynamic and innovative country which is at the forefront of the world’s digital and pharmaceutical industries, but across the world most people still think of Ireland as a deeply religious Catholic country, a land of churches and tradition. Indeed, it is still hard to find a Hollywood film where the priest does not have an Irish accent.

The truth, as is usually the case in life, is that a little bit of both images are true. Ireland is a religious country and has the second highest regular church attendance in Europe after Poland. It has found a way to marry dynamism and tradition.

So how could this country of deep faith so enthusiastically vote for marriage equality for lesbian and gay people and become the first country in the world to do so? The truth is we supported marriage equality not in spite of, but because of the values our faith raised each of us in.

The same is true in Australia. Poll after poll shows the majority of Australian people of faith are in favour of marriage equality. The old argument of gay versus God is bogus. It is not a choice of picking one or the other and the members of churches see that.

Most of our faiths are built on the foundation stones of respect, human dignity, the sanctity of the person and social justice. These values do not contradict same-sex marriage, rather they lead us to supporting it. Across Ireland and Australia many of the leading advocates for marriage equality are people of faith. Australia is undoubtedly more religiously diverse than Ireland but since I came here I have been struck by the amazing voices from every faith who are making the case for marriage equality through the prism of their faith.

Sadly, most of the time the loudest voices we hear from the hierarchy of our churches is one that is out of step with their flocks. It is a cold, strident and marginalising message about our lesbian and gay friends, family and neighbours that has done so much damage over the centuries. It is a tone that contradicts the values of love, compassion and dignity that most religious people adhere to in Australia today.

All too often we generalise about people including people of faith. We make the presumption that if someone is religious they must be against equality for lesbian and gay people. Nothing could be further from the truth. As lesbian and gay people we know all too well what it is like when people make negative generalisations about us. We must show real leadership in ensuring we do not do the same to others.

The remarkable journey towards equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people in Australia must not become a journey based on the defeat of religion but rather a journey that builds bridges between people of faith and LGBTI people. It must be a journey that allows people of faith to ask their genuine questions so they might become supporters and advocates of equality. A journey based on conversation, persuasion and the values we hold dear, not angry debates.

A journey we can and should all take together.

Cryonic freezing companies should be banned from marketing the technique to vulnerable people, according to a leading neuroscientist who said they were being sold a false hope that freezing their bodies would allow them to be brought back to life in the future.

Clive Coen, a professor of neuroscience at King’s College London, said the high court decision which allowed a dying 14-year-old girl to have her body cryogenically frozen could have the “unintended consequence … that a lot of people are going to think this is worth a punt”.

“Ethically it’s very complicated. The trade-off is that she got the comfort, but others may now be duped,” he added.



Coen said it would be a “sensible step” for the UK to consider following the example of the Canadian state of British Columbia which bans funeral homes from marketing cryonics – thought to be the only place with anti-cryonics laws in North America. “At the moment that seems a very sensible strategy,” he said.

He added: “There is no evidence outside amphibia and tissue slices that any of this works [...] We’re not at a point where regulation is appropriate. The whole body is just ridiculous and the whole brain is only slightly less ridiculous.”



The British philosopher Mary Warnock said people considering cryogenic freezing had to be better informed, although she did not support a ban or other legislation. “People are being ruthlessly exploited by these companies who are guilty of exploiting those who are vulnerable because of distress – that is the real ethical dilemma,” she said.



The cosmologist and astrophysicist Prof Martin Rees said the promises made by cryonics enthusiasts were “ridiculous and not to be taken seriously”. He said: “In my view it is most unlikely that this is feasible and even if it is, it should be discouraged.



“From an ethical point of view if people are going to be frozen and revived, even if they could survive they would be imposing a great obligation on future generations, and any revived person would be a nuisance or a misfit.”

But leading transhumanists – an international movement that aims to transform the human condition through technology – argue that any regulation of the fledgling industry at this stage could hamper developments. Anders Sandberg, research fellow at the Future of Humanity Institute at Oxford University, said cryonics was a controversial area better known in science fiction than in real life.

“People who want to be cryopreserved are like refugees from the present, fleeing to the future because they can’t survive here,” he said. “There is a good chance they won’t make it, their chances are slim – but it beats the alternative.”

He said cryonics companies did not promise potential users that they would be restored in full health in the future. “They say, we’ll do our best and here is our theory, but you are still confronted with mortality,” he said.

But, he argued, if people could be reanimated in the future after being frozen, medical advances were likely to mean that physical, if not emotional, complications could be fixed. “In the middle ages people thought that if you weren’t breathing, you were dead, now we know how to give CPR. In the future just because your heart is not beating may not necessarily mean that you are gone.”



Currently cryonics is unregulated and not subject to any laws in the UK. It does not fall under the remit of the Human Tissue Authority (HTA), which regulates the removal, storage and use of human tissue, because it was “not contemplated” when the Human Tissue Act was passed in 2004, the authority advised the court.

The HTA confirmed it was not seeking further regulation, but was looking at the current situation and working with others to evaluate where there may be risks to the public, or to public confidence.

Cryonics UK, the non-profit organisation that prepared the girl’s body for transport to the US cryogenic storage facility, said it would welcome regulation. “We expect that future regulation will help hospitals to know where they stand legally and procedurally. The opportunity to utilise professional medical assistance may increase as we become a recognised and better regulated field,” the organisation said in a statement.

But the legal ramifications of successful cryonics could be complex and far-reaching said Prof Nils Hoppe, an ethicist and leading academic in the field of life sciences law. “As long as it never works then we don’t have to talk about regulation, but in 10 years’ time if it has progressed to the stage where it might be possible then there are serious ethical, legal and societal questions to answer,” he said. “If death is reversible then the body is no longer an item of property to be disposed of, [the dead person] suddenly becomes an agent again.”

That possibility raised a plethora of legal and ethical complications including who would have access to expensive technology and whether people would choose to be frozen as soon as they became ill, as well as throwing inheritance laws into disarray. But he cautioned against imposing restrictive regulations or laws. “Strong laws can hinder innovation which we do need in this area,” Hoppe said.

He added: “It would be a fantastic thing if it works – but while fascinating, it could be massively problematic.”

Prisons, whether we like them or not, are an essential public service that have never been a priority when it comes to government spending. But when there is a long-term squeeze on funding from successive governments who have had no idea about the role prison officers and associated staff perform, there are seriously detrimental effects.

That is why it was absolutely essential this week that prison officers made their concerns known in the most public possible way, by taking protest action to highlight their concerns, laying bare the prison service’s darkest secrets for all to see. The court injunction to end the strike is another sad indictment of the conditions prison officers have to operate within. We have no formal way to pursue our grievances, no way of getting our concerns listened to, and a system that is designed to hide the facts and conceal the truth of the consistent failings in prisons.

It has been a failure of many governments not to invest appropriately in prisons. Attracting, recruiting and retaining the very best talent to work with prisoners in order to turn their lives around should be at the forefront of all considerations. The political merry-go-round of successive justice secretaries looking to make a name for themselves has either quickly made them, or in some instances quickly broken them.

So it is unfortunate that the most recent appointee to the role, Liz Truss, has taken over the helm at a critical stage in the ongoing failure of the prison system, with murder, violence, self-harm, suicide, riots and even escapees a regular occurrence. It is no wonder the public have demanded answers about how such failures have been allowed to happen.

Truss’s predecessors failed to bring about positive reform and predominantly preoccupied themselves with reducing the cost of a broken system, rather than taking the time to stop and listen to the core problems from experienced staff. This has left Truss the unenviable task of mending a system that’s in a state of disarray and deterioration. As she quite rightly says, there are no quick fixes.

A justice minister, however, has a sizeable number of interested parties who will seek to influence direction in the prison estate. For various reasons this can be unhelpful if the messages conflict with one another and do not create a clear picture. That is why it is essential that the running of the prison system is left to the experts in the field: the staff.

Many organisations have strong views on the number of prisoners that are locked up, the care they receive, the education and support needed to turn a prisoner’s life around. But the core role of security, discipline, control and order should never be interfered with by an outsider. Those on the outside may not always agree with how these services are delivered, but for prison officers to achieve them they must be supported in their methods and not demonised.

In recent years, savage budget cuts mean that over 30% of frontline staffing has been removed, and the net effect of this is a loss of control. The Prison Officers’ Association is a responsible trade union, and we have patiently tried to work with the government and our employers to bring about change that not only benefits our members but also improves the lives of prisoners and the general public alike, fostering safer, more viable institutions under increasingly impossible constraints.

Whatever your view of prisons and how prisoners should be treated, recent news stories have shown that none of what you expect to be happening inside is currently achievable. The system will need much more than the promised £100m a year to recruit and retain staff while bringing security, discipline, control and order back to prisons.

Health campaigners have accused the Scotch Whisky Association of arrogance after it launched a fresh legal challenge over plans for minimum alcohol pricing in Scotland.

To the dismay of medical experts and ministers in Edinburgh, the SWA said it would appeal to the UK supreme court against a Scottish court ruling last month that plans for a 50p minimum price for alcohol were compatible with EU law.

Alcohol charities said the SWA, which represents global drinks giants such as Diageo and Pernod Ricard alongside smaller family distillers, was borrowing tactics from tobacco companies, putting their commercial interests above public health.

“Twenty-two Scots are dying because of alcohol every single week,” said Alison Douglas, chief executive of Alcohol Focus Scotland. “In taking legal action, SWA members like Diageo and Pernod Ricard continue to put their shareholders’ profits above the public interest. When it comes to the nation’s health, we cannot allow the alcohol industry to call the shots.

“It is totally disingenuous of the SWA to say they are committed to tackling alcohol harm when they consistently block the single most effective measure to achieve that. They are borrowing from the tactics of the tobacco companies in delaying this live-saving measure.”

The Scottish health secretary, Shona Robison, said she was deeply saddened by the SWA’s decision to appeal again against another ruling by Scottish judges. She urged the association to drop its legal action.

“I think the SWA may want to consider that minimum unit pricing was passed with the overwhelming support of the parliament, has been tested in Europe, and has now been approved twice in the Scottish courts,” she said.

“We remain committed to ongoing dialogue with the alcohol industry. Should the SWA drop their appeal, and accept that the time has now come to implement this measure that will save lives, they could expect very strong support from across Scotland.”

A 50p minimum unit price would push the cost of a standard bottle of whisky up to £14. The data analyst Nielsen said earlier this week its research showed 69% of spirits in Scotland would be affected, and 67% of beers. Measured by brand, 76% of Scotland’s most popular spirits would have to increase prices, Nielsen said, with blended scotch prices rising by 20% overall.

The fresh appeal is likely to delay a final ruling well into 2017. The SWA’s legal battle began four years ago and its case has now twice gone through the Scottish courts, with the drinks industry losing each time.

Backed by European drinks associations and nine EU member states including France, it insists that imposing a fixed starting price for all drinks is a breach of EU competition and free trade rules. The SWA argues a blanket approach penalises responsible drinkers unjustifiably, when ordinary taxation could be used to target cheaper types of drink.

The European court of justice (ECJ) ruled last December that this was a clear issue but it referred the case back to the Scottish courts to assess whether that breach of EU competition rules was justified on health grounds. The ECJ added it had to be shown to be more proportionate and effective than using general taxation.

The Treasury already taxes certain alcohol drinks more heavily than others, targeting some on health grounds. However Scottish ministers have no control over drinks taxation but are responsible for health policy, limiting their options.

Last month, Lord Carloway, Scotland’s most senior judge, said minimum pricing was justified as there was a link between alcohol-related deaths and cheap alcohol. “The fact that the legislation would affect moderate drinkers in some way does not detract from the legitimacy of the aim as a measure designed for the general protection of public health and life,” he said.

Julie Hesketh-Laird, the SWA’s acting chief executive, would not explain in detail the legal basis for the further appeal, but said: “This is not a decision we have taken lightly. [But] given our strong view that minimum pricing is incompatible with EU law and likely to be ineffective, we now hope that our appeal can be heard quickly in the UK supreme court.

“Having studied the ruling, we believe the Scottish court has not properly reviewed the legislation’s compatibility with EU law as required by the European court’s judgment.”

The Sheffield Alcohol Research Group at the University of Sheffield argues that minimum unit pricing has been consistently effective and well-targeted when used abroad. It believes a 50p minimum unit price would result in 60 fewer deaths in Scotland, 1,300 fewer hospital admissions and 3,500 fewer crimes due to alcohol within the first year.

The right to make decisions about our bodies, provided we don’t harm others, is sacred. That right was today upheld by a High Court judge in approving a 14-year-old London girl’s dying wish to have her body frozen. She did so in the hope one day of coming back to life. This hope clearly gave comfort to a dying person.

Cryonics is, to many of us, absurd. But the right to employ it is not. Wanting to be buried in a fridge rather than in a grave is hardly a big deal. Rising from the dead is one of the oldest human cravings. It is central tenet of Christian faith, whether resurrection is to take place in heaven, hell, a churchyard or the second coming.. Science fiction writers imagine bodies being suspended in time to enable space travel.

The science of low-temperature physics is in its infancy. Cryonicists believe blood can be drained, stored and replaced with antifreeze-like chemicals to prevent crystallisation and the rest of the body preserved intact. Stem cells can be isolated and stabilised. Body parts can be replicated. As a field of research, some of this may yield advances in the understanding of cells and body chemistry. Some may indeed help in preserving simple body parts. But the idea that the infinity of brain cells could be locked down and then resuscitated as a human being remains fanciful. If we wish to live for ever, we must have children.

The world is full of wacky science. In America, the home of hope, over 100 bodies are believed to lie in iced storage, in what their former owners believe is suspended animation. Good luck to them, and to the scientists who charged them £65,000 each.

None of this matters at law. Today’s case is about something different, the rights of individuals and families. The girl, a minor, and her mother wanted cryonics. Her father, who is separated from her mother, did not. He changed his mind on condition he could see his daughter on her death. Her mother and her refused. What right does a teenage girl’s father have?

The answer, in this case, was none. The decision was about the rights of all of us, including in this case a mother and her child, to “own” our bodies. The wider implications extend to the right to die and be helped to die, as to abortion, drug use, cancer cures, alternative medicine and, more controversially, our custodianship of our children. A young girl’s wish to pay for the freezing and storage of her body may be eccentric. That is no reason for refusing it.

The recently announced withdrawal from the international criminal court (ICC) by Burundi, Gambia and South Africa, following earlier threats from some other African countries, has created the impression that Africa is hostile to the court. Let me emphasise, however, that the people of Africa, and particularly the victims of war crimes and crimes against humanity, and members of those communities affected by genocide, stand by the ICC. Most of the continent’s democratic governments stand by the ICC. I stand by the ICC, because the most heinous crimes must not go unpunished.

As the African who opened the conference in Rome in 1998 that led to the creation of the court, I was proud that my continent was its most enthusiastic supporter. Memories of the horrors of the Rwandan genocide were still fresh in our minds. In fact, the first signatory of the treaty was an African country: Senegal. Africa remains the single largest regional bloc, with 34 states party to the Rome statute out of 124.

We also made the most use of the institution from the outset: of the nine investigations on the African continent, eight were requested by African states, six African states referred their own situation to the ICC, and African states voted in support of the UN security council referrals on Darfur and Libya. Kenya was the only case in Africa opened independently by the court, but it enjoyed the enthusiastic support of a majority of Kenyans. They wanted justice for the 1,300 people killed and hundreds of thousands displaced in election-related violence.

The ICC got involved in these African cases because national authorities did not conduct investigations into the massive crimes that had occurred. The ICC does not supplant national jurisdictions, it only intervenes in cases where the country concerned is either unable or unwilling to try its own citizens. Africans deserve justice as much as anyone else, even if their governments cannot always provide it.

Some retort that the African court on justice and human rights should play that role on the continent. Its protocol was adopted two years ago, but it remains largely unratified. For the time being, the ICC remains the continent’s most credible court of last resort for the most serious crimes.

To those who think that Africa is the sole subject of international justice, we should remind them that international criminal tribunals were first set up after the second world war, at Nuremberg and Tokyo. After the cold war, more international or mixed tribunals were set up for crimes in Lebanon, Cambodia and Yugoslavia.

Nor will international justice stop in Africa. The ICC’s chief prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, an accomplished African lawyer, has opened investigations in Georgia and is conducting preliminary examinations in Afghanistan, Colombia, Ukraine, Iraq and Palestine.

Finally, we need to recognise that the mere existence of the ICC can serve as a deterrent for leaders tempted by violence to shore up their regimes. Be that as it may, we should never forget that justice is its own virtue.

All this is not to say that the ICC is beyond reproach. Most egregiously, the fact that only two of the five permanent members of the United Nations security council – the UK and France – are signatories to the Rome statute (and therefore members of the court), opens the court up to accusations of double standards. It is clearly unacceptable that states with special and historical responsibility for world peace and security should undermine the court’s legitimacy in this way. Those who claim the mantle of global leadership should lead by example. Moreover, the quality of the court’s investigations, its lengthy judicial process and its ability to protect witnesses have been called into question.

These shortcomings must be addressed, but they are reasons to support the ICC’s efforts to rectify them, not to quit the court, one of the most significant achievements of international society since the end of the cold war.

As I have said before, Africa wants this court. Africa needs this court. Africa should continue to support this court. This is why I call on Africa’s democratic governments to take a principled stand this week at the Assembly of States Parties meeting in The Hague to shore up the ICC, a historic milestone on humanity’s journey towards international justice.

The apparent African exodus from the international criminal court must be stopped or the most heinous crimes will be allowed to go unpunished, Kofi Annan, the former UN secretary general and one of the ICC’s chief architects, has warned.

Burundi, Gambia and South Africa said this year they would no longer recognise the court’s jurisdiction and announced their intention to quit. They claim the ICC disproportionately targets African leaders. Nine of the 10 cases taken by the court have involved former African rulers.

Annan’s intervention is designed to influence the annual meeting of the Assembly of States Parties, whose members are signatories to the ICC. He warned the actions of the three African countries risked giving the false impression the entire continent was hostile to the court.

Annan was pivotal to the court’s creation when he was UN secretary general, hosting the inaugural conference in Rome in 1998.

Writing in the Guardian, he says: “Most of the continent’s democratic governments stand by the ICC. I stand by the ICC, because the most heinous crimes must not go unpunished.” 



He says Africa “was [the court’s] most enthusiastic supporter” at the ICC’s inception. “Memories of the horrors of the Rwandan genocide were still fresh in our minds. In fact, the first signatory of the treaty was an African country, Senegal. Africa remains the single largest regional bloc, with 34 states party to the Rome statute out of 124,” he writes.

Annan said the focus of the ICC’s work in Africa did not indicate any bias but rather Africa’s willingness to refer cases to it. “Of the nine investigations on the African continent, eight were requested by African states. Six African states referred their own situation to the ICC, and African states voted in support of the UN security council referrals on Darfur and Libya,” he writes.

“Kenya was the only case in Africa opened independently by the court, but it enjoyed the enthusiastic support of a majority of Kenyans. They wanted justice for the 1,300 people killed and hundreds of thousands displaced in election-related violence.”

Annan said Africa was not the sole subject of international justice, pointing out that criminal tribunals were first set up after the second world war, at Nuremberg and Tokyo. After the cold war, more international or mixed tribunals were launched for crimes in Lebanon, Cambodia and Yugoslavia. The ICC has opened investigations in Georgia and is conducting preliminary examinations in Afghanistan, Columbia, Ukraine, Iraq and Palestine.



He said the “ICC remains the continent’s most credible court of last resort for the most serious crimes … [It] does not supplant national jurisdictions; it only intervenes in cases where the country concerned is either unable or unwilling to try its own citizens.”

A 14-year-old girl who said before dying of cancer that she wanted a chance to live longer has been allowed by the high court to have her body cryogenically frozen in the hope that she can be brought back to life at a later time.

The court ruled that the teenager’s mother, who supported the girl’s wish to be cryogenically preserved, should be the only person allowed to make decisions about the disposal of her body. Her estranged father had initially opposed her wishes.

During the last months of her life, the teenager, who had a rare form of cancer, used the internet to investigate cryonics. Known only as JS, she sent a letter to the court: “I have been asked to explain why I want this unusual thing done. I’m only 14 years old and I don’t want to die, but I know I am going to. I think being cryo‐preserved gives me a chance to be cured and woken up, even in hundreds of years’ time. 



“I don’t want to be buried underground. I want to live and live longer and I think that in the future they might find a cure for my cancer and wake me up. I want to have this chance. This is my wish.”

Following the ruling, in a case described by the judge as exceptional, the body of JS has now been preserved and transported from where she lived in London to the US, where it has been frozen “in perpetuity” by a commercial company at a cost of £37,000.

The girl’s parents are divorced. She had lived with her mother for most of her life and had had no face-to-face contact with her father since 2008. She resisted his attempts to get back in touch when he learnt of her illness in 2015.

The judge, Mr Justice Peter Jackson, ruled that nothing about the case should be reported while she was alive because media coverage would distress her. She was too ill to attend the court hearing but the judge visited her in hospital.

Jackson wrote: “I was moved by the valiant way in which she was facing her predicament. It is no surprise that this application is the only one of its kind to have come before the courts in this country, and probably anywhere else. It is an example of the new questions that science poses to the law, perhaps most of all to family law … No other parent has ever been put in [the] position [of JS’s father].”

He added: “A dispute about a parent being able to see his child after death would be momentous enough on its own if the case did not also raise the issue of cryonic preservation.”

Since the first preservation by freezing in the 1960s the process has been performed only a few hundred times. The body has to be prepared shortly after death, ideally within minutes. Arrangements then have to be made for the body to be transported by a registered funeral director.

“The scientific theory underlying cryonics is speculative and controversial, and there is considerable debate about its ethical implications,” Jackson said. “On the other hand, cryopreservation, the preservation of cells and tissues by freezing, is now a well-known process in certain branches of medicine, for example the preservation of sperm and embryos as part of fertility treatment. Cryonics is cryopreservation taken to its extreme.” 



The judge said the girl’s family was not well off but that her mother’s parents had raised the money. A voluntary UK group of cryonics enthusiasts, who were not medically trained, had offered to help make arrangements. 



Co-operation of a hospital was required. “This situation gives rise to serious legal and ethical issues for the hospital trust,” the judge observed, “which has to act within the law and has duties to its other patients and to its staff.” 



The hospital trust in the case was willing to help although it stressed it was not endorsing cryonics. “On the contrary, all the professionals feel deep unease about it,” the judge said.



The Human Tissue Authority (HTA), which regulates organisations which remove, store and use human tissue, had been consulted but said it had no remit to intervene in such a case.

“The HTA would be likely to make representations that activities of the present kind should be brought within the regulatory framework if they showed signs of increasing,” Jackson said. 



The HTA said: “We are gathering information about cryopreservation to determine how widespread it is currently, or could become in the future, and any risks it may pose to the individual, or public confidence more broadly. We are in discussion with key stakeholders … and the possible need for regulatory oversight.”

The government may need to intervene in future, Jackson said: “It may be … events in this case suggest the need for proper regulation of cryonic preservation in this country if it is to happen in future.”

Inquiries made of American authorities revealed that there was no prohibition on human remains being shipped to the US for cryonic preservation, providing certain provisions were made.

During the course of the 14-year-old’s case, the father changed his mind and told the court: “I respect the decisions [my daughter] is making. This is the last and only thing she has asked from me.”

A child cannot make a will and the court had to decide where the girl’s best interests lay. The judge concluded that allowing the mother to make a decision about her daughter would be in her best interests. The girl died peacefully knowing that her body would be frozen, the judge recorded.

The Department of Health said: “Cases such as this are rare. Although there are no current plans for legislative change in this area, this is an area we will continue to keep under review with the Human Tissue Authority.

The decision of a teenage girl to have her body cryogenically frozen in the hope of being reanimated by medical advances in the future is one with which many could sympathise. But does current evidence suggest the gamble will pay off, or does cryonics simply give desperate people false hope dressed up in the language of science?



There are two advances that make cryonics a little less far-fetched that it once was. The first is vitrification. As Arctic explorers and mountaineers have learned, humans are not designed to be frozen and defrosted. When our cells freeze, they fill with ice crystals, which break down cell walls as they expand, reducing our body to mush once it is warmed up again.

Vitrification prevents this by replacing the blood with a mixture of antifreeze-like chemicals and an organ preservation solution. When cooled to below -90C, the fluid becomes a glass-like solid.

The technique has substantially improved the reliability of freezing and thawing embryos, and particularly eggs, in fertility treatment and it works for small pieces of tissue and blood vessels. Earlier this year, scientists managed to cryogenically freeze the brain of a rabbit and recover it in an “excellent” state – although it is not clear if the brain’s functions would have been preserved as well as its superficial appearance. However, even vitrifying larger structures, such as human kidneys for transplantation, has never been done clinically and remains some way off.

Barry Fuller, a professor in surgical science and low temperature medicine, at University College London, said: “There is ongoing research into these scientific challenges, and a potential future demonstration of the ability to cryopreserve human organs for transplantation would be a major first step into proving the concept, but at the moment we cannot achieve that.”

This is the growing appreciation that our personality, skills and memories are to some extent defined by the connections between neurons. This has led some to speculate that rather than bringing the actual body back to life, the brain’s contents could be “downloaded” on to a computer, allowing the person to live as a robot in the future.

This might have the whiff of nonsense, but Nick Bostrom, a professor of philosophy at the University of Oxford’s Future of Humanity Institute, and his colleague, Anders Sandberg, are both banking on this possibility. “As a head, my life would be limited, but by then we will be able to make real connections to computers,” Anders said in a 2013 interview. “So my hope is that, once revived, my memories and personality could be downloaded into a computer.”

However, many neuroscientists have pointed out that even if you could code the astronomical number of connections between the brain’s 100bn neurons, even this would not capture the full complexity of the human mind.

From a purely scientific perspective, your money is probably better spent while you are still alive.

James Ward was convicted of arson in 2006. He was given an indeterminate sentence for public protection (IPP) for the protection of the public with a tariff – the minimum sentence he had to serve before he could be considered for parole – of 10 months. Back then, Charles Clarke was home secretary in a Labour government with a mission to be tough on crime. That was a decade ago. Soon afterwards sentencing became a matter for the new justice department. Liz Truss is currently its sixth secretary of state. James Ward is still in prison. David Blunkett, the Labour home secretary who introduced the IPP policy in 2005, long ago recognised that it was a mistake.

Within months of the power coming into force it was clear that nervous courts were using it too often for fear of public shaming at the hands of the media. In 2008, another justice secretary, Jack Straw, introduced a “threshold of seriousness”, restricting IPPs to serious offences that carried a tariff of more than two years. But it was not retrospective: those already in prison stayed there. In 2012, Mr Straw’s successor, Kenneth Clarke – who had inherited 6,000 prisoners on IPPs, of whom nearly a third had already served more than their tariff – finally changed the law, but only after he had been widely vilified for calling them “absurd”. Once again, the change did not apply retrospectively.

And that is why James Ward, a man with a low IQ and mental health problems, who has told the BBC that he feels trapped in a box, is still locked up. So are another 3,859 prisoners sentenced to an IPP, 3,200 of whom are beyond their tariff expiry date. Many have served more than five years above their original tariff. Undoubtedly, some remain a risk. But it is hard to say how many because, as Peter Clarke, the chief inspector of prisons says in his latest annual report, many are still denied access to the behaviour amendment courses they need to complete in order even to apply for parole. This, as a court has said, is “deplorable”. It’s a system that wrongs individuals while wasting scarce resources in a prison service so short of cash that many prisoners are locked up for 23 hours a day.

On Thursday Michael Gove became the latest former justice secretary to recant. Delivering the Longford Trust lecture in memory of the great 20th-century prison reformer, he listed the things he might have done had he not embarked on a course of auto-defenestration after the referendum. Among them, he included releasing those 500 or so prisoners serving indeterminate sentences who have served more than the maximum sentence for the offence. Of course, it is a shame he did not consider executive clemency while he was in charge. But crime and punishment have been politically neuralgic ever since Michael Howard first claimed that prison works. That is why IPPs were first introduced, and that is why it is now so hard to get rid of them. It will need a consensus; Mr Gove’s defenders will argue that is what he was trying to build.

Meanwhile this government, so determined to take back control, is visibly not in control of prisons like Guys Marsh in Dorset, where pictures of inmates apparently enjoying a party escaped from social media to the front of the Daily Mail. The government is at a fork in the road on prisons policy. It could take the expensive course of building more prisons and recruiting more officers. Or it could take up the Gove challenge of sending fewer to prison and giving them a more constructive prison experience. Releasing those who have already served far too long is one of those rare policy objectives: it is the right thing to do to save money. And it is the right thing to do for the sake of justice.

Mauritius is threatening to take the UK to the international court of justice in a dispute over sovereignty of the Chagos Islands.



In the wake of the Foreign Office’s announcement this week that none of the Chagossians expelled in the 1960s to make way for military bases would be allowed to return to live on the Indian Ocean archipelago, Mauritius, which claims the territory, has accused Britain of “outrageously” undermining human rights.

The prime minister, Sir Anerood Jugnauth, criticised the UK government’s refusal to let the Chagossian community return to the island, which he said “always formed and continues to form an integral part of the territory of Mauritius”.

He added: “In view of the purported unilateral actions of the UK, Mauritius would be fully justified in taking forward the completion of the process of decolonisation, which is now on the agenda of the current session of the UN general assembly, with a view to putting the matter before the international court of justice.”

A United Nations vote in favour of referring the case to the court in The Hague would have to be obtained. The Mauritian government said the UK’s “unilateral” decision to ban the right of return and to renew the lease for the US base on Diego Garcia, one of the Chagos Islands, for another 20 years breached international law.

Mauritius said the UK had “acted in blatant breach of the letter and spirit” of a judgment under the UN convention on the law of the sea last year.



“The denial of the right of Mauritians in general, and those of Chagossian origin in particular, to settle in the Chagos archipelago is a manifest breach of international law and outrageously flouts their human rights,” the statement said.

Mauritius argues that the Chagos Islands were illegally stolen from it before they were established as the British Indian Ocean Territory.

The Foreign Office in London said: “We disagree with Mauritius’ claim that the Chagos archipelago, which the UK administers as the British Indian Ocean Territory, is part of Mauritius.

“Whilst we do not recognise the Republic of Mauritius’ claim to sovereignty of the archipelago, the UK has repeatedly undertaken to cede it to Mauritius when no longer required for defence purposes, and we maintain that commitment. These defence purposes contribute significantly towards global security. Diego Garcia is a joint UK-US facility that is used by many international partners in countering terrorism and countering piracy.

“The UK is disappointed that Mauritius is seeking a request by the UN general assembly to the international court of justice for an advisory opinion on sovereignty of the British Indian Ocean Territory. The UK believes this is an inappropriate use of the ICJ mechanism and sets an unwelcome precedent for other bilateral disputes.”

A British woman who reported being raped by two men is “petrified” after being told she faces jail in Dubai for extramarital sex.

The 25-year-old tourist claimed she was attacked by two men while on holiday in the United Arab Emirates and reported the incident to police.

But officers then charged the professional from Cheshire with extramarital sex and, despite being bailed, she is not allowed to leave the country. Her passport has been confiscated and UK-based UAE legal experts Detained in Dubai said she could face a prison sentence if found guilty.

The family of the woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, have set up fundraising pages online to raise money to cover her legal costs. She is currently residing in a safe house.

The woman’s father wrote online that his daughter had met the two men in her hotel who raped her. He claims the alleged attack was filmed. He added: “She is stranded, is not allowed to leave the country, and is alone scared, and in a dreadful situation, as you can imagine.”

Shortly afterwards, two men were arrested at Dubai airport. They have been named as thai boxer David Butlin, 22, and footballer Louis Harris, 24. They have both been bailed and also remain in the country.

Butlin and Harris, who are cousins and both live in the West Midlands, have appeared on the Instagram page of Towie’s James Argent. They were pictured at a Dubai beach club with the reality TV star. The men are understood to firmly deny the claims.

A relative of Harris, who lives in Lichfield, Staffordshire, said it was a “difficult” time. She said: “All I’ll say is that he’s a really lovely boy. We can’t comment further but it’s a difficult time.”

One neighbour – who wished to remain anonymous – said Butlin was often flying back and forth from Dubai, where the alleged rape took place. They said: “It’s always on Facebook when he goes there. It must cost a lot of money.”

It is understood that the UK Foreign Office is providing assistance, including the alleged victim and two UK nationals, and working with the local authorities.

In a post on a fundraising page, the woman’s father wrote: “She was befriended by two guys from Birmingham ... and went with them for a drink, in a hotel where they were staying, the guys concerned were travelling home in around 4/5 hours.”

He added: “(NAME) was taken to the police station where the incident was reported, and the prosecutor is setting a date for her trial, which is a complicated scenario because of the laws of the country.”

After reporting the alleged assault, the woman ended up in a prison cell. Her passport was confiscated and her family claim she now faces trial. Her relative returned to the UK and she was joined in the UAE by her mother. It is understood her mother has also now returned to the UK .

Her father wrote: “(NAME) has been put in a safe house, but is stranded in the country for a period of between three and six months, or even longer, until a trial date is confirmed and the case is brought to court.”

It is claimed that the woman has had to find a lawyer to represent her and legal costs will amount to £24,000.

Nine days ago her father updated the fundraising page writing: “(NAME) mum is now on her way back to the UK, she has spent as much time as she possibly could helping to get things moving in the right direction.”

Radha Stirling, founder and director of Detained in Dubai, said the woman could be stuck in Dubai for as long as six months even if she was found innocent.

“There is a huge backlog in the system,” she said. “If she wins the first stage, the prosecution can appeal and they often do … So by the time she is found innocent, by the time she gets her passport returned, we can be talking at least six months.”

Stirling said the UAE was not a safe place for women to report allegations of rape. “Sex outside marriage is a crime there and, therefore, if a rape allegation is made and can’t be proved to be rape then it’s almost automatic that the person is charged with voluntary sex outside marriage,” she said.

Stirling said it was hard to predict what the woman’s sentence would be if she were found guilty of having extramarital sex. “They have no precedent system there so while one person can be given one year for the same allegations, another person might be given one month or six months or just a deportation or a fine.”

She said similar cases in the past had resulted in seven-month prison sentences and that the best chance the family had to speed up the process would be to work to put diplomatic and media pressure on the UAE government.

A Foreign Office spokeswoman said: “We are supporting a British woman in relation to this case and will remain in contact with her family.”

In 2008 an Australian woman, Alicia Gali, was jailed for eight months in Fujairah for having an illicit sexual relationship after she reported being drugged and raped by three co-workers. In 2009, the South African national Roxanne Hillier was jailed for three months after it was alleged she spent time alone with her male employer, despite medical reports suggesting she had not had sex.

The fundraising page has now raised more than £11,000.

The government has announced a review of the use of rape complainants’ sexual history during court cases in the wake of concerns that the acquittal of footballer Ched Evans could deter women from reporting attacks.

The retrial in which Evans was cleared last month of raping a 19-year-old woman prompted outrage from campaigners after a key part of the defence argument involved describing the complainant’s previous sexual history.

This is permitted, under strict conditions, by section 41 of the Youth and Criminal Evidence Act 1999. Women’s support groups said its use in such a high-profile case could set a precedent and put off others from pursuing a complaint.

News of the review came in a debate on crime and policing in the House of Lords on Wednesday, when the Liberal Democrat peer Jonathan Marks raised the Evans case. He argued that the case “raised fears that complainants will be deterred from reporting rape because they might be cross-examined about their sexual history”.

In response, Susan Williams, a junior Home Office minister who also works with the Ministry of Justice, argued that the legislative bar put in place by section 41 was “high and decided by judges on a case-by-case basis”, meaning there should be no risk of it happening more often.

But she added: “We are aware of the recent concern about the admissibility of a complainant’s previous sexual history, and wider perceptions about the law. We accept that the concern should be looked at and we intend to deal with it. We have committed to looking at how the law is working in practice and will do so as expeditiously as possible, to understand whether any further action needs to be taken.”

Asked whether this meant the government was undertaking a review of the law, Lady Williams replied: “Yes.”

The announcement was hailed as “exceptionally good news” by Jess Phillips, who was among more than 40 female Labour MPs who wrote to the attorney general in the wake of the Evans case warning about the possible consequences.

In the letter to Jeremy Wright, the MPs said a move towards revisiting the sexual history of complainants in court would “act to make the prosecution of rape cases in the future harder and reporting of these crimes less likely”.



“The verdict and events in this case set a dangerous precedent that how a victim of rape, usually a woman, has behaved in the past can be taken as evidence of the way she behaved at the time of the alleged rape,” they wrote.

Phillips said that although Wright had indicated willingness to look into the matter, she and her fellow MPs had not been told before now that anything was happening.

She said that although the Evans case did not create a strict precedent under law, she remained worried about the impression it left. “Because of the high-profile nature of the case and the way it happened, it sends a terrible, terrible message,” she said. “If we can even just amend the law slightly to toughen up the protections against this sort of case then that’s what we need to do.”

The MP, who formerly worked with a charity helping victims of domestic sexual abuse, said: “A review of the law and how the law needs to work is very much needed. Lawyers might say no change is needed, but as someone who has spent a lot of time in courtrooms, my faith in the ability of this system to work for sexual violence victims is at a low ebb already. Any protection is a good thing.”

Lord Marks, the Lib Dems’ legal spokesman, said the Evans case had “led to the perception that a victim’s sexual history can be combed through and used against them in court”, which could lead to fewer people coming forward to report rape.

“We all have a responsibility to ensure that victims of rape are encouraged to come forward to enable justice to be done,” he said. “That is why we sought a review of how section 41 is working, to ensure that the section is as restrictive as we have long thought it is.”

The law professor and barrister Norman Palmer, who has died of motor neurone disease aged 68, used his expertise in common law and what he called “legal ingenuity” to help foreign clients as diverse as the Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre and the government of Iran claim back important cultural objects and remains that had ended up on British soil.

In 2007 the Islamic Republic of Iran was attempting to appeal aginst an unfavourable high court decision over the recovery of 18 bronze age bowls, jars and cups found in the possession of the Barakat Gallery in Mayfair, London. The exquisitely carved objects offered a window on to a hitherto little-known period in human history about 4,500 years ago, but had been illegally excavated in Iran after flooding in the Jiroft area a few years before and spirited out of the country without an export licence. Iran wanted them back, and its solicitors recruited Palmer to help with the case.

The issue was not whether the Barakat Gallery was innocent in all of this: the gallery had bought the objects in Europe on the open market and claimed good title to them; the question was instead whether Iran had an enforceable legal claim to recover its artefacts once they had left its territory. Employing a series of creative property and tort-based arguments, and working alongside Sir Sydney Kentridge and others, Palmer was able to advance the claim that Iran maintained ownership of the artefacts through a 1979 cultural heritage law, despite never having come into possession of them. On this crucial point, the court of appeal decided in Iran’s favour. Following negotiations with the gallery, the objects were returned to their homeland.

Palmer was more recently asked to provide a legal opinion for the Greek government with Geoffrey Robertson QC and Amal Clooney on the position of the Parthenon marbles in international and British law, a document that was delivered in the summer of 2015. “I didn’t quite see why it was worthy of all that press coverage,” he said wryly at the time.

Like all good barristers, he would argue his client’s case in the most convincing of ways. However, he remained motivated by the search for an amicable resolution – not one fought out in court, but one resulting from the parties sitting round the table and seeing eye to eye. In his lectures, he often quoted a line associated with a 17th-century peace treaty: “One peace is worth countless victories.” The titles of some of his recent law journal publications – Waging and Engaging: Reflections on the Mediation of Art and Antiquity Claims; The Best We Can Do? Exploring a Collegiate Approach to Holocaust-related Claims – indicate that he took this saying to heart. He believed that a resolution was always possible, and one in which both sides could be satisfied.

Nowhere was this more clear than when he worked for the Indigenous Australians of the Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre, who were looking to claim back the bones of their ancestors that had been taken by explorers and settlers and later donated to the Natural History Museum in London. Palmer advised the group to obtain court permission to bury the remains in Tasmania, then bring the court order to Britain, thus putting pressure on the museum to negotiate. The legal ingenuity worked. The parties entered a mediation that led to a successful settlement, whereby the remains were returned to Tasmania and met with a traditional ceremony of welcome by the group.

Born in Grays, Essex, the son of Muriel (nee Walker) and Norman Palmer, he went to Palmer’s Endowed school, then won a scholarship to read law at Magdalen College, Oxford, eventually becoming professor of law at Reading, then Essex and Southampton universities, and from 1991 at University College London. In 1979 he wrote his landmark legal tome, Palmer on Bailment, seen by many in the legal profession as a work of peerless scholarship. Following his retirement from institutional academia in 2002, as professor of commercial law at UCL (he became emeritus professor after retirement), he decided to focus on his practice as a barrister, and the cultural heritage briefs started to flow in.

Palmer chaired a number of government-appointed cultural heritage bodies, such as the advisory panel on illicit trade (2000-05), on which he succeeded in obtaining unanimity for the recommendation that the UK join the 1970 Unesco convention, which aims to curb the illicit trade in looted antiquities (the UK acceded to the convention in 2002). He sat on the UK’s spoliation advisory panel, which hears claims involving Holocaust-era art kept at British institutions, from its inception in 2000 until last year.

He married Ruth Redmond-Cooper, his second wife, in 1994 and a year later they set up the Institute of Art and Law, an independent educational organisation.

He is survived by Ruth and their daughter Lilian, his daughter, Victoria, from his first marriage to Judith Weeks, which ended in divorce, and three grandchildren.

Environmental legal challenges face being hit by the “chilling effect” of new government rules that remove a cap on claimants’ costs, according to campaigners, lawyers and politicians.

They warn that the changes could deter organisations and individuals challenging projects such as fracking wells, HS2 and the Heathrow third runway for fear of racking up huge court costs.

The costs to complainants bringing environmental judicial reviews, which account for less than 1% of all judicial reviews, have been capped since 2013.

Individuals and organisations who bring such cases currently pay no more than £5,000 and £10,000 respectively of defendants’ costs, in addition to their own costs. Under the Ministry of Justice’s plans published on Thursday, there will be no fixed cost, and the costs could go up or down, depending on the claimant’s finances.

The government argues that the changes would still allow valid challenges and checks on public authorities, but deter ones without merit.

But groups involved in supporting and bringing such judicial reviews warned the move would put off valid future cases.

Jamie Beagent, a partner at law firm Leigh Day, said: “These proposals will create a climate of fear and uncertainty amongst those wishing to challenge projects imposed upon them and their environment.”

Caroline Lucas, Green party MP, said: “We know that high and uncertain costs have a chilling effect on the ability of ordinary citizens and civil society to hold the government to account on these issues. In this context, these proposals represent a huge threat to environmental justice and we will fight them every step of the way.”

One such environmental judicial review will be heard next week in the Royal Courts. Friends of the Earth and an anti-fracking group argue that North Yorkshire county council’s decision earlier this year to approve planning permission for a fracking site at Kirby Misperton is unlawful.

The government’s defeat in the high court earlier this month over air quality, which could now see dirty diesel cars charged to enter cities across the country, began with an environmental judicial review. The MoJ said that there were 293 such cases between April 2013 and May 2015.

The changes come at the same time as the green light has been given to a slew of big and environmentally controversial infrastructure projects, from an expanded Heathrow and HS2 to a trio of shale gas sites which are likely to be drilled next year.

Campaigners fear the proposals could have a significant impact on everyone from individuals to residents groups and large environmental NGOs.

Naima Siddiqi, director of regulatory affairs at Friends of the Earth, said: “This change in law would make it harder for anybody who wants to challenge controversial development like fracking or incinerators near their home. The government can fix all this by reversing their plans.”

Gillian Lobo, a lawyer for ClientEarth which brought the air pollution case, called the changes regressive. “These new plans make it even harder for people to bring environmental cases, by increasing uncertainty around costs and making the procedure ever more complex,” she said.



An MoJ spokesperson said: “We want a justice system that works for everyone. The cost of bringing environmental challenges must not be prohibitively expensive, especially to those with limited means.

“Our proposals will also deter unmeritorious claims, which are expensive and delay vital infrastructure projects.”

It’s 6.30am and still dark, and Jean is setting out for her job as a home care worker. When she returns in 12 hours’ time she will have made 23 house calls to sick and elderly people, driven 20 miles between appointments and earned £64.80 before tax.

Jean isn’t her real name. Along with fellow care workers in this northern town she is on a zero-hours contract and fears losing work if her employer is unhappy with her. She fears that speaking out about how she has to race between visits, cutting short her appointments in order to earn the “national living wage”, might result in an immediate loss of earnings.

Jean is one of an army of care workers who go into people’s homes every day to help with tasks that enable them to keep living independently. As the population ages it is a growing industry, and more than 600,000 people are now employed in the care sector. Those working on the frontline – often for agencies working on council contracts – do jobs such as preparing food, making beds, prompting people to take their medication and tidying up. These jobs are often advertised on minimal rates of pay, and typically they involve no guaranteed working hours.



The agency, as she describes it, is a hard taskmaster. “I leave home at half six and I’ll probably get home at about seven and I’ll get about £270 a week,” she says. “The clients are all lovely and sometimes you go out of your way to do more for them, but it’s hard because there’s no time to get from one place to the next.”

Jean works 12 days on and two days off. Her list of appointments comes through on a Friday but can change during the week as people are discharged from hospital and added to her client list, or admitted to hospital and removed. She may also be asked to cover a colleague’s visits if they are off.



With a zero-hours contract, there is no minimum guarantee of work, and Jean’s days can shrink or grow. She cannot be sure from one day to the next how long she will work or how much she will earn. It can even change while she is on a shift: on the day that I trailed her she was expecting a six-hour shift in the morning but saw an appointment disappear from the roster on her phone while she was at another house. That meant she was instantly down £1.80 on the amount she expected to earn for the day. “Probably once a week you get a cancellation or they will ring you up and ask, ‘Can you do extra?,’” she says.

Some agencies offer higher rates of pay than Jean is on, but the tendency to offer zero-hours contracts still causes problems for workers. One care worker on the London living wage of £9.40 an hour told the Guardian that her weekly pay fell by almost £70 after she lost seven hours’ work. The cuts to shifts come as patients die or are taken into hospital, and workers can wait weeks to be allocated new visits.

In her role as a care worker Jean visits some homes three times a day, making breakfast, lunch and tea, and providing some of her clients with their only human contact all day. Her phone roster lists the jobs scheduled for the day and the length of each appointment. Typically there is a mix of 15-minute and 30-minute visits, although sometimes she is booked at a house for longer.

Councils typically pay agencies for visiting time. When Jean arrives at a house she swipes her phone to say she has arrived, and she swipes again when she leaves. She is paid for the time that is shown on the roster, rather than how long she is actually providing care. The phone tracks her movements throughout the day.

The roster allows no time for travel between appointments – and she is not paid for it. To stay with each client for the full appointment time and make it to the next one on time would require some kind of teleporter – in reality she has to cut every one of them short so that she can leave the house, sometimes put a key back into a safe, get back in her car and travel to the next address. As a result, sometimes appointments scheduled for 30 minutes actually last only 20 so she can stay on schedule. “I’m going to be running around like a headless chicken later,” she says, looking at the afternoon’s roster of short appointments.



On the day I shadow Jean, she works nine hours over two shifts and takes home £7.20 an hour for that time – exactly the national living wage, but only because she cuts appointments short to travel between clients.

She says it is a good day. The morning appointments are straightforward and with people she has visited before, so she knows where they live and how to find things in their homes.

But it is not always like that. “If I have a new patient I have to read the care plan, so that takes longer,” she says. “And I’m often in a home for longer than is scheduled. If I have to call an ambulance for someone I have to wait for it to arrive and I don’t get paid for that time. If I go over by five, 10, 15 minutes on a call then I don’t get paid for that.”



For Jean and other care workers, payment for transport expenses is erratic. She gets some money for petrol, she explains, but the amount varies and is never more than £10 a week. Business insurance cover for her car, along with wear and tear, all add to her costs. In London, one worker told the Guardian she received 56p to cover a week’s visits to a patient done by bus and on foot. A single fare costs £1.50.



For Jean, there are larger concerns than transport costs. It is stressful work, she says, and she feels she has little support. One of the worst things, she says, is the isolation. “It’s a lonely job,” she says – while she may see her colleagues driving past to their calls, she rarely has a chance to speak to them. “You are in the car on your own, you get to people’s houses and often face problems on your own. They tell you all of their worries and then you take them home. Often at night I’m tossing and turning worrying about them.” But despite this she says: “I love my job – I’m completely attached to it.”

The Prison Officers Association will resume talks with the justice secretary, Liz Truss, after the high court ordered it to end a 24-hour protest about rising violence in jails.

The National Offender Management Service (Noms), part of the Ministry of Justice, contacted the POA to offer a meeting with Truss on Thursday.

The 10,000-member union held protests outside prisons in England and Wales that were due to last throughout Tuesday, but officers were ordered back to work at 5pm by the court.

Government lawyers accused the POA of trying to “impose their own limited regime” in jails across England and Wales against the wishes of the Prison Service, by taking action that amounted to a strike.

The union had insisted that the 24-hour protest, which included a provision for emergency cover, was necessary to keep staff and inmates safe amid a surge in jail violence and a prison system in “meltdown”.

It claimed victory after a “long and very difficult day” by securing the promise of a meeting with the justice secretary within 48 hours.

Truss accused the union of walking away from talks and taking action without notice. The MoJ insisted that Truss only agreed to meet the POA after it agreed to end the protest. 



“The justice secretary already met with the POA earlier this month, but would not do so again until they called off their unlawful action,” an MoJ spokesman said.

“Now that prison officers are back at work, she will meet the POA, and invites them to resume talks with her team.

“We are committed to improving safety across the prison estate and are already taking action. This includes tackling the use of drugs, mobile phones and drones, while recruiting new staff and improving protection for staff.”

Although emergency cover was provided during the protest, the POA action meant prisoners were kept in their cells, a situation described as dangerous by the chief executive of Noms, Michael Spurr. He said the protest amounted to a strike, which the POA is banned from taking by law.

The action followed a string of high-profile incidents at prisons, including an alleged murder, a riot and the escape of two inmates.

Two prisoners escaped from HMP Pentonville in north London earlier this month, but were eventually recaptured.

Weeks earlier, Jamal Mahmoud, 21, died after being stabbed at the jail on 18 October in an attack that left two others injured. On 6 November, up to 200 prisoners rioted at HMP Bedford.

Announcing the action, the union said the “continued surge in violence and unprecedented levels of suicide and acts of self-harm,” coupled with the recent alleged murder and escapes, “demonstrate that the service is in meltdown”.

Up to 10,000 staff joined the protest and courts were disrupted as a result. There have been several warnings about prison safety after statistics revealed soaring levels of violence in jails in England and Wales, with assaults on staff up by 43% in the year to June.

Earlier this month, Truss unveiled her blueprint for prison reform. Measures include recruiting 2,500 frontline officers and instituting “no-fly zones” to stop drones dropping drugs and other contraband into prisons.

US senators have called for a travel ban and asset freeze for Chinese officials who abducted five Hong Kong booksellers in 2015, amid fears that Donald Trump will turn a blind eye to Chinese human rights abuses in a bid to improve relations with Beijing.

Last year five book publishers based in Hong Kong were detained by Chinese authorities and held incommunicado for months, with two abducted from Thailand and Hong Kong.

Legislation introduced by Senators Marco Rubio and Tom Cotton would require the US president to list those responsible for “the surveillance, abduction, detention, or forced confessions” of the book publishers, freeze any US-based assets and deny them entry to the US.



“In recent years Beijing has consistently undermined the ‘one country, two systems’ principle and infringed on the democratic freedoms of the residents of Hong Kong,” Rubio said in a statement.

“It is critical in the days ahead that the democratic aspirations of the people of Hong Kong be a vital US interest and foreign policy priority.”

The bill would also require the US secretary of state to issue a yearly report on Hong Kong. However the current legislative session is almost over, making it unlikely the bill will be passed.

When the UK handed the territory to China, Hong Kong was allowed under the “one country, two systems” framework to keep freedoms not available on the mainland.

Rubio introduced the legislation after meeting with democracy activist Joshua Wong, who led 79 days of street protests against the Chinese government in 2014. The 20-year-old chairman of a Hong Kong political party spoke at an event organised by the US congressional-executive commission on China.



Wong said: “Being a businessman I hope Donald Trump could know the dynamics in Hong Kong and know that to maintain the business sector benefits in Hong Kong, it’s necessary to fully support human rights in Hong Kong to maintain the judicial independence and the rule of law.”

He added the international community had a moral responsibility to Hong Kong.

Human rights activists in China and the US fear Trump will cast aside the interests of pro-democracy activists and human rights campaigners in a bid to seal what some think could be a historic rapprochement with Beijing.



Rubio also slammed a ruling by Hong Kong’s high court to ban two elected lawmakers from taking office after they staged a protest during a swearing-in ceremony.

“China’s assault on democratic institutions and human rights is of central importance to the people of Hong Kong and to its status as a free market, economic powerhouse and hub for international trade and investment,” Rubio said.

The UK justice secretary, Liz Truss, has come under severe pressure from her predecessor, Michael Gove, and the chief inspector of prisons to take urgent action to cut the prison population.

Gove said her power of “executive clemency” should be used to release 500 prisoners serving imprisonment for public protection (IPP) sentences who have already served more than the usual maximum sentences for their offences.

Peter Clarke, the chief inspector of prisons, in a report on the 3,859 IPP prisoners currently held said Truss needed to take decisive action to reduce the numbers of those still in prison years after the end of their tariff.

Gove’s backing for action on IPP prisoners was made in the 2016 Longford lecture as part of a U-turn on his refusal in office to cut the record 86,000 prison population, which he now says should be reduced over time and pragmatically.

“It is an inconvenient truth – which I swerved to an extent while in office – that we send too many people to prison. And of those who deserve to be in custody, many, but certainly not all, are sent there for too long,” he said.

In particular, the former justice secretary said he had been wrong to fear that reducing the prison population would automatically lead – at least in the short term – to a surge in crime. He pointed to the reduction in the imprisonment of the number of young offenders as being matched by a fall in youth crime as evidence.

Gove’s lecture also contained an oblique attack on the government’s deep cuts to legal aid and a plea to rescue the criminal bar, where many judges train, from professional extinction.

The report by the chief inspector of prisons published on Thursday backed Gove’s demand for urgent action on IPP prisoners. Clarke said it was now widely accepted that implementation of the sentence was flawed and had contributed to the large numbers who remain in prison often many years after the minimum period laid by their trial judge.

“The justice secretary needs to act quickly to ensure the consequences of mistakes made in the past do not continue to resonate for many years to come,” he said. In office, Gove asked the parole board, which takes the release decision on each individual IPP case, to look again at whether they could increase their release rate. 



A Ministry of Justice spokesman said the chief inspector’s report rightly highlighted concerns around the management of IPP prisoners. “That is why we have set up a new unit within the ministry of justice to tackle the backlog and are working with the parole board to improve the efficiency of the process.”

On legal affairs, Gove said the criminal bar was being squeezed to the margins. He said work was being siphoned off to solicitor advocates and by the development of an entirely new class of “plea-only” solicitor advocates who do not profess to have all the skills and competences of a qualified barrister. They were also being squeezed by legal aid payments, which is not just being cut but structured in such a way as to facilitate solicitors’ firms keeping business in-house.

“I fear that, together, alongside some of the changes made to the operation of legal aid, these developments have not worked in the broader public interest,” he said.



“There is a case for saying that the defendant in all crown court cases and the more serious magistrates court cases should be represented by a barrister … I also think there is a case for a higher quality filter being applied before people can read for the Bar in the first place and would like to see the Inns of Court play a significant part in establishing a higher quality threshold,” he said.

Our report that a well-qualified academic once earned so little on his casual contract that he had to supplement it with a job as a refuse collector is confirmation that precarious work has metastasised from unskilled or elementary-level jobs to reach parts of the economy once considered the epitome of security. According to analysis of the official figures by the University and College Union, more than half of academics in Britain’s universities, where students are paying £9,000 a year in fees, are employed on temporary or insecure contracts. They are recruits to a burgeoning class of workers, many of them described as self-employed, that make up the “just about managing”. Ranging from agency workers in warehouses and care assistants to the top-grade professions, these are the people who Theresa May has pledged to put at the heart of her response to the Brexit revolt.

As the prime minister acknowledged again in her Guildhall speech on Monday, getting it right for people on middle to low incomes is a precondition of the defence of liberalism. The shape of Britain’s workforce has been transformed in the past decade. What was once genuinely welcomed by employers and employees as flexible employment now looks much more like exploitation, made all too easy by an under-regulated jobs market. Nearly a quarter of the 32 million people in work fit this description of precarious employment; the biggest group among them are the self-employed, a definition that once suggested the budding entrepreneur or the local builder but now might also mean the Uber driver who picks you up at 2am on a Sunday morning. This is the kind of work that is undermining 100 years of confidence that children will do better than their parents, the belief that underpins social democracy.

As today’s state of the nation report on social mobility shows, people who start out in these low-paid jobs – where young workers have experienced a 15% fall in hourly rates since 2008 – struggle to escape them. Funding is scarce for “second chance” education for older workers looking to improve skills or learn new ones; further education colleges that might provide post-16 education to students who don’t go to university are losing out to apprenticeship schemes.

The chancellor, Philip Hammond, is under pressure from No 10 to introduce measures in next week’s autumn statement to tackle this exploitation. He wants to raise income tax thresholds, a costly move that helps higher earners more than those at the bottom. Instead, he should abandon universal credit cuts and resist calls to slow the increase in the rate of the “national living wage”. He should slash fees for employment tribunals, which have led to a two-thirds reduction in the number of cases. And, after our report on employment agencies, he should make sure that HMRC really is making the people behind tax avoidance schemes feel its inspectors’ hot breath on their necks. He might start work on simplifying tax law too.

In fact, a major overhaul of employment law is overdue. It is no longer fit for purpose. Ministers must recognise the impact of the transformation in the way people work, and the laws designed for a world when most people had permanent jobs don’t work properly. Matthew Taylor, who has been asked to review workers’ rights, is likely to want to look at this area when he starts his investigative roadshow round the country. But here is a short list of small changes backed by the TUC that might start to restore workers’ protection.

At the moment, there are three categories of employment – people on permanent contracts, people on zero-hours or agency contracts, and the self-employed. Only the first category is entitled to full employment protection including redundancy payments, unfair dismissal and parental leave. If casual workers had stronger rights, then the claim that zero-hours contracts are perfect for parents with caring responsibilities could be turned from a fiction – where the choice can lie all with the employer – to fact, and pregnant women could get paid leave for antenatal appointments. If, in addition, the so-called self-employed were assumed to be employed unless the employer, rather than the employee, could prove they weren’t, then workers would be protected from the kind of forced self-employment that Uber drivers are complaining about. Mrs May is right to identify the problem. Tackling this shopping list of rights would go to the heart of the disadvantage that contributed to the millions of protest votes on 23 June.

Being a barrister has its uses, Philippe Sands tells me. It means you can rustle up a speech seconds after learning that you’ve just won the UK’s top award for non-fiction. It also means you already have enough money, so can give the £30,000 prize to refugee charities, which is what Sands announced in a speech that brought the house down at Tuesday’s award ceremony.

Sands – an affable, clever, driven 55-year-old – is in splendidly combative mood when I meet him the morning after he took the Baillie Gifford prize (as the Samuel Johnson prize is now named). In his speech, he compared Lviv, the much-contested Ukrainian city at the centre of his book East West Street, with his home city of London. In what way, I ask, can the two possibly be bracketed together?

“Lviv was once a cosmopolitan, multi-ethnic, multi-religious, multi-everything city with fabulous universities, fabulous arts, an array of newspapers,” he says. “It was a mirror a century ago for our world in London today. One of the things I took away from the whole experience [of visiting and writing about the city] is take nothing for granted. They would have gone through their lives as I go through my life, imagining there are difficulties and tensions – but not that the whole thing could be swept away.”



Sands – professor of law at University College London; a founder partner of Matrix Chambers; excoriator of Tony Blair over the deceptions in the run-up to the Iraq war; and of Donald Rumsfeld for the legitimisation of torture during the “war on terror” – worries that we are on the same nationalistic trajectory that fed Nazism, led to the second world war, and turned Lviv into a “mono-city, essentially Ukrainian”.

He believes the election of Donald Trump and the growth of the nationalist right in Europe marks a dangerous moment. “I object deeply to the characterisation by Boris Johnson of Trump as a decent, liberal guy from New York. Boris Johnson would basically welcome the election of Adolf Hitler on that standard, and you can imagine the words, ‘We can work with him’, ‘He’s going to be good for Britain’.” 



Sands says we should not “cosy up” to Trump “until we have a very clear sense that our essential values are going to be fine. We don’t yet have that clarity.” We don’t even have it, he argues, from Theresa May’s government. “The events of a week ago with that headline in the Mail, ‘Enemies of the People’, was as dark a day as I can remember in this country. And the failure of the lord chancellor and the prime minister to say that goes beyond what was acceptable. It started alarm bells ringing.” 



Sands has always combined the practice of law – international law in his case – with an engagement in public events. Their inseparability hit him early, as a student at Cambridge and Harvard. “Law is politics, politics is law,” he says. “The law is there but there’s always wiggle room, and the way you apply the law will be informed by the baggage you bring to the courtroom. It’s not a mechanical application. The wiggle room might be very limited, but there will always be some, and the individual steps into that space.”



He juggles academic work, practising at the bar, and writing – first specialist legal texts, then the more polemical Lawless World and Torture Team, about the Iraq war and its aftermath. But East West Street is a dramatic departure, weaving together his search to discover what happened to his own family during the second world war with the struggle to lay a basis for international law at the trials of prominent Nazis at Nuremberg in 1945-46. 



The canvas is large, the cast of characters wide-ranging, and Sands’s pursuit of the truth about his own family relentless. There was one secret he was desperate to unlock: why his grandfather Leon Buchholz, who was born in Lviv but lived in Vienna, fled the Nazis in 1939, leaving behind his wife and one-year-old child. That child, Ruth, who is Sands’s mother, joined her father in Paris six months later. She was carried from Vienna in the arms of a stranger whose identity Sands was determined to discover.



Sands’s search for the truth about these events forms the emotional heart of the book, but he combines this personal tale with a piece of intellectual history: the battle at Nuremberg between two rival concepts of international justice – that of “crimes against humanity” and “genocide”, each articulated by two well-established lawyers with links to Lviv, Hersch Lauterpacht and Raphael Lemkin.

The former wanted to establish that the Nazis were guilty of crimes against humanity: the killing of vast numbers of individuals. The latter sought to arraign them for genocide: the deliberate attempt to destroy a racial or religious group. Their arguments have echoed across the 70 years since as a system of international law has gradually, falteringly been developed.



The marriage of the public and the personal, he says, made the book difficult to write. At one point he proposed separating the two strands, but his agent argued against. “She said this is the first book that melds the two. It’s not just a Holocaust family horror story and it’s not just the Nuremberg trials story, both of which have been done.”

Writing the book put Sands much more in touch with his Jewishness. It has given him a greater sense of stability: he now understands where his mother’s family came from and has unlocked secrets never revealed by his grandparents. But the intellectual conundrum presented by the book has disquieted him.



He draws my attention to the final paragraph. He even reads it out to me. It describes a visit to a clearing near Lviv where 3,500 Jews – including one of his grandfather’s uncles and an uncle of the Nuremberg lawyer Lauterpacht – had been murdered and buried in a mass grave. “Right there, for a brief moment, I understood,” he writes.



What he means is that he understood that this was a genocide, that Lemkin’s argument is hard to counter. “The issue at the heart of the book is the relationship between the individual and the group, between crimes against humanity and genocide. It’s a question we all ask. Am I an individual? Do I want to be understood and recognised as an individual? Or am I a member of a group?”



Previously, he knew where he stood. “Intellectually, I am with Lauterpacht. I want to be treated as Philippe Sands individual, not Philippe Sands Brit, Londoner or Jew. But then I’m told about this mass grave in Żółkiew, where Lauterpacht is from, where my great-grandmother is from. I visit it and realise Lemkin had something – that we are defined by the community, the group, the tribe, of which we are a member.”



Sands dislikes the nationalism he knows can spring from those bonds of group identity, but he also recognises their power. “I know it to be dangerous, which is why I resist it. The book is about identity. It’s about who we are and how the law should unfurl its protective embrace. Do you want to be protected because of who you are as an individual, or because you happen to be a member of a group that is hated at a particular moment and needs protection? That’s a big question to which there is no simple answer.”

Chagos islanders who were expelled in the 1960s to make way for military bases will not be allowed to return to their Indian Ocean homes, the British Foreign Office has announced, citing the UK’s interest in its “defence relationship” with the US.



Confirmation of the ban on resettlement follows decades of unsuccessful legal challenges in the UK against removal by members of the Chagossian community who have been resettled in Britain.

Responding on Wednesday to the Foreign Office decision, the community threatened fresh legal action to rectify what it branded a “shameful decision”.

Tom Guha, the chair of the UK Chagos Support Association, said: “We are profoundly saddened by the fact that the government have today squandered a perfect opportunity to right this historical wrong. This is a shameful decision and will be remembered as such in the history books. The government will continue to pay the price – not only in ongoing litigation fees – but in a deepened moral deficit.”

Announcing the long-awaited decision, the Foreign Office minister Baroness Joyce Anelay said there would be a £40m support package over the next decade to help exiled islanders improve their lives. 



“The government has decided against resettlement of the Chagossian people to the British Indian Ocean Territory on the grounds of feasibility, defence and security interests, and cost to the British taxpayer,” she told parliament.

The difficulties in re-establishing “a small remote community on low-lying islands” and developing modern public services for them were too great, she explained. There would be “limited healthcare and education” and a lack of jobs and economic opportunities. 



Anelay added: “The government has also considered the interaction of any potential community with the US Naval Support Facility – a vital part of our defence relationship.

“The manner in which the Chagossian community was removed from the territory in the 1960s and 1970s, and the way they were treated, was wrong and we look back with deep regret.”

Despite the community’s “emotional ties to BIOT [British Indian Ocean Territory] and their desire to go back to their former way of life”, the government would instead seek to support the communities where they now live.

As many as 1,500 Chagossians, mainly descendants of those forcibly removed more than half a century ago, had claimed the right to return. In the UK, most Chagossians live near Crawley in Sussex; other refugees have settled in Mauritius and the Seychelles, nearer to their Indian Ocean home.

Reacting to the decision on Wednesday, David Snoxell, who was deputy commissioner for BIOT in the 1990s, said: “A small-scale resettlement could have been tried and 15 years of deception, litigation, wasted public funds and damage to the UK’s human rights reputation avoided. Judges at all levels have deplored the treatment of the Chagossian population since 2000. 

“I cannot recall any other issue, at least in the 35 years that I was in the diplomatic service, which has so let down the FCO, undermined our ethical standards, been so carelessly and unsympathetically handled and caused so much unnecessary anguish than this one. I still feel ashamed at the way the FCO has treated and tricked a people whom we had a sacred duty to protect.”

The Foreign Office is to expand its series of “heritage visits” for native Chagossians, allowing them to return for brief trips so that they can retain links to the atolls. The last visit took place in 2014. FCO officials will meet Chagossians in the UK, Mauritius and the Seychelles in the coming days to discuss arrangements for further visits.



The US is to be granted a further 20-year lease to use the military base on the largest island, Diego Garcia, when it comes up for renewal at the end of this year.

Referring to the lease, Lady Anelay said: “The agreements underpinning the UK/US defence facility will roll over automatically on 31 December if neither side breaks silence. 



“In an increasingly dangerous world, the defence facility is used by us and our allies to combat some of the most difficult problems of the 21st century including terrorism, international criminality, instability and piracy. I can today confirm that the UK continues to welcome the US presence, and that the agreements will continue as they stand until 30 December 2036.”

Human rights groups have claimed that the Diego Garcia base was used for rendition flights involving jihadi suspects, including during the transfer of the Libyan dissident Abdul Hakim-Belhaj to Tripoli in 2004. The Foreign Office denied that he was ever held on the island. 



An FCO spokesperson said: “With the exception of the two previously reported flights that transited through Diego Garcia in 2002, since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the United States has not held or transited any detainees through the territorial land, air or seas of the United Kingdom or its territories.”

Responding to the government’s decision, the UK Chagos Support Association said: “The consideration of such a proposal was unprecedented. It followed a consultation with Chagossians which displayed 98% support for resettlement and a government-commissioned feasibility study which deemed resettlement practically feasible.

“Chagossians were forced from their Indian Ocean homeland as part of a UK-US agreement to build a military base on the Chagos Islands in the early 1970s. As that agreement expires this year, Chagossians and their supporters have called for any extension to be conditional on support for Chagossian return.”

The Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, a long-term supporter of allowing the Chagossians to return, said: “This government has today failed to deliver the justice owed to the Chagossians, wholly innocent of anything, abominably treated and brutally removed from their homes.

“Today’s decision should be seen as nothing less than a fundamental denial of a basic human right. There remains no legal basis for preventing the Chagossians’ return.”

The broadcaster Ben Fogle, the association’s patron, said: “It’s another heartbreaking day for the Chagossian community, who have repeatedly been betrayed and abused by their own government. That even now, with so many reasons to support their return, the government have failed to do the right thing makes this a dark day in our country’s history.”

The poet Benjamin Zephaniah, also a patron, said: “Once again, the people of the Chagos Islands are met with injustice. Sadly today’s decision is just another familiar scenario in a long and tragic episode of British foreign policy.”

The Independent Police Complaints Commission is asking the high court to quash its own report clearing police officers of any serious wrongdoing following the death of a man shortly after he was Tasered.

Jordan Begley, 23, a factory worker from Gorton, Manchester, died in July 2013 two hours after being shot at his home with a 50,000-volt stun gun from a distance of 70cm (28in). He was also punched and restrained by armed officers, who believed he had a knife.

In the first case of its kind, lawyers for the IPCC told two judges sitting in London that the report on the investigation into Begley’s death was legally flawed and there should be “a new and lawful” investigation.

The 2014 report under challenge concluded that no officers should be prosecuted or face misconduct proceedings. The officers involved are opposing the IPCC request to have the report overturned.

Jeremy Johnson QC, appearing for both the IPCC and its chief executive, said there had been “a serious departure” from statutory requirements, and the investigator who prepared the report had not applied the correct legal test and had not accurately summarised the evidence, or attached or referred to all relevant documents from the investigation.

The QC told Lord Justice Elias and Mr Justice Males that a new investigation was the appropriate way of vindicating the right of Dorothy Begley, the mother of the dead man, to a proper inquiry under article 2 of the European convention on human rights.

An inquest jury delivered a narrative verdict in July 2015, saying Begley had been “inappropriately and unreasonably” Tasered and restrained. The jury found officers were “more concerned with their own welfare” than Begley’s.

Ms Begley, who attended the high court hearing on Wednesday, said: “It has been more than three years and I am still fighting for someone to say sorry for destroying my family and taking my son’s life.

“I will fight on no matter how long it takes. I will never give up.”

Johnson said the 2014 report had inadequately dealt with evidence on whether the five officers involved should face misconduct proceedings. 

The report did not summarise contradictory statements from the officers on the position of Begley’s hands before he was Tasered. 



The issue was potentially important to the question of whether the officers’ use of force was justified because of fears that Begley had a knife when they were called to his home, said Johnson. 



One officer had said Begley’s hands were in his pockets while another said they were clenched in fists. 



The report also did not summarise evidence that one of the officers had said he delivered two “distraction strikes” to Begley and that this “knocked the wind” out of him while efforts were continuing to subdue him. This was also relevant to the question of whether excessive force had been used.

Johnson argued that these failures in the report meant Greater Manchester police and the IPCC commissioner did not have a sufficient summary of the evidence to make the decisions they were required to make.

Hugh Davies QC, appearing for the officers, argued that no compelling basis had been demonstrated for a reinvestigation.

He said: “No credible witness has established a case of misconduct against the officers during what was a violent and threatening event.” There was no dispute over the level of threat posed by Begley, and that was why his mother had called the police.

“On any view of the evidence, Jordan Begley represented a serious threat to members of the public outside and may have been armed with a knife,” said the QC. “Police are trained to treat somebody suspected of having a knife as having one until the contrary is demonstrated.”

Davies said a further investigation would be unfair because of the delay involved. Four of the officers had already been placed on restricted duties, on and off, for more than three years at an important stage of their careers.

Reserving judgment, Elias said the court would take time to consider its decision.

I have a doctorate from a great university; I’ve worked on government research projects, and have more published work than many tenured staff. I have been hourly-paid for about five years now, but HR departments have been alert enough to knock me out of the system before I could rack up four years and become semi-permanent.

I’ve been working for three places at once for most of those years. You have three HR systems and three intranets and three security systems, each with their glitches and perversities.

The negotiation of all that stuff – just getting paid is far from automatic – stacks up to something like a management role. But of course this is without the security or the reward or pay being put in automatically. It’s often like trying to play Tetris very fast, and then you look at what you’re doing all this for and it’s three hours one week, seven another, none the next week.

I earn just over £6,000 a year. My pay always just reduces my benefits, which is now universal credit. It’s hard to get by. Then friends and sometimes even students say things like: “Ah, it’s all right for you being a university lecturer …”

We are seasonal labourers, like fruit pickers. You have to email every September, cap in hand, saying: ‘Is there any work for me this year?’ Universities are giving their hourly-paid people less hours, therefore paying them less.

I do struggle to get by. I live in a housing co-op. On a day-to-day basis it means getting big bags of pulses and rice from Asian supermarkets, as cheaply as possible, making a whole batch of something and living off it. I cycle everywhere. It’s absolutely no frills. I’ve got a partner. We would like a family, but it would be extremely difficult. And the idea of getting a mortgage is a non-starter.

The reason I am willing to be named here is because there is little left at stake, not much left to lose; the idea that if I be nice and polite about the situation and don’t say anything I might progress is clearly not true.

I obtained my PhD in 2013 from a Russell Group university. Since then I have worked in three different universities, have taught on seven different modules, and have been module leader for five of these modules.

I love working in [higher education] but, having had a succession of casualised contracts as an hourly-paid lecturer, am finding it increasingly unsustainable for both financial and personal reasons.

I am not making enough money to make rent, particularly in the summer, and have to freelance as an editor and proofreader, which eats into time I really should be using to develop my own research and publications. I am unable to make long-term plans because I don’t know where – or if – I’ll have work next year.

At the moment I face long commutes and/or sleeping on friends’ spare beds, sofas, floors or beanbags the night before I teach. There’s no point in moving closer to work because I might be working at the other end of the country in six months.

Buying a house is out of the question. I have moved back in with my parents in order to save even my meagre rent. The best time was when I was teaching two courses a semester and doing MA supervision – I was earning £6,000-8,000 a year. Sometimes it’s as low as £2,000-3,000.

Casualised contracts do not always pay you for office hours or sufficiently pay you for teaching preparation. You are rarely paid for the hours of emailing and advising students outside the days you are working. It becomes a difficult juggling act between supporting your students and paying yourself.

On a personal level, I’ve experienced serious mental health issues and, while I have worked very hard at getting to a point where I can function, unstable work without a network of colleagues and without any security is proving really difficult.

Three years of temporary contracts have meant that my life has been on hold. My friends outside academia are settling down, buying houses and getting married. Meanwhile, I have a PhD, a book that’s too expensive for anyone other than a university library to buy and face constant uncertainty.

I’m worried that casualised academic labour means that the only ones who get permanent academic jobs are those able to tough out several years of fraught, unstable work – and I worry that the people able to do that are those with considerable financial privileges, without caring responsibilities, without financial dependents and those mentally resilient enough to cope.”

Sam is a pseudonym.

“I got my PhD in 1997 in English literary theory. I worked for about six years at various universities on a series of temporary contracts. I then had my daughter and was made redundant from the last of those contracts.

I was at home for five years with my daughter, then I returned to work as a lecturer at Staffordshire University on a series of temporary contracts including full-time and part-time; my underlying permanent contract remains hourly-paid.

My life is OK because my husband earns a decent wage but I certainly could not support myself on what I earn. Plus there’s the issue of insecurity – the fact that your hours can be cut. My hours have been cut. I have been on occasion quite depressed by the situation.

I was only doing five or so hours a week last year. This semester I’m only teaching two hours a week. The hourly-paid lecturing rate includes payment for half an hour preparation and half an hour marking for each hour of face-to-face teaching. If I was preparing a course I have not taught before I would often spend a day preparing for a lecture and a seminar or a workshop.

I earn such a pathetic amount. It’s ignominious. I feel quite humiliated – the remuneration and the status of the job is much lower than it is for full-time equivalent colleagues. There’s a lack of career progression, a lack of status and not much money.

I’m in a sense lucky. I’m not on my uppers. I can work for little money, but for other people who need to support a family, I can’t imagine how they manage. Everybody is scrabbling around trying to find work.

My husband is a professor of philosophy. He is the one with the proper job. It’s not unusual, but it’s not very good on the feminist front.”

Russia has said it is formally withdrawing its signature from the founding statute of the international criminal court, a day after the court published a report classifying the Russian annexation of Crimea as an occupation.

The repudiation of the tribunal, though symbolic, is a fresh blow to efforts to establish a global legal order for pursuing genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.

In recent months, three African countries who were all full members of the ICC – South Africa, Burundi and Gambia – have signalled their intention to pull out, following complaints that ICC prosecutions focused excessively on the African continent.

The Russian foreign ministry made the announcement on Wednesday on the orders of the president, Vladimir Putin, saying the tribunal had failed to live up to hopes of the international community and denouncing its work as “one-sided and inefficient”.

Russia signed the Rome statute in 2000 and cooperated with the court, but had not ratified the treaty and thus remained outside the ICC’s jurisdiction. This means that the latest move, though highly symbolic, will not change much in practice.

“This is a symbolic gesture of rejection, and says a lot about Russia’s attitude towards international justice and institutions,” said Tanya Lokshina of Human Rights Watch (HRW). “On a practical level it will not make much difference, but it is a statement of direction: it shows that Russia no longer has any intention of ratifying the treaty in future or of cooperating with the court.”



In January, the Russian foreign ministry said it would reconsider its attitude to the court after rulings on the 2008 war between Russia and Georgia.



At the time, the foreign ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, said: “Russia stood at the origins of the ICC’s founding, voted for its establishment and has always cooperated with the agency. Russia hoped that the ICC will become an important factor in consolidating the rule of law and stability in international relations.

“Unfortunately, to our mind, this did not happen. In this regard, and in the light of the latest decision, the Russian federation will be forced to fundamentally review its attitude towards the ICC.”

On Tuesday, the court, which is based in The Hague, published a report that recognised the annexation of Crimea as a military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and classified it as an occupation. 



“According to information received, the situation in the Crimea and Sevastopol is equivalent to the international armed conflict between Ukraine and the Russian federation,” a preliminary report from the ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda stated.

“The Russian federation employed members of its armed forces to gain control over parts of the territory of Ukraine without the consent of the government of Ukraine.” 



Russia has insisted that Crimea voluntarily joined Russia after a referendum, but international observers say the referendum was hastily organised, did not meet international standards, and was conducted as Russian troops swept through the peninsula. Having initially denied vehemently that Russian troops were involved in the takeover, Putin later admitted it.

Russia may also be concerned about ICC jurisdiction in Syria, where its forces have been repeatedly accused of carrying out war crimes in recent months. HRW and other organisations have called for the ICC to investigate events in Syria.

The ICC has struggled to obtain widespread international acceptance. The US, India and China as well as most Middle Eastern states have declined to ratify the Rome statute which established the court. 



About 120 countries, mainly smaller states, have ratified the treaty. The UK is a member of the ICC. The resurgence of nationalist politics, apparent in Brexit and Donald Trump’s presidential election victory, suggests the tide may be turning against international legal institutions.

A spokesperson for the ICC said on Wednesday: “Membership of the Rome Statute is a voluntary and sovereign decision which is the prerogative of all States. Russia signed the Rome Statute in 2000 but did not ratify it and is not a State party. The ICC is respectful of each States’ sovereignty.



“The support of the international community is necessary for the ICC to fulfil its independent and impartial mandate to help end impunity for the perpetrators of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes, provide justice to the victims of such crimes and contribute to the prevention of future atrocities.” 



Speaking on Wednesday at the annual assembly in The Hague of states parties signed up to the Rome Statute, Fatou Bensouda, the court’s chief prosecutor, said she deplored recent withdrawals from the Rome Statute. “Any act that may undermine the global movement towards greater accountability for atrocity crimes and a ruled-based international order in this new century is surely – when objectively viewed – regrettable,” she said.

The ICC’s president, Judge Silvia Fernández de Gurmendi, who is an Argentinian, said: “The court has continued to do the work for which it was created and has made significant achievements in addressing crimes of concern to the international community as a whole such as the use of child soldiers, sexual violence in conflict, attacks on civilians and the destruction of cultural property.

International criminal justice, she added, is “a long-term project” and should remain a top priority “in order to bring perpetrators of crimes to justice and protect victims across the world equally”.



Mark Ellis, director of the International Bar Association, said:“Russia’s decision to ‘withdraw’ its signature from the Rome Statute will have little or no impact on the court. Contrary to the government’s statement, Russia has never engaged with the court in any meaningful way and, in fact, has violated the prohibited crimes provisions of the Statute through its military actions in both Georgia and Ukraine. The more serious threat to the [ICC] is the withdrawal of African countries. Unless this alarming tide can be reversed, the court’s own legitimacy will be in peril.”

A supreme court judge has raised the prospect that Theresa May would have to comprehensively replace existing EU legislation before the government could even begin Brexit, in a move that could seriously delay the process.

In a speech that angered leave campaigners, Lady Hale said the supreme court judges could go further than simply forcing May to publish a short piece of legislation to approve the triggering of article 50.

The deputy president of the court said that next month’s case – in which the supreme court will hear the government’s appeal against a high court ruling that MPs must approve the triggering of article 50 – raised “difficult and delicate issues” about the relationship between government and parliament.

“Another question is whether it would be enough for a simple act of parliament to authorise the government to give notice, or whether it would have to be a comprehensive replacement of the 1972 act,” she said in comments to law students in Kuala Lumpur that were published online on Tuesday. The European Communities Act 1972 took the UK into the then European Economic Community.



Hale set out the arguments on both sides of what is expected to be the most constitutionally significant case ever heard by the supreme court. She told the students that while the referendum had produced a majority of 51.9% in favour of leaving the EU, “that referendum was not legally binding on parliament”.

She put forward the argument that the government was likely to make, saying it would suggest: “The basis on which the referendum was undertaken was that the government would give effect to the result. Beginning the process would not change the law.”

The comments come amid reports that the government has prepared a short three-line bill aimed at helping May stick to her March deadline for triggering article 50 if the supreme court ruled that was necessary. Ministers are said to have drawn up short legislation that would be difficult to amend.

Hale is one of 11 judges due to hear the case at the supreme court, which comes after the high court ruling immediately triggered a backlash from some politicians and rightwing media. The Daily Mail described the judges as “enemies of the people”.

The former work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith said Hale had pro-EU views and warned that it was not the job of judges to tell parliament what to do. Duncan Smith said: “This is a very big step. If they were to do this it’s a constitutional crisis. What the judges will decide on at the supreme court is whether or not the government can use its executive powers to trigger article 50.



“It is not their job to tell parliament … how they should go about that business, that’s for parliament to decide.”

He said “the individual concerned” had always opposed Britain leaving the EU, and said that he did not believe that would be a majority view in the supreme court.

The Conservative MP Dominic Raab said: “If judges dip their toes in political waters by making speeches outside the courtroom, they are asking to get splashed back.”

Raab did not question whether the comments suggested which way Hale would sway but argued that she simply should not have made any public comments. “I’m all for democratic debate. But you can’t have it both ways. If such a senior judge muses in public about a pending supreme court judgment, the judiciary can hardly scream blue murder if politicians, the media or public respond,” he said.

After the outcry over the high court ruling, the prime minister was told to calm the “mob”, with the former attorney general Dominic Grieve saying the coverage “started to make one think that one was living in Robert Mugabe’s Zimbabwe”.

Other Brexit supporters also lashed out at Hale’s lecture. Sir Bill Cash, a Tory MP and chairman of the European scrutiny committee, said: “I am astounded that a justice of the supreme court would venture into this territory before hearing the evidence of the case. It appears completely contrary to the proper relationship between the courts and parliament for her to suggest what parliament should do.”

A supreme court spokesman said that Hale was simply presenting the arguments from both sides of the article 50 appeal in an impartial way for an audience of law students as part of a wider lecture on constitutional law, and it was proper for judges to set out arguments in high-profile cases to help public understanding of the issues involved in an even-handed way.

“One of the questions raised in these proceedings is what form of legislation would be necessary for parliament to be able to lawfully trigger article 50, if the government loses its appeal,” the spokesman said. “A number of politicians have raised the same question. Though it was not dealt with explicitly in the high court judgment, it is not a new issue. In no way was Lady Hale offering a view on what the likely outcome might be.”

• This article was amended on 18 November 2016. An earlier version said incorrectly that 51.9% of the British electorate had voted to leave the EU.

People from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds are more likely to be jailed for some crimes than those who are white, according to a government-commissioned report.

While black people are known to be almost four times more likely to be in prison than white people, the study, headed by the Labour MP David Lammy, reveals racial disparities at many stages of arrest, charging, prosecution and imprisonment. 



Lammy, the MP for Tottenham in north London, said: “These emerging findings raise difficult questions about whether ethnic minority communities are getting a fair deal in our justice system. We need to fully understand why, for example, ethnic minority defendants are more likely to receive prison sentences than white defendants. These are complex issues, and I will dig deeper in the coming months to establish whether bias is a factor.”

For example, the report found that young black males are 10.5 times more likely than young white males to be arrested for robbery. In general, black men were more than three times more likely to be arrested than white men.

The comparative figures raise concerns about equal treatment by police and the courts as well as challenging whether differential outcomes are due to causes outside the control of the justice system.

The interim report notes that “black individuals account for about 3% of the total population of England and Wales yet make up about 9% of defendants prosecuted for indictable offences” at crown court.

Lammy’s full report, due next year, was commissioned by David Cameron to investigate evidence of possible prejudice against black defendants and other ethnic minorities in a justice system repeatedly lauded by mainstream politicians as one of the most impartial in the world.

The investigation was given a political boost by Theresa May, who pledged to fight injustice and acknowledged, as she entered Downing Street in July: “If you’re black, you’re treated more harshly by the criminal justice system than if you’re white.”

The inquiry, supported by the justice secretary, Liz Truss, is to be expanded to include a review of ethnic diversity among judges across tribunals, civil and family courts. It has already begun considering judicial ethnic diversity in crown courts.

Disproportional outcomes were particularly noticeable in certain categories of offences. For every 100 white women handed custodial sentences at crown courts for drug offences, the report found, 227 black women were sentenced to custody. For black men, the figure is 141 for every 100 white men.

Among all those found guilty at crown court in 2014, 112 black men were sentenced to custody for every 100 white men. Men from black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds were more than 16% more likely than white men to be remanded in custody, the study’s statistical analysis revealed. Of those convicted at magistrates courts for sexual offences, 208 black men and 193 Asian men received prison sentences for every 100 white men.

One of the most frequent explanations for differential outcomes is that distrust of the justice system encourages ethnic minority defendants to opt for jury trial rather than pleading guilty at magistrates court, where they might receive a lower sentence.

The report confirmed that BAME defendants are more likely than their white counterparts to be tried at crown court: for every 100 young white defendants opting to have a jury trial, 156 young black men choose to do the same. The report also found 152 BAME men pleaded not guilty at crown court for every 100 white men.

Another of the inquiry’s panel members is Shaun Bailey, a Conservative London assembly member. Asked whether he thought there is bias in the justice system, he said: “The institutional figures would suggest that … If you had gone to the black community in the past they would have given this feeling. But these reports are backed up by statistics.

“Because they have less trust in the system, black people think they should trust the public [ie the jury]. It shows they still have trust in the British public. [Outcomes in] the rest of the system would suggest there’s bias.” By opting for a jury trial, Bailey said, black people were trying to redress perceived prejudice.

“One of the things [the UK is] known for around the world is the impartiality of our judiciary. But people have correctly said a small part of it is not impartial.” Bailey welcomed the fact that the government was tackling the issue and noted that the justice system had “not shied away” from the inquiry. “People have been entirely happy to help.” Asked for examples of prejudice, Bailey said: “There are things that are right up with there with Stephen Lawrence.” He declined, however, to give details. 



David Isaac, the chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, who also sits on the panel, said: “I’m worried. It confirms some of the observations that our own research produced.

“Black people are more likely to be the victims of crime yet are treated more harshly in the criminal justice system. This confirms that trend does not just exist but it is more acute than we realised. I don’t think this is overt racism but it’s hard to break down the individual components that produce these statistics.”



Among the report’s other findings were that BAME males are almost five times more likely to be housed in high-security jails for public order offences than white men. Despite a fall in youth detention, 41% of youth prisoners are from ethnic minority backgrounds, compared with 25% 10 years ago.

About 51% of the UK-born BAME population agree that “the criminal justice system discriminates against particular groups”, compared with 35% of the UK-born white population. 



The disparities were not all one way. Young BAME females and adults were less likely to be charged by the Crown Prosecution Service than comparable white groups. BAME men were about 10% less likely to be convicted at crown court than the comparative white group. Asian women were about 20% less likely to be convicted at crown court than white women.

The report, Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic Disproportionality in the Criminal Justice System in England and Wales, said: “For some offences, such as robbery, arrest rates were significantly higher for certain BAME groups, but analyses of court processes generally did not suggest that disproportionality emerged for these groups” at later stages in the justice system.

It added: “One overarching hypothesis worth investigating may be that established principles of oversight, guidance and collective decision-making reduce the effects of any unconscious racial bias that play out in areas of the system where decision-makers exercise a higher degree of individual discretion.”

Welcoming the interim report, Truss said: “I am grateful to David Lammy for his work in this very important area. I welcome his commitment to studying these emerging findings in greater detail, and look forward to his full recommendations next year.

“Part of building a fair justice system that works for everyone is drawing on the best talents from every background in Britain. That’s why I have announced a range of measures to make it easier for talented people to become senior judges based purely on merit, and why I have asked David to broaden his review to cover judicial ethnic diversity across tribunals, civil and family courts.”

People suffering a mental health crisis should never be held in police cells as they find it terrifying and become even more unwell, ministers will be told.

Peers will move an amendment to the policing and crime bill on Wednesday to ensure that adults who are feeling suicidal, are psychotic or are self-harming are never taken to police stations for assessment. It already plans to do that for under-18s.

The number of people to whom that happens has fallen sharply in recent years and the number taken instead to hospitals has risen as a result, after widespread concern about the practice.

“When you’re in a mental health crisis you may become frustrated, frightened and extremely distressed. Your behaviour could be perceived as aggressive and threatening to others, but you desperately need support and compassion,” said Paul Harmer, the chief executive of the mental health charity Mind, which is leading the calls to end the practice.

“Being held in a police cell and [in effect] treated like a criminal only makes things worse. Now is the moment to ban this damaging practice once and for all.”

Figures show there were 2,100 instances of adults being detained under section 136 of the Mental Health Act in police cells in England and Wales during 2015-16, and it also happened with 43 children and young people aged under 18.

West Yorkshire police detained people 269 times in a police cell under section 136 during 2015-16, while Avon and Somerset did it 242 times, and South Wales 192. Officers usually take someone in crisis to a cell only when there is no “place of safety” available in a local NHS hospital.

Yet, the 2,100 figure was 53% fewer than the 4,537 to whom that happened the year before. Numbers fell dramatically during Theresa May’s time as home secretary from 2010. For example, in 2011-12 a total of 9,000 people were taken to police cells after being detained.

Similarly, the number of under-18s taken to a police cell had fallen from 256 in 2013-14 to 43 last year.

Joan Walmsley, a Liberal Democrat peer, will use the Lords debate on Wednesday to try to push through the change.

Insp Wayne Goodwin, Kent constabulary’s mental health liaison officer, said: “Kent police believe the use of police cells for those detained under the Mental Health Act should be a never event. Cells are not appropriate places for anyone detained under the act and we know that their use can add to the trauma of the crisis and potentially delay that person’s recovery.”

The Home Office said adults should only be taken to police cells in “exceptional circumstances” but did not comment on the call for a ban.

A spokeswoman said: “We are committed to ensuring those in mental health crisis get compassionate care and that no one is taken to a cell when they have committed no crime and solely because there is no alternative safe place for them. Significant progress has been made by the police and health partners in halving the use of police cells for those in mental health crisis over the last year. But there is still more work to be done. 



“Changes to legislation through the Policing and Crime Bill will ban the use of police cells for under 18s in mental health crisis, and ensure they can only be used as a place of safety for adults in genuinely exceptional circumstances.”

That fake news and misinformation on Facebook could have influenced the outcome of the US presidential election is worrying (Opinion, 15 November), but, in reality, this is only tinkering around the edges of a major problem. The first amendment of the US constitution was designed to protect freedom of the press. However, for the most part, the supreme court has failed to use it to rule on libel cases: hence tabloids such as the National Enquirer can get away with printing pretty much anything they like.

It is possible to police the publishing and broadcasting industry – if nations are willing to do it. Sufficient staff (not robots) need to be employed to fact-check before publishing or broadcasting. Facebook has the power to influence on a macro scale, so it should also come under the same regulation. It certainly can afford the cost of editorial teams to manage its publications. There’s an easy rule: if in doubt, don’t publish. The Guardian already regulates this problem with the polite words: “This comment was removed by a moderator because it didn’t abide by our community standards.” Wikipedia, an open source encyclopedia, successfully regulates itself. Anyone can correct misinformation published on the site and citations are required, with it being very clear when a citation (proof) is missing. Information is democratically tuned in real time.

• In recommending a pre-arrest name suppression regime for suspected sexual offences (Report, theguardian.com, 9 November), Richard Henriques, in his report on Operation Midland, supposes it to be unlikely that the government would sanction an anonymity before charge law, as this “would enrage the popular press whose circulation would suffer”. He is unduly pessimistic. It is true that some newspapers have raised the false spectre of “secret arrests”, but in 2013 no less a figure than David Cameron spoke warmly of the need to protect individuals from “genuinely life-changing publicity”. As home secretary, Theresa May agreed. A significant proportion of arrests on suspicion of having committed serious offences never lead to charge and the lives of many people have been needlessly blighted in consequence of being named in the media. A general ban on publishing the name of a suspect before charge could be lifted in exceptional cases where it was considered likely to encourage other genuine complainants to come forward, but only with advance judicial approval.

The high court has ordered up to 10,000 prison officers to end a 24-hour protest over rising violence in jails and to go back to work after legal action by the justice secretary, Elizabeth Truss.

Mr Justice Kerr granted an injunction on Tuesday afternoon restraining the Prison Officers’ Association (POA) from “inducing any form of industrial action” and reaffirming the legal ban on prison staff striking.

Government lawyers accused the POA of trying to “impose their own limited regime” in jails across England and Wales against the wishes of the Prison Service by taking action that amounted to a strike.

“What they are doing is seeking to take over the control of jails from governors and run them on a controlled lock-down basis,” said Daniel Stilitz QC, counsel for the Ministry of Justice. “Each hour that goes by with the prisons unmanned, the danger ramps up.”

The POA said on Tuesday evening that it had asked its members to comply with the court order from 5pm. After a “long and very difficult day” it said it had achieved its aim of securing a meeting with the justice secretary within the next 48 hours.

The union had insisted that the 24-hour protest, which included a provision for emergency cover, was necessary to keep staff and inmates safe in the face of a surge in jail violence and a prison system in “meltdown”.

After the ruling, a Ministry of Justice spokeswoman said an immediate return to work was expected: “The injunction prevents the POA and any of its officials including local officials from inducing, authorising or supporting any form of industrial action by any prison officer which would disrupt the normal running of the prison service in England and Wales.

The injunction came after Truss had condemned the protest as “unlawful industrial action”. She told the Commons the 24-hour walkout, which had been due to end at midnight on Tuesday, was putting more people in danger.

Truss called Labour’s refusal to join her in condemning the POA a “disgrace”, and accused the union of walking away from talks and taking action without any notice.



The protest has disrupted hundreds of trials across the country, including at the Old Bailey and the court of appeal in London. Among these was that of Thomas Mair, the man accused of murdering the Labour MP Jo Cox.

The shadow justice secretary, Richard Burgon, did not respond to Truss’s demand that he condemn the POA, instead blaming her for refusing to recognise there was a prisons crisis that she could not control.

The Conservative chair of the justice select committee, Bob Neill, joined Truss in condemning the POA action but asked her to recognise that there was an underlying issue of prison officer morale and the loss of many experienced staff.

Though emergency cover is being provided, the POA action at every jail in England and Wales means prisoners are being kept in their cells – a situation described as dangerous by the chief executive of the National Offender Management Service, Michael Spurr.

Spurr said the prison officers’ protest amounted to a strike, which the POA is banned from taking by law. The Ministry of Justice is to ask the courts to ban the 24-hour protest action.



“We will be seeking relief from the courts later today … Rather than talk to us the prison officers have taken protest action, which by any other means would be classed as industrial action. They are not working. Prisoners are not being unlocked and that is a dangerous situation,” he said.

He was supported by Sir Martin Narey, the former director-general of the prison service, who said the POA action had come after Truss had undertaken “a massive reversal of inept staffing cuts”. He called the POA action “hard to fathom, impossible to support”.

The union’s instructions to its members asked them to stage protest action outside their jails for 24 hours until midnight on Tuesday. Emergency cover was being negotiated at each prison to deal with fires, incidents of self-harm, issuing essential medication to prisoners, hospital bed watches and maintaining unit patrols. Each POA branch was asked to negotiate on a jail-by-jail basis on an action plan to establish minimum safety levels.



The protests also led to the cancellation of a Commons justice select committee hearing during which MPs were to hear evidence from prison governors on the government’s safety and reform programme outlined by Truss two weeks ago.

The POA said it had consistently raised the “volatile and dangerous state of prisons, as chronic staff shortages and impoverished regimes has resulted in staff no longer being safe, a lack of discipline and prisoners taking control of areas”.

The statement from its national executive said the continued surge in violence and unprecedented levels of suicide and acts of self-harm, coupled with recent murder and escapes, showed that the system was in meltdown.

Dave Todd, the POA south-east representative, was outside Pentonville prison in London, where there was a recent jailbreak. He said conditions in jails were “volatile and dangerous”. “We need to act to protect ourselves. It has not come about quickly, it’s a build-up over probably years actually. It’s just unsafe. To me, prison officers taking this type of action speaks volumes for what’s happening inside,” he said.

Todd, a former soldier, added: “I served in Northern Ireland and I felt more vulnerable walking the landings in prisons than I did on the streets of Northern Ireland.”



The MoJ said there was no justification for the action: “We have been engaged in constructive talks with the POA over the last two weeks and have provided a comprehensive response to a range of health and safety concerns.

“The government has announced an additional 2,500 frontline officers to help reduce violence in prisons. We have well-established contingencies in place to manage prisons and keep the public safe, but we are clear that this constitutes unlawful industrial action, and we will seek remedy in the courts.”

An Amnesty International poster campaign aimed at highlighting how the Human Rights Act has helped causes as disparate as the Hillsborough families and the Northern Ireland peace process has been banned by Network Rail as too political, the rights group has said.

Amnesty said on Tuesday it was disappointed that posters booked for rail stations around the country had been pulled, even though Transport for London had run them at an underground station.

Network Rail confirmed it had pulled the posters, saying they did not meet its rules on political advertising, in part because they directed people towards an online petition against government plans to scrap the act.

The Amnesty campaign, which has also run in print and online, uses people who have been involved in cases involving the Human Rights Act, including relatives of those who died in the 1989 Hillsborough disaster, people connected with the Northern Ireland peace process, a couple whose son died because of hospital blunders and a woman who fought to uncover police errors after her mother was murdered.

The government has committed to repealing the act, passed in 1998 under Tony Blair’s government to incorporate the European convention on human rights into UK law. Ministers have pledged to replace it with a bill of rights, though the timetable for this process remains vague.

Amnesty said it had arranged for the cancelled posters to be displayed at other sites.

Kate Allen, Amnesty’s UK director, said: “We’re very disappointed by Network Rail’s decision to pull these adverts at the 11th hour. We simply don’t accept that basic human rights are ever a political issue.

“The irony is that human rights cross party-political lines and so do failures, coverups and abuses. Successive governments managed to let down the Hillsborough families, and their story demonstrates precisely why we need enduring human rights protections which aren’t redrafted by the government of the day, on a political whim.”

A Network Rail spokeswoman said: “We first saw the adverts yesterday and on inspection, they don’t meet our rules on ‘political’ advertising. We aim to be fair and even-handed when deciding which adverts to accept in our stations and have a set of rules in place to ensure all advertising is treated equally.

“The advertisement directs people to sign an online petition, and it is for this reason we deemed it political and against our rules.”

The decision prompted criticism from activists, and people associated with the Amnesty campaign.

Barry Devonside, whose 18-year-old son, Christopher, died at Hillsborough, said the decision was small-minded, adding: “Human rights aren’t political; they cover everyone, right across society.”

Introducing the campaign on Tuesday, Becky Shah, whose mother, Inger, also died at Hillsborough, said the act had been crucial in securing the second inquest into the deaths, which recorded that the victims were unlawfully killed.

Under the act, a jury can be convened to assess the wider circumstances surrounding a death – something that had not been legislated for before it came into law.

Shah said: “Without the Human Rights Act we would never, ever have had the second inquest. Without the Human Rights Act we would never, ever have got the verdicts of unlawfully killed against all the parties that were culpable. It was an absolutely imperative piece of legislation.”

Other people involved include Gary McKinnon, who successfully fought extradition to the US on hacking charges, and the parents of John Robinson, who died in 2006 from a ruptured spleen after doctors at Stafford hospital sent him home even though he was vomiting and semi-conscious. It took a second inquest into Robinson’s death in 2014 to uncover the scale of the errors.

“It’s fundamental to everyone, in all walks of life,” Frank Robinson said of the act. “It opens access to justice for the man in the street. From the outset, all we wanted to know was the truth, and we were denied that by an inadequate first inquest. Using the Human Rights Act helped us achieve our goal.”

The number of workers in the UK in precarious positions where they could lose their jobs at short or no notice has grown by almost 2 million in the past decade, as businesses insist on using more self-employed workers and increasingly recruit staff on temporary and zero-hours contracts, analysis for the Guardian has revealed.

More than one in five workers, some 7.1 million people, now face precarious employment conditions that mean they could lose their work suddenly – up from 5.3 million in 2006, according to analysis of official figures conducted by John Philpott, a leading labour market economist. Half of the biggest group – the self-employed – are in low pay and take home less than two-thirds of the median earnings, according to the Resolution Foundation thinktank. Two million self-employed people now earn below £8 per hour.

The extent of the precarious work phenomenon emerges as a Downing Street-commissioned inquiry into modern employment practices gears up. Amid growing concern about the social impact of a workforce increasingly divided between low-paid, low-skilled and insecure work and higher-paid, higher-skilled employment, the Guardian is publishing a series of articles on the consequences of the change for the kind of workers described by Theresa May as “just managing”.

The government is concerned that the lack of training offered in precarious work, particularly in self-employment, is “completely backward”, according to a No 10 source. The fear is that it entrenches low pay and hinders career progression to higher earnings.

Meanwhile, 750,000 more people are on zero-hours contracts than in 2006, and 207,000 more people are working as temps, according to Philpott’s analysis of the government’s labour force survey. Some of the zero hours workers may also be included in the temp count – 32% in the most recent set of figures.

“There is something profound going on and all of this poses a potential risk to social cohesion and a risk to the potential for social mobility,” Alan Milburn, the chairman of the government’s commission into social mobility, told a recent event on precarious working.

The issue has also been prioritised at the Trades Union Congress, which has launched a review of the scale and nature of vulnerable work in Britain.

Companies such as Argos and Tesco use thousands of agency temps. Sainsbury is now using 54 different employment agencies for its temporary warehouse workers. The taxi company Uber and courier firms Hermes and Yodel are among firms relying on 4.7 million “self-employed” workers, although Uber recently lost a landmark employment tribunal case when judges ruled that its self-employed drivers should be treated as workers and paid the “national minimum wage”, enjoy paid holidays and get sick pay.

Anxiety about low pay is running so high that more than 10,000 people called the Acas minimum wage helpline in the five months to September concerned they were not receiving the statutory minimum – a 73% increase on the same period last year, according to figures released to the Guardian. The UK currently has a greater proportion of full-time employees in low pay than all but seven of the 22 developed nations in the OECD.

“The rise in self-employment has been hailed as part of the economy’s success story in the recovery, but for thousands of people it can mask some worrying trends – namely being forced into precarious, low-paid work,” said Ashwin Kumar, chief economist at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. He pointed out that self-employed families were more likely to live in poverty, with a median income of £209 a week against £384 for employees.

Vulnerable work does not always mean poor pay and conditions, but while many workers choose self-employment or temporary contracts, earnings on average are much lower. Self-employed workers typically earn about half the wage of permanent employees, zero-hours contractors about 40% and temp workers around two-thirds, Philpott said in his analysis for the Guardian, although this is complicated by the variability of hours worked.

The impact of the changes to pay is not spread evenly across the UK. An estimated one in four of all workers in the Greater Lincolnshire area, for example, is forecast to be earning near or below the national living wage or the national minimum wage by 2020 – an increase from one in 10 in 2015, according to analysis by the Resolution Foundation. Other areas badly affected include London, Nottingham, Liverpool and the Tees valley.

The human impact of the phenomenon is also becoming clear. Last year, a review of studies around the world published in the BMC Public Health journal concluded that job insecurity posed a comparable threat to health as unemployment – and that anticipating a job loss could actually have a more significant effect than experiencing it.

Young adults have been hit hardest by the long-term trend. The proportion of working 16- to 20-year-olds in low pay rose from 58% in 1990 to 77% in 2015, while the proportion aged 21 to 25 rose from 22% to 40%, according to Resolution Foundation analysis. Older workers have become less likely to endure low pay.



The attractions of flexible or insecure contracts are considerable to employers and they dispute many of the downsides that unions, workers and analysts have highlighted.

Deliveroo is a multinational company that relies on 8,000 self-employed workers in the UK to deliver takeaway meals by bicycle. By contrast, in the Netherlands and Germany it directly employs 1,500 couriers, which might suggest that its business model, in those countries at least, is not reliant on self-employment. Lawyers for several Deliveroo riders in the UK are at the early stages of considering making a claim against the company for false self-employment, something Deliveroo denies.

But Deliveroo describes its riders as “independent suppliers” and in a statement a spokesman said this status was because “the flexibility this offers is important to them”.

It is not just insurgent tech companies that use large numbers of non-staff workers to deliver their core services. Tesco, Britain’s biggest supermarket chain, said between 35% and 40% of its warehouse workers – some 6,000 – are provided by agencies.

For many of our biggest brands, employment arrangements resemble a Russian doll. Amazon relies on thousands of self-employed workers to deliver its parcels and subcontracts to companies such as Hermes and Yodel, which subcontract to thousands more couriers themselves.

For warehouse workers who are not directly employed, Sainsbury uses a similar multilayered arrangement. It has a contract with De Poel, an agency services provider, which in turn manages contracts with employment agencies, which then hire staff. Sainsbury says the vast majority of these workers have full-time contracts but some drivers are on limited-hours contracts, something the retailer says it is monitoring with the agencies.

“Like all large retailers, working with agencies allows our distribution network to accommodate business needs – Christmas being the obvious example,” a spokesperson said.

That argument about fluctuating demand is a powerful one for many companies. “One of the attractions of flexible contract options for businesses is being able to meet more volatile demand patterns in increasingly 24/7 markets,” said Neil Carberry, director for people and skills at the Confederation of British Industry. Nonetheless, he insists that the trend is not significant. “There have been claims that the mass casualisation of the British labour market is around the corner for 30 years. But the need to retain talent and build productivity in companies mean that directly employed staff will always be the majority of our labour market.”

“No form of contract is inherently problematic,” he added. “It is about how companies deal with their staff … The key thing is good management, and businesses are committed to doing that well.”

Some of the 7.2 million workers now in precarious employment might disagree that is always the case.

Norma, a mother of three from Rotherham, has been juggling three self-employed jobs to try to make ends meet. She worked six days a week delivering parcels for Yodel, which earned her between £400 and £800 a month before paying her car expenses; she delivered 500 newspapers a week for Whistl, earning about £25 a week; and she ran her own small online business selling cross-stitch craft kits she assembled in her conservatory.

“It was a fine balancing act for the family,” she said. “I never knew how much money was going to be in the bank. If it was a slow month I would be worried about finding extra work from somewhere. I couldn’t make the money I needed in the time I’d got.”

Yaseen Aslam, a former Uber driver, is also self-employed – but succeeded along with another driver in challenging that status at a recent employment tribunal. .

“When I first started minicab driving eight years ago, I used to do 30 hours a week and took home £500 after expenses,” said Aslam, a 35-year-old married father of three from High Wycombe.

“I was self-employed and I felt self-employed. Over time we have lost control of what we were making. There were lots of advance bookings but with technology things changed. We have no sense of what we were going to be making, the prices fell and more drivers came on to the streets. I was getting between £50 and £100 per day before expenses, which was much less. I didn’t have any quality family time and I was busy working all the time just to pay my bills.”

He has found another form of self-employment, again enabled by the internet: trading merchandise on eBay from his home.

We write to address the central misrepresentation in Helena Pozniak’s article (The criminology course opening the door to education for prisoners, theguardian.com, 9 November) regarding UK prison education programmes.

Pozniak’s article details a UK initiative which features the hallmarks of a US programme established 20 years ago. The Inside-Out prison education programme’s recognised characteristics include Inside (prison) students joining with Outside (university) students to engage in a transformative learning experience within prison, in an atmosphere of mutual respect, with rules of conduct explicitly agreed at the start. All students complete the same readings and assessments, engage in weekly academic discussions about criminal justice and related issues, and obtain a certificate recognising their successful completion at a closing ceremony. Professor Lori Pompa established Inside-Out 20 years ago in the US in collaboration with men incarcerated in Graterford Correctional Facility, Philadelphia, many of whom are serving life sentences without parole and who continue, with Pompa, to offer intensive training to any academic wishing to roll out this unique model of community-based education. With more than 500 Inside-Out instructors and 20,000 alumni across the US, Australia, and Europe, Pompa will this month receive the American Society of Criminology lifetime achievement award for teaching in recognition of her efforts. We welcome the contribution that any UK colleagues make in developing prison education opportunities here but urge them to acknowledge Inside-Out and the role it has played in shaping their project if drawing so heavily upon it.

Of the documents that set out the legal and policy framework for the drone campaign, the three posted below are among the most significant. In late 2009 or early 2010, the justice department’s Office of Legal Counsel orally approved the targeting of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen. In two memos – one dated February 2010 and the other July 2010 – the Office of Legal Counsel sought to justify the authorization it had already given. An American drone strike killed Anwar al-Awlaki the following September, and another killed his 16-year-old American son two weeks later. In the spring of 2013, Barack Obama signed Presidential Policy Guidance meant to regularize the drone campaign. That document, which the American Civil Liberties Union obtained through litigation earlier this year, provides the policy framework for drone strikes carried out by the United States today.

The government has demonstrated a “signal breach of faith” in cutting the pensions of recently appointed judges, an employment tribunal has been told.

Presenting a claim on behalf of six high court judges against the Ministry of Justice, Michael Beloff QC said it was irrelevant that they earned more than most other public sector workers or that “there is a need to cut public expenditure”. High court judges get a salary of about £180,000 a year.

What was significant, he said, was that older judges were allowed to retain more generous pension arrangements while younger judges had suffered a “double whammy” because their payments on retirement had been reduced and a harsher tax regime had been introduced.

As well as the six high court judges, another 204 crown court judges, district judges, sheriffs and tribunal judges are jointly challenging the MoJ’s pension cuts.

The six high court claimants are Sir Nicholas Mostyn, 59, Sir Roderick Newton, 58, Sir Philip Moor, 57, Dame Lucy Theis, 55, Sir Richard Arnold, 55, and Sir Rabinder Singh, 52.

They allege they are being discriminated against on the basis of age. Theis and Singh additionally claim gender and race discrimination respectively. The hearing at the central London employment tribunal is scheduled to last 10 days.

Opening the case, Beloff explained that barristers normally incurred a large drop in income, on average approximately 68%, when they become judges.

He added: “The drop in income is the price paid by those who leave private practice and join the public service.

“What they could not have anticipated is that the terms on which they were appointed in respect of their pensions, which are recognised to be the compensating benefit, would be cut by the government to their substantial financial detriment.”

The old judicial pensions – which before 2012 did not require any employee contributions – provided an income of a 40th of a judge’s final pensionable pay multiplied by his or her length of service. It also gave a lump sump on retirement, after the age of 65, of two and a quarter times the annual rate.

The new judicial pensions include no lump sum payments. They accumulate at the slower rate of a 43rd of the final pensionable pay per year of service, and include contribution rates that are due to rise to up to 8% of pensionable pay. 



Beloff quoted from a letter sent by former lord chancellor Chris Grayling which acknowledged that reform of pensions rights raised “important constitutional principles”.

Beloff said: “Judges are not in the same position as other public sector workers. Judges have a constitutional role which other public sector workers do not face. That is not to disparage other public sector workers. They just work differently. Once embarked on a career as a judge, there’s no turning back. It’s a one-way street.”

No judge can return to the bar or act as a solicitor again after being appointed. Judges are also banned from supplementing their income, he added.

Andrew Short QC, counsel for the 204 other judges in the case represented by the law firm Leigh Day, suggested the idea that older judges should be spared changes because they have less time to adjust before retirement was illogical because the older appointees would be exposed to the changes for a shorter period of time. 



Martin Chamberlain QC, for the lord chancellor and the MoJ, said there was no constitutional principle requiring sitting judges to be insulated from adverse pension changes when other public servants were not.

He told the tribunal it was legitimate to enforce a transitional protection period for those judges who, being closer to retirement, were more likely to have made “concrete plans” about their financial futures based on the existing scheme. 



Chamberlain also outlined alternatives considered by government before legislating the changes, including an “expensive option” of staggering their introduction, which would have cost £4bn in the first year.

US armed forces and the CIA may have committed war crimes by torturing detainees in Afghanistan, the international criminal court’s chief prosecutor has said in a report, raising the possibility that American citizens could be indicted even though Washington has not joined the global court.

“Members of US armed forces appear to have subjected at least 61 detained persons to torture, cruel treatment, outrages upon personal dignity on the territory of Afghanistan between 1 May 2003 and 31 December 2014,” according to the report issued by prosecutor Fatou Bensouda’s office on Monday.

The report adds that CIA operatives may have subjected at least 27 detainees in Afghanistan, Poland, Romania and Lithuania to “torture, cruel treatment, outrages upon personal dignity and/or rape” between December 2002 and March 2008.

Most of the alleged abuse happened in 2003-04, the report says.

Prosecutors said they would decide “imminently” whether to seek authorisation to open a full-scale investigation in Afghanistan that could lead to war crimes charges.

Elizabeth Trudeau, the spokeswoman for the State Department, said the US did not believe an ICC investigation was “warranted or appropriate”.

“The United States is deeply committed to complying with the law of war, and we have a robust national system of investigation and accountability that more than meets international standards,” Trudeau said.

A Pentagon spokesman, Navy Capt Jeff Davis, said officials were awaiting further details about the ICC findings before commenting.

Established in 2002, the international criminal court is the world’s first permanent court set up to prosecute war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. More than 120 countries are members, but superpowers including the US, Russia and China have not signed up.

The former US president Bill Clinton signed the Rome treaty that established the court on 31 Deember 2000, but President George W Bush renounced the signature, citing fears that Americans would be unfairly prosecuted for political reasons.

Even though the US is not a member of the court, Americans could still face prosecution at its headquarters in The Hague if they commit crimes within its jurisdiction in a country that is a member, such as Afghanistan, and are not prosecuted at home.

So far, all of the ICC’s trials have dealt with crimes committed in Africa.

Prosecutors say investigations also are reportedly under way in Poland, Romania and Lithuania, which are all signatories to the Rome statute, into possible crimes at CIA detention facilities in those countries.

The abuse allegations came in a wide-ranging annual report into the prosecution office’s preliminary examinations, which involve studying reports of possible crimes to establish if they fall under the court’s jurisdiction.

The same report says that Taliban and Afghan government forces also may have used torture and committed other atrocities in that country’s long and bitter conflict. The report says the Taliban and its affiliates killed thousands of people and are suspected of committing war crimes including murder, recruiting and conscripting child soldiers and attacking civilians and humanitarian workers.

Referring to the alleged US war crimes, the report says they “were not the abuses of a few isolated individuals. Rather, they appear to have been committed as part of approved interrogation techniques in an attempt to extract ‘actionable intelligence’ from detainees”.

The report adds: “The information available suggests that victims were deliberately subjected to physical and psychological violence, and that crimes were allegedly committed with particular cruelty and in a manner that debased the basic human dignity of the victims.”

Before deciding to open a full-scale investigation, ICC prosecutors have to establish whether they have jurisdiction and whether the alleged crimes are being investigated and prosecuted in the countries involved. The ICC is a court of last resort that takes on cases only when other countries are unable or unwilling to prosecute.

The report notes that US authorities have conducted dozens of investigations and court martial cases and says ICC prosecutors are seeking further clarifications on their scope before deciding whether any American cases would be admissible at the ICC.

After the 9/11 attacks, George W Bush’s administration allowed the use of waterboarding, which simulates drowning, and other enhanced interrogation techniques against suspected terrorists. President Barack Obama banned such practices after taking office in 2009.

During the presidential campaign, the Republican nominee Donald Trump suggested that as president he would push to change laws that prohibit waterboarding and other harsh interrogation techniques, arguing that banning them put the US at a strategic disadvantage against Islamic State militants.

In the early part of this century I gained unauthorised access to government computer systems in the US, in a successful attempt to find evidence of official knowledge of the UFO phenomenon. What followed was a decade-long nightmare. I slipped further and further into depression as the years wore on, having to take Prozac and regularly see a therapist. The emotional wear and tear on my family was one of the worst parts, watching them fight and mostly lose for 10 years.

I was arrested in March 2002 for the crime of unauthorised access, which at that time carried a maximum penalty of six months’ imprisonment. The American and British authorities delayed any criminal proceedings seemingly so that they had time to bring in the US-UK extradition treaty, which seemed almost tailor-made for my case and others like it. This treaty was drawn up (in American spelling …) in 2003, but not ratified by the US until 2006. Despite this some people (including the NatWest Three) were extradited under it prior to ratification.

All the US had to do was accuse someone of something and that was that. This couldn’t happen to a US citizen under the same treaty, since they are afforded the protection of their constitution.

We were told there was no evidence of the alleged damage, and yet we still had to fight against these accusations. When a case like that goes on for years it wears you down more and more on a daily basis. My life was on hold, as I sank ever deeper into depression. Then, one day in 2008, things started to change.

After being interviewed on ITV, quite a few people watching – including a woman who had Asperger’s syndrome, a condition on the autistic spectrum – thought that I was displaying classic signs of the same condition. This view tallied with many mental health professionals who were watching and took the time to communicate their feelings to my solicitors.

People had always commented that I was odd, at school and at work, but no one ever suggested I might have a condition that needed treatment. I was completely averse to being diagnosed for Asperger’s, since I was already extremely low-spirited and really didn’t want psychologists poking around in my mind. Eventually I gave in and was diagnosed by several of the top people in the field, including Simon Baron-Cohen, who all agreed that I had Asperger’s and that this made me vulnerable.

The thought of being in a foreign jail, in a country where you have been accused of attacking electronic assets at a time when terrorism was an ever-present threat, was terrifying. It had seemed there was no way out after multiple judicial reviews, so I bought enough potassium chloride to stop my heart. This chemical is the third one used in the trio of lethal injection chemicals they use in the US.

I was a hopeless zombie, on Prozac and thinking that one way or the other my life would soon be at an end. But then the Human Rights Act aspect was raised. Was it compatible with my human rights as a vulnerable adult to be thrown into a hostile foreign jail with no evidence of my crimes? We hadn’t had any luck with previous home secretaries – until Theresa May.

A lot happened between the Asperger’s diagnosis in 2008 and our final victory in 2012 – more judicial reviews, appeals to the supreme court, presidents and prime ministers discussing my case on television – but it was all going on far away from me. I felt distanced from everything. In 2012, May courageously and compassionately agreed that extradition to the US was incompatible with my human rights, and blocked the extradition on those grounds. Where extradition legislation failed, the Human Rights Act delivered.

Some in the media have spoken out against the act, providing extreme examples of how it can be misused in an attempt to increase negative feelings towards it, but what we have to remember is this – human rights don’t change. Slavery and forced labour will always be wrongs; freedom of thought, belief and religion will always be rights.

May was then my only hope for protection, and today she is in the unique position of being the only hope for the Human Rights Act itself. I owe my life to her and to the act, and it would be a great shame if the ladder by which I was rescued was kicked away so that the next person who needs it finds it gone.

Unearthing the truth about what happened at Hillsborough in 1989 would have been impossible without the Human Rights Act, according to one of the relatives who successfully fought against the original inquest ruling on the deaths of the 96 victims.

Introducing a campaign in defence of the legislation, Becky Shah, whose mother, Inger, died at Hillsborough, said the act had been crucial in securing the second inquest into the deaths, which recorded that the victims were unlawfully killed.

Under the Human Rights Act, a jury can be convened to assess the wider circumstances surrounding a death – something that had not been legislated for before it came into law.

Shah said: “Without the Human Rights Act we would never, ever have had the second inquest. Without the Human Rights Act we would never, ever have got the verdicts of unlawfully killed against all the parties that were culpable. It was an absolutely imperative piece of legislation.”

Her remarks are at the centre of an Amnesty International campaign warning that if the Human Rights Act is repealed when the UK leaves the EU, there could be miscarriages of justice.

Replacing the act with a UK bill of rights was part of the 2015 Conservative manifesto, but there have been reports that the much-delayed plan could be ditched. In August the justice secretary, Liz Truss, said it would still happen but gave no timeframe for it.

The campaign to save the act has also been backed by the widower of a woman killed by an IRA bomb, and a couple who used the legislation to uncover negligence that had led to their son’s death.

Other people involved include Gary McKinnon, who successfully fought extradition to the US on hacking charges, and a woman who used the act to uncover police errors committed before her mother was murdered.

Shah, whose brother survived the Hillsborough crush, said she was “extremely worried” about what could happen if the act was repealed. She said: “My fear is that if the Human Rights Act were to be abolished and replaced with the British bill of rights, which would be very limited, miscarriages of justice would go back to being far more easily perpetrated by the state.”

Alan McBride, whose wife, Sharon, died in the 1993 Shankill bombing, and who has since worked on community reconciliation, said the act was “extremely important” for the Northern Ireland peace process.

“What the Human Rights Act does is to give a safeguard. If you think you’re not getting anywhere through the normal course of law and order, at least you have this fallback,” he said.

“It’s enshrined in it that if your loved one is murdered you’re entitled to an investigation and be told about where that has got to. Without that, I don’t know where your redress would be.”



McKinnon, whose extradition was eventually blocked partly because he has Asperger’s syndrome, said the act played a key role in his case.

He said: “The Human Rights Act is important because it legislates for the protection of basic freedoms. These freedoms are unchanging, so the act itself should only be added to, not lessened or restricted or done away with.

“The act also gets a lot of bad press, with extreme examples of its use in terror cases, but we shouldn’t let a few bad interpretations get in the way of a necessary act.”



The parents of John Robinson, who died in 2006 from a ruptured spleen after doctors at Stafford hospital sent him home even though he was vomiting and semi-conscious, also support the campaign. It took a second inquest into John’s death in 2014 to uncover the scale of the errors.

“It’s fundamental to everyone, in all walks of life,” Frank Robinson said of the act. “It opens access to justice for the man in the street. From the onset, all we wanted to know was the truth, and we were denied that by an inadequate first inquest. Using the Human Rights Act helped us achieve our goal.”

Asked about plans for a bill of rights, a Ministry of Justice spokeswoman said: “We will set out our proposals for a bill of rights in due course. We will consult fully on our proposals.”

As well as a series of videos highlighting the variety of people helped by the act, Amnesty commissioned a poll showing around two-thirds of people did not realise it had played a role in the new Hillsborough inquest or in the Good Friday peace process in Northern Ireland.

Kate Allen, UK director for Amnesty International, said the findings were understandable given the “misreporting and myth-making” about the act.

She said: “It’s no surprise that after they’ve been force-fed a diet of distortion, relatively few people know about the role the Human Rights Act has played in helping ordinary people up and down the country win historic legal battles.”

Child trafficking victims and unaccompanied children are going missing from local authority care at an “alarming” rate according to a new report, which reveals that in one year, nearly 30% of all UK child trafficking victims and 13% of unaccompanied children disappeared from care services.

New research by child trafficking NGO Ecpat UK and the charity Missing People has found that 167 of the 590 children suspected or identified as child trafficking victims in the year from September 2014 to 2015 vanished from foster and care homes across the country.

An additional 593 of the 4,744 unaccompanied children placed under the protection of local authorities also went missing at least once in the same time period. Of the 760 trafficked or unaccompanied children who disappeared from care, 207 have never been found.

The new data, drawn largely from freedom of information requests to 217 local authorities across the UK, shows that Thurrock, Hillingdon, Croydon, Kent County Council and Surrey had the highest numbers of trafficked and unaccompanied children who were unaccounted for. One local authority reported that 22 child trafficking victims had gone missing in the recorded time period.

The majority of child trafficking victims who vanished from care are from Vietnam, Albania and the UK. Most of the unaccompanied children who went missing are from Afghanistan, Eritrea, Albania and Vietnam.

Despite the high numbers, Ecpat says that the real scale of the UK’s missing child trafficking victims is still not accurately reflected in the data.

Chloe Setter, Ecpat UK’s head of advocacy and policy, said there was “huge concern” that only 45 of the 217 local authorities asked for information were able or willing to provide data on the numbers of children whose whereabouts were still unknown.

“I think what is most alarming about this survey isn’t the data we’ve received, it is the data that we haven’t,” said Setter.

“Twenty per cent of the local authorities we contacted could not even report how many children in their care were [formally] identified or suspected of being trafficked. Only 10 local authorities could report the nationalities of the trafficked children who had disappeared. It is unacceptable that we can’t get a clear picture on how many exploited children are simply falling off the radar and, in the case of trafficked children, presumed to be back in the hands of their exploiters. These are hundreds of children who have simply vanished from places where they should have been protected.”

The report also underscores issues with identification and recording practices. Despite London being a prime destination for human traffickers, 10 of 33 local authorities reported zero trafficked children, and an additional four local authorities were unable to provide any information.

“There has to be an improved data recording system put in place for trafficked and missing children,” said Setter. “Many of the authorities we asked couldn’t even search for these children in their existing databases.”

The report cites various reasons for the children going missing, from the failure of the government to identify trafficked children, to the influence and control of traffickers, lack of trust in adults and lack of consistent support. Poor protection measures, as well as asylum and immigration concerns, were also noted.

Ecpat and Missing Children say that in order to stem the flow of exploited children disappearing from care services, the child protection system must be expanded to introduce specific training on child trafficking and unaccompanied children and investment in appropriate accommodation and support services.



Lynne Chitty, UK care director at the anti-trafficking charity Love146, said she was not surprised by the findings of the report and expected the numbers to continue to rise if urgent safeguarding policies were not implemented immediately.



“Every week we see children going missing, most within 24 hours of arriving in care, and we know child trafficking victims are largely going back to their traffickers,” she said. “Many are in debt bondage or have been given a number to call as soon as they get taken into care. They aren’t getting the protection, services or support they need to stop them from believing that their traffickers are the only option for them here.”

A spokesperson for the Department for Education said: “It is vital that children in care are protected from harm. We have already strengthened regulations on children’s homes, and local authorities have a duty to tell us about all incidents of young people going missing.

“But we know trafficked and unaccompanied asylum-seeking children are especially vulnerable. That’s why we have commissioned specialist training for those caring for them, committed to an independent advocate in each area to help champion their rights and outlined clear plans for a new government strategy to look at their particular needs, including reviewing the accommodation available.”

We are delighted to see the that committee stage of the cultural property (armed conflict) bill takes place on 15 November in the House of Commons after its all-party-supported, steady progress through the House of Lords. This legislation will enable the UK to ratify the 1954 Hague convention on the protection of cultural property in the event of armed conflict and its two protocols, making the UK the only member of the UN’s permanent five to have ratified all parts of the convention and one of the leading international players regarding the protection of cultural property during war.

However, we have the opportunity to become the leading international player. The UK government currently faces a similar opportunity to that confronted by the Swiss in the 1860s: to help an embryonic international organisation become established. The International Blue Shield, frequently referred to as the “cultural equivalent of the Red Cross”, was set up by the international community in 1996 – but without funding. Through the UK’s newly created cultural protection fund (CPF) we could, and must, support a small Blue Shield team in London to not only help its 25 existing voluntary national committees and the plethora of diverse activity currently taking place regarding the protection of the cultural heritage of the Middle East, but to act as a centre of excellence and support for those trying to protect heritage during conflict anywhere in the world.

The CPF provides the means by which we can grasp this opportunity; we urge the government to seize it.

I suspect China saw the appointment of Meng Hongwei as president of Interpol’s executive committee as a PR victory – evidence of China’s growing influence on the international stage. Thankfully, the occasion was used as an opportunity to highlight the country’s appalling rights record (New Interpol head is Chinese former deputy head of paramilitary police force, 11 November). China is one of many countries that have misused Interpol to pursue dissidents across the globe. It is wrong, however, to suggest that Hongwei’s appointment will allow China to do this more often and more easily. These decisions, with enormous implications for the people they affect, are made by Interpol’s secretariat, headed by Jurgen Stock (the real leader of Interpol’s operations).

Under Stock, Interpol has started the long-overdue task of creating safeguards against the kinds of abuse suffered by Uighur activists pursued by China. Last week, Stock announced further much-needed reforms to maintain “the confidence and trust of national law enforcement and wider society in Interpol”. The detail of these reforms haven’t yet been published so it’s hard to predict whether they will be effective in weeding out abusive cases. Ultimately, Interpol should be judged by whether it continues to allow its systems to be used as a tool of persecution. If it fails to rise to this challenge, it will not only remain complicit in human rights abuse; but will also fail to meet the “highest legal standards” that its outgoing president last week recognised as crucial to its “credibility, legitimacy and effectiveness”.

The home secretary, Amber Rudd, has signed an order for the extradition of a British man to the US, where his lawyers believe he could face up to 99 years in prison if convicted of hacking charges. Lauri Love is accused of stealing large amounts of data from US government agencies such as the Federal Reserve, the army, the Department of Defense, Nasa and the FBI in a spate of online attacks in 2012 and 2013.

The 31-year-old activist, who has Asperger syndrome, lost his legal challenge to avoid extradition in September, and on Monday the Home Office said the necessary order allowing his removal had been signed after Rudd “carefully considered all relevant matters”.

The Home Office said Love “has been charged with various computer hacking offences which included targeting US military and federal government agencies”. He has 14 days to appeal against the order and is expected to do so. 



Love, who also has depression and eczema, had argued that his health means a jail term in the US could drive him towards a mental breakdown or suicide. However, the district judge, Nina Tempia, said in her ruling on 16 September that Love could be cared for by “medical facilities in the United States prison estate”.

She said he faced “extremely serious charges” and, while she accepted that he suffered from “both physical and mental health issues”, she believed provision for his condition was adequate in the US.

US authorities have been fighting for Love to face trial there. He could face proceedings in three different US jurisdictions. Rudd had been given a deadline of 16 November to decide whether or not to order his extradition.

It is alleged that between October 2012 and October 2013, Love placed hidden “shells” or “backdoors” within networks, allowing for confidential data to be stolen. He is accused of causing millions of dollars’ worth of damage.



The Courage Foundation, which has supported Love in his legal fight, compared his case to that of Gary McKinnon, whose extradition was blocked by the then home secretary Theresa May in 2012.

Sarah Harrison, the foundation’s acting director, said: “I am dismayed to hear that Lauri Love’s extradition request has been approved, as this puts him directly in harm’s way and fails to protect his human rights. The home secretary’s decision upholds a one-sided extradition treaty that leaves UK citizens without proper protections against the threat of US prosecution.

“The US has ruthlessly persecuted hackers and digital activists for years, and nobody expects that to improve under President Trump. Theresa May set a good example by protecting Gary McKinnon back in 2012. For a home secretary in her government now to willingly send a brilliant and vulnerable UK citizen to Donald Trump’s America beggars belief.”

In a letter to the Home Office opposing extradition because of the risk of suicide, Love’s solicitor, Karen Todner, wrote this month: “One hundred and fourteen MPs have written to President Obama inviting him to recognise the seriousness of Mr Love’s mental illness and withdraw the request for extradition to permit prosecution to proceed in England, where Mr Love would be able to stand trial on bail with the support of his close family and support network.



“We … urge you to recognise that this is a case where the risk to Mr Love’s life arising from extradition is so great that it would be entirely justified for you to make your own representations to your US counterpart to withdraw the extradition request because a domestic prosecution in England would permit justice to be done and remove the severe risk to Mr Love’s life.”

Love’s father, Alexander, said in response to Rudd’s decision: “It was going to happen – it was inevitable – but it’s still painful. I cannot begin to express how much sorrow it causes me. All we are asking for is British justice for a British citizen.”

Barry Sheerman, one of more than 100 MPs who signed a letter calling on Barack Obama to block Love’s extradition, said he was “deeply disappointed”.

“We are still keeping up the pressure. We are getting more and more MPs to sign the letter to President Obama,” the Labour MP for Huddersfield said. “The pressure continues. We won’t give up.”

For American progressives, something far greater than the presidency was lost last week. Thanks to unprecedented and indeed unprincipled obstruction by Senate Republicans, Donald Trump will enter the White House with a supreme court vacancy to fill. Having failed to win control of the Senate, and with Republicans there promising to do away with the filibuster rule for supreme court nominations, it is now president-elect Trump’s prerogative to fill the high court seat that has sat empty for almost nine months, with any jurist he wishes, and to fill myriad judicial vacancies in the lower courts – some of which have remained empty for lengthy stretches, also due to GOP obstruction.

In the near term, replacing Antonin Scalia with another rock-ribbed conservative – if Trump’s list of 21 possible nominees are any indication – simply means that America returns to a 5-4 court dominated by conservatives, with Anthony Kennedy occasionally (but with increasing frequency) defecting to vote with the liberals. In the longer term, with Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg at 83, Anthony Kennedy 80 and Stephen Breyer at 78, Trump may have an opportunity to swing the high court to the hard right for decades. He has said that Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito are his model jurists. A few more such nominations in place of a Ginsburg or Kennedy will spell the end of the Warren court revolution, from the demise of Roe v Wade, to the slow erosion of racial and gender protections and environmental regulations.

In the coming months and years, even a 5-4 supreme court dominated by conservatives can launch that project in very concrete ways, including two cases in which it tied 4-4 last year: one on President Obama’s immigration executive order, and another which will decide the future funding for all public sector unions. In both cases, plus a case already on the court’s docket regarding an Obama administration regulation on bathrooms for transgender students, it can be assumed that the court will tack right again, perhaps even as soon as this spring.

A 5-4 court will also put its stamp of approval on another major legal project that involves dismantling civil rights laws in the name of the religious liberty of objectors. That started with the supreme court’s 2014 Hobby Lobby decision – allowing the religious owners of for-profit corporations to deny coverage for contraception to their secular workers, even when those workers had a statutory entitlement to it. A follow-on to that case from last term, in which religious non-profits – schools and hospitals – sought to similarly deny their workers such contraception, was sent back to the lower courts without guidance by an 8-0 court. You can be certain that when it returns to the supreme court, the objecting employees will be told to find their birth control elsewhere. In any event, it won’t matter much in these cases if President-elect Trump makes good on his promise to repeal the Affordable Care Act on his first day in office.

But last spring, at the end of the term, the court refused to hear a case from pharmacists who have religious objections to even stocking birth control. The dissenting justices were furious that the court declined to hear the case, contending that this was discrimination on the basis of religion. In the coming years, even without another supreme court seat to fill, watch for religious liberty claims from those who object to marriage equality, abortion, birth control, and other protections for women and LGBTQ Americans, fall prey to these kinds of religious freedom challenges.

And you can also expect the reconstituted 5-4 supreme court to take a wrecking ball to President Obama’s environmental protections, just as President-elect Trump promises to reverse any executive actions on that front and withdraw from international agreements. It will also continue John Roberts’ project of dismantling voter protections for minority, young and older voters, ensuring that future elections will proceed on the premise that white Americans have a right to vote and minorities must continue to fight to do so.

Certainly it is possible that Justices Ginsburg and Breyer will live for 10 more years, and you can be certain that they are both taking their vitamins after last Tuesday. It is possible, but highly unlikely, that Democrats take the Senate in 2018, making it possible for Democrats to obstruct future Trump nominees. That looks highly unlikely right now, which means that if Trump has even a single appointment in the next four years, everything from Roe to worker protections to controls over policing and the death penalty will be back in the crosshairs.

None of this begins to match the importance of four years of Trump judges in the lower federal courts and the federal appeals courts, an area in which President Obama has had a massive impact in recent years, even if it went largely unnoticed by the press and the electorate. Obama has tilted most of the federal appeals court to the left in his eight-year term, and those appointees serve for life. But Obama has also seen 20 of his district court nominees filibustered during his time in office, whereas that had only happened three times in previous administrations. And as a result of Republican obstruction of Obama’s judicial nominations in the Senate, 35 lower courts are sufficiently shorthanded as to be designated “judicial emergencies”. That is up from 12 when Obama took office.

In other words, Trump will benefit not only from a Senate controlled by Republicans, but from the eight years of prior Senate obstruction that held up Obama nominees – perfectly qualified and usually moderate – leaving the lower courts and the supreme court short-staffed. In other words, Senate Republicans not only control the playing field, they spent their time in the Senate benching Obama players.

President-elect Trump will begin to name his judges in the coming weeks and months. If his shortlist is anything to go by they will make expanding gun rights and contracting reproductive freedoms their priority. America will live with the consequences of those decisions for decades after a Trump presidency is over.

President-elect Donald Trump sent conflicting messages about his hopes for the supreme court on Sunday, saying he will appoint justices who will send abortion rights “back to the states” but conceding he was “fine” with marriage equality “because it was already settled”.

Trump made the comments in his first broadcast interview as president-elect, with CBS’s 60 Minutes, which aired on Sunday evening.

Trump also suggested he might retain parts of Barack Obama’s healthcare reforms, and said that he intends to deport as many as 3 million undocumented migrants with criminal records.

The supreme court has had eight members since the death of conservative justice Antonin Scalia in February. Senate Republicans have refused to even consider Obama’s nominee for the seat, Merrick Garland.

The vacant seat became a central campaign issue for conservatives, and CBS host Lesley Stahl asked Trump whether he would appoint a supreme court justice who wanted to overturn Roe v Wade, the 1973 case that upheld the right to abortion.

“So look,” Trump said. “Here’s what’s going to happen. I’m going to – I’m pro-life. The judges will be pro-life.”

Pressed, he said: “Having to do with abortion – if it ever were overturned, it would go back to the states. So it would go back to the states.” That did not mean women would not be able to get an abortion, Trump said, but “they’ll perhaps have to go, they’ll have to go to another state”.

“Well, we’ll see what happens,” he added. “It’s got a long way to go, just so you understand. That has a long, long way to go.”

In March, Trump suggested that women should face “some form of punishment” for having abortions, before reversing and saying states and Congress should lead lawmaking.

Asked by Stahl whether he supported marriage equality, which was made law by the supreme court in Obergefell v Hodges in 2015, Trump suggested the case did not concern him to the degree of Roe v Wade.

“It’s irrelevant,” he said, “Because it was already settled. It’s law. It was settled in the supreme court. I mean it’s done.”

Trump’s vice-presidential pick, Indiana governor Mike Pence, has opposed same-sex marriage throughout his career, and supported so-called “conversion therapy” programs that purport to change people’s sexual orientation.

Pence also signed a religious freedom law that sought to allow people to refuse service to same-sex couples because of religious convictions.

Trump, however, said he considered the matter resolved. “These cases have gone to the supreme court,” he said. “They’ve been settled. I’m fine with that.”

He was adamant, on the other hand, about gun rights, saying he wanted to stack the supreme court with justices that would defend those rights. “Everybody’s talking about the second amendment and they’re trying to dice it up and change it, they’re going to be very pro-second amendment,” Trump said.

Gun advocates last won a major battle in the supreme court in the 2008 case District of Columbia v Heller, which ended with a 5-4 ruling written by Scalia that broadly affirmed the personal right to firearms and overturned a handgun-possession ban in Washington DC.

Trump discussed a number of another issues in the CBS interview, including the brutal nature of the election campaign.

“Sometimes you have to be rougher,” he said, discussing his behaviour and choice of words in clashes with opponent Hillary Clinton and exchanges with Barack Obama, whom he met at the White House on Thursday, and wish for conciliation now.

Asked if he was still planning to appoint a special prosecutor to look into Clinton’s use of a private email server, a threat to which he added possible jail time when he made it in the second debate last month, he said he would “think about it”.

The president-elect wanted, he said, to “focus on all of these other things that we’ve been talking about”.

Vulnerable witnesses, including children and people with learning difficulties, should not be subject to unnecessarily harsh questioning in court, according to new guidelines developed by the egal profession.



A free training programme for advocates in England and Wales who deal with serious sexual offences is being launched by the Bar Council, which represents barristers, the Law Society, which represents solicitors, the Crown Prosecution Service and other legal bodies.

The chair of the Bar Council, Chantal-Aimée Doerries QC, said: “Giving evidence can be difficult or intimidating, especially for vulnerable witnesses, and what they have to say is often vital to the outcome of the case.

“Using specific techniques for cross-examination helps vulnerable witnesses to feel more secure and means that they are more likely to give their best and most accurate evidence. That is in the interests of the witnesses themselves and the interests of justice.”

She added: “Since a ruling in 2015 there has been a clear prohibition on unnecessarily repetitive cross-examination, and in cases involving vulnerable witnesses, the length and nature of cross-examination must be agreed in advance at a hearing.

“This training programme takes us a step further by developing less intrusive questioning techniques and adapting them for children and vulnerable adults.”

Last year a court ruled that judges could limit cross-examination on the credibility of a complainant in cases where other lawyers had already covered the same ground. It related to a hearing where a woman had been cross-examined for a nearly a week about her past.

The issue was also raised after the suicide of Frances Andrade, a professional violinist, four years ago after giving evidence of sexual assault, although her despair was caused by the fear that she had not been believed by the court.

Attorneys for Donald Trump have filed a motion to delay until after the presidential inauguration a class-action fraud lawsuit involving the president-elect and his now-defunct Trump University.

In the motion filed on Saturday in San Diego federal court, Trump lawyer Daniel Petrocelli argued that the extra months would give both sides time to possibly reach a settlement.

The San Diego Union-Tribune reported that Petrocelli had asked to postpone the trial until sometime soon after the 20 January inauguration, to allow Trump to focus on the transition to the White House.

“The 69 days until inauguration are critical and all-consuming,” Petrocelli said in the filing, arguing that the president-elect should not be required to stand trial during that time.

Petrocelli had said at a hearing in San Diego on Thursday that he would request the delay, though US district judge Gonzalo Curiel, who is overseeing the lawsuit, told lawyers he was not inclined to put off the six-year-old case further and encouraged the parties to settle.

The lawsuit involves students who claim they were lured by false promises to pay up to $35,000 to learn Trump’s real estate investing “secrets” from his “hand-picked” instructors.

Trump owned 92% of Trump University and had control over all major decisions, the students’ court papers say. The president-elect denies the allegations and has argued that he relied on others to manage the business.

The motion also requests that Trump be allowed to be questioned in a videotaped deposition to be recorded before the trial.

The lawsuit alleging Trump University failed on its promise to teach success in real estate is scheduled to begin 28 November.

Curiel also tentatively rejected last week a bid by the president-elect to keep a wide range of statements from the presidential campaign, which included attacks against Curiel himself, out of the fraud trial.

Trump attacked the judge as biased against him. He claimed Curiel, who was born in Indiana but is of Mexican descent, could not be impartial because of Trump’s election campaign pledge to build a wall between the United States and Mexico.

Trump’s lawyers have argued that Curiel should bar from the trial accusations about Trump’s personal conduct including alleged sexual misconduct, his taxes and corporate bankruptcies, along with speeches and tweets.

Curiel is presiding over two cases against Trump and the university. A separate lawsuit by New York’s attorney general is pending.

A cross-party committee of MPs is expected to call for the RSPCA to stop implementing private prosecutions for animal cruelty and instead hand evidence over to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS).

The findings from the Commons environment, food and rural affairs committee report is expected to provoke outcry from other animal welfare charities when it is published on Wednesday, according to reports. The RSPCA has been accused of becoming too eager to take people to court.

MPs are also expected to recommend a ban on pet shops selling puppies to end the “factory farming” of dogs, the Sunday Times said.

In 2014 the charity removed an elderly cat from the home of Richard and Samantha Byrnes after the couple called the charity about their pet. The cat was euthanised the following day by a vet, against the family’s wishes. The RSPCA subsequently tried to prosecute its owners for animal cruelty. It later acknowledged that its intervention in taking the pet cat and treatment of the couple was “disproportionate and insensitive and fell short of the standards of compassion the public are entitled to expect of the RSPCA”.

RSPCA’s chief executive, Jeremy Cooper, apologised for the mistakes the group had made earlier this year when he took charge of the charity. Speaking to the Daily Telegraph, Cooper said the organisation was “going to be a lot less political”.

“People may have had the perception we were becoming an animal rights organisation. It is not the reality now and it won’t be in the future,” Cooper said.

However, he was later accused of giving in to animal rights activists when the RSPCA said it would continue to bring prosecutions.

The committee’s report will say the RSPCA should follow the model of its Scottish sister charity, the SSPCA, which hands evidence it has gathered to the procurator fiscal which is the equivalent of the CPS, reported the Sunday Times.

“The committee is simply saying that in order for there to be no question of prosecutions being driven by any other motive than public interest, it needs to separate those activities,” one source was cited as saying. “It thinks the only way it can separate those activities is if it hands its prosecutions to the CPS.”

Labour MPs who sit on the committee have reportedly opposed the recommendations. The ban on pet shops and other “third party” sales of puppies has been proposed to counter “factory farming” of puppies which can lead to thousands of animals being housed in poor conditions.

The source said owners could see with their own eyes the conditions in which the puppies had been reared when buying directly from breeders.

There is an ugly story of prison uncleanliness in connection with the imprisonment of suffragettes going about, which demands close inquiry. Mrs Cobden-Sanderson, finding that, though detained in solitary confinement, her cell was very much alive, naturally complained to the prison. In reply she received a pail of water and a brush, with instructions to clean the cell out herself – which she, rightly, declined to do. She explained to the authorities that if it was her duty to keep the cell clean it was not her business to clean it in the first instance; and after some delay the cell was duly cleaned by the proper attendants. A more monstrous indignity to foist upon a lady, who, after all, is a first class political misdemeanant and is only in gaol for an over zealous expression of her honest convictions, it would be difficult to imagine. It is revolting. On every ground, mental, physical and sanitary, prison cells should be kept studiously clean. Who is at the head of the Home Office? Let us talk less about foreign atrocities if so distinguished a lady as Mrs Cobden-Sanderson is treated in one of our first class prisons in so truly Russian and savage a manner.

Walter Hartman, the boy who ran away from his home in Hove, and wanted to become a highwayman, was charged at Westminster with highway robbery at Pimlico. The boy snatched a purse from a lady near Eaton Square. Mr Philip Conway, solicitor for the defendant, said he could not, of course, minimise the seriousness of the offence, but it was the direct consequence of the vile literature sold to corrupt the minds of imaginative children.

In a place whose essence is the passage of time, cell doors are the metronome. Unlocking and locking, creaking and slamming: steel doors provide the soundtrack and the structure to prison life. And when the cell door doesn’t open, when this routine is broken, a shudder of uncertainty runs through the prisoner community.

A prison lockdown is staff leaving prisoners locked behind their doors. You may shrug – after all, isn’t that the point of prison? A moment’s thought, though, suggests otherwise. Prisoners need to be unlocked to be fed. To move to work. To attend education. To see the doctor, governor, probation officer … cell doors are flung open with regularity. Without unlocking, everything stops.

You wake. You wait. Time passes by, and yet you hear no movement. Cells are not being unlocked. This is the only warning of a lockdown. And so you sit. And wait. As time passes, you may begin to worry. Will domestic visits be cancelled? Have families crossed the country to be turned away? Will mail be delivered? Will letters be sent? Lunchtime arrives. Doors must unlock: people must be fed. On a lockdown, this is done with a “controlled unlock”, a handful of prisoners at a time. Do you know how long it takes to feed hundreds of men, when only five at a time are unlocked?

A few hours locked down can provide some relief, an escape from other obligations. As the day progresses, and the prison remains silent, tensions can grow.

It may be seemingly little things, such as being short of tobacco. It may be large things, such as not being unlocked in the evening to telephone home to a partner sitting patiently by their landline.

To lockdown a prison is to increase exponentially the pressure on prisoners. And sometimes pressure must find some release. Lockdowns are dangerous, and to use them as a management tool in time of crisis only reveals desperation.

A dozen of the country’s jails now have such chronic staff shortages they are having to draft in officers from other prisons to help maintain order.

The staff shortage has forced some jails into locking prisoners in their cells for extended periods, especially at weekends. Anger at the time they were spending in their cells was cited as a major factor behind last weekend’s riot at Bedford prison. The shortages are also a significant factor in the rise in prison suicides, according to experts.

On Saturday it was confirmed that 99 people have taken their lives this year in prisons in England and Wales. “This year has seen the highest number of self-inflicted deaths in prison on record,” said Deborah Coles, director of Inquest, the charity that monitors deaths in custody. “This unacceptable death toll reflects the desperate reality of overcrowded, dehumanising and violent prison conditions and the failure of prisons to protect those in their care.”

The Prison Officers’ Association (POA) said that the National Offender Management Service, which oversees the country’s prisons, has classed 12 jails as “red sites”, meaning they do not have enough staff to operate a standard regime. A similar number are classed as “amber sites”, indicating they are also suffering acute staffing issues. The POA told the Observer it estimated around 35% of the country’s prisons were experiencing some form of staffing problem.

HMP Isis in south-east London had to introduce a restricted emergency regime in response to staff shortages three years ago. The prisons inspectorate called for the temporary arrangement to be scrapped in 2014. But a report by the inspectorate last month noted that it was still in place.

“Between 34% and 44% of prisoners were locked in their cells during the working day and some prisoners had as little as one hour a day out of cell. The two house blocks shared access to work and education facilities, meaning that at any one time only up to half of the young prisoners were doing anything useful … Another area of significant concern was the safety of prisoners.”

Concerns about safety in the country’s prisons are mounting. Last month specialist officers had to be brought in after prisoners “went on the rampage” at Lewes prison in Sussex, another red site. A “mini-riot” at HMP Exeter earlier this month saw a member of staff held hostage. In August, disturbances were reported at Birmingham jail. The following month an officer at Lincoln was reportedly taken hostage and beaten after a riot broke out.

Pentonville in London, from which two prisoners escaped last week, has also been plagued by problems. Last month, a prisoner died after being stabbed at the jail. The POA told the Observer that since then there had been a further six attacks – all carried out with weapons made from razor blades – on the same wing.

Dave Todd, national representative with the POA, said a common picture was emerging. He said: “There aren’t any staff to give prisoners any meaningful regimes, so when they get out [of their cells] they want to stay out. They may get out for an hour per day at weekends but then they’re back in their cells. You’ve got a lot of prisons that are classed as red sites – certain prisons that have got real issues haven’t got enough staff in post to deliver [a] full regime. A lot of the time they’re getting surplus staff from other jails, but even that is not enough.”

Todd warned staff were becoming burned out. More prison officers are now leaving the service than are being recruited as morale plummets. Figures just published by the Ministry of Justice show that in the past year the number of full-time prison officers has dropped by almost 600.

“Liz Truss [the justice secretary] has promised 2,500 new officers, but that’s probably what they’ve taken out in the last three years – it’s made all prisons unsafe,” Todd said. “In some prisons you are starting on £19,000 a year. No offence to Tesco, but you’d probably get a better wage working in its stores than some prisons.”

He described an increasingly violent culture within the country’s jails. “Many have gang issues. Prisoners end up in debt after using new psychoactive substances such as spice. If they don’t pay for it, the dealers will take retribution and usually that’s in physical harm. We’ve got drones dropping drugs off. We’ve got old Victorian prisons where you can get access to the prison wall from a public footpath and throw things over.”

But the source of all the problems was fundamentally a lack of staff, he suggested. “We haven’t got enough to effect a decent searching strategy. We used to search a cell once every month, but we don’t do that any more. It’s all intelligence-led now. It’s reaction rather than proaction. If you look up and down the country, where there’s a lack of staff then there’s a lack of regime and then there is violence and self-harm.”

Official figures show that there are 65 assaults a day in the country’s jails and an average of two suicides a week.

Frances Crook, chief executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform, said: “Prisons across the country are struggling to deal with a toxic mix of problems – a growing population, chronic overcrowding and deep cuts to staffing. Without enough staff to keep people safe, prisons are increasingly providing restricted regimes, under which prisoners are locked in their cells for up to 23 hours a day.

“Lockdowns mean that men who could be in education or training, learning skills to help them lead crime-free lives on release, are spending their sentences lying on their bunks. Worse, the restrictions can spark violence, self-injury and disturbances, such as the riot in Bedford prison.”

The Prison Service said: “We have announced a major shake-up of the prison system, with 2,500 extra prison officers and new security measures to tackle drones, phones and drugs and help make prisons places of safety and reform. The justice secretary has always been clear that it will take time to address these longstanding problems and we must grip the real challenges and risks that we face in the shorter term.”

John Attard, national officer with the Prison Governors’ Association, said the closure of 13 prisons under the current government had exacerbated overcrowding pressures. “For the last two years, the PGA have been saying that references to drones, phones and spice were to some degree a convenient excuse that drew attention away from the issues of staffing. The bottom line is many prisons have not got enough officers.”

Pensioners will be liable for jury service until the age of 75 from next month – a change that reflects improved life expectancy.

The rise in the upper age limit for jurors, from 70 now, will enable more people in retirement to participate in their civic duty and spread the load of the jury system.

The Ministry of Justice’s intention to increase the age limit by five years was first announced two years ago. It will now come into force on 1 December.

About 178,000 people between the ages of 18 and 70 in England and Wales do jury service each year. Another 3 million people will be added to the available pool of jurors by raising the age limit; up to 6,000 older pensioners are likely to be called to sit on a jury each year.

Anyone selected for jury service may apply to be excused if they feel incapable of carrying out their duties. This is the first change to jury ages since 1988, when it was raised from 65 to 70.

The justice minister, Sir Oliver Heald QC, said: “Trial by jury is a fundamental part of our world-leading justice system and it is important that our juries reflect today’s society. People are living longer, healthier lives, so it is right that our courts are able to benefit from the wisdom and experience that older people can offer.”

Jane Ashcroft, chief executive of older people’s charity Anchor, said: “Older people already contribute a great deal to society and represent an integral part of any local community. The knowledge and experience of older people is invaluable, and I’m pleased that more will now be able to share their wisdom by contributing to the criminal justice system.”

Sarah Rochira, Older People’s Commissioner for Wales, said: “This positive step will help to challenge negative assumptions about older people and will mean they can make an even greater contribution to society. I have no doubt that our court system will benefit greatly from the wealth of knowledge and experience they will offer.”

The failure of employers in elite professions such as law and the media to stop using unpaid interns in the face of warnings must be met with a ban on the “unfair” practice, the government’s social mobility commission will recommend this week.

The most sought-after professions have become even less representative than the most selective universities, with jobs in effect closed off to those without a network of contacts and significant financial support. Only 4% of doctors, 6% of barristers, 11% of journalists and 12% of solicitors have working-class origins, according to recent research by the London School of Economics using Labour Force Survey data. In its end-of-year report to parliament, the commission warns that Britain remains “a deeply elitist nation where the chance of getting a well-paid job in a top profession is still strongly correlated with social background”.

It adds: “It is time to treat internships as part of the formal, not informal, labour market. In our 2014 state of the nation report we said that unless we found evidence that the employers were taking action to end the unfair activity of unpaid internships, the government should bring forward legislation to ban them.

“Unfortunately, we have been able to find little such evidence. As a result, the commission believes it is high time that internships are defined in law and unpaid internships banned.

“Any work placements that last more than four weeks should be classified as internships and those doing them should receive at least the minimum wage.”

Internships ranging from a few weeks to a year or more have become a prerequisite for access to the professions, the commission will claim.

The vast majority of internships are said to be in London, where the cost of living is highest. With the average cost of renting a room in London £743 a month and a monthly travel card more than £100, an internship can cost more than £1,000 a month to fund.

“The damaging impact of unpaid internships on social mobility cannot be overstated,” the commission’s report will say. “Young people without financial support from their parents are effectively excluded due to means not merit and potentially locked out from sought-after careers entirely.”

The commission, chaired by the former Labour cabinet minister Alan Milburn, finds that people from working-class backgrounds – even high attainers – are less likely to secure such jobs because they have “less access to networks and knowledge to navigate the system than their more affluent peers”.

The proportion of those in elite occupations coming from non-professional or managerial backgrounds was only four percentage points greater (50%) in 2014 than it was in 2005.

Just over three years after graduating in 2010-11, those from the most disadvantaged backgrounds were 11% less likely to be in professional employment than those from the most advantaged.

People whose parents worked in higher managerial and professional occupations make up only 14.7% of the population, but 27.2% of them end up in those occupations. Conversely, those with parents who worked in routine or semi-routine employment form 31.7% of the population, but only 17% of those who end up in top jobs.

The commission, whose deputy chair is former Tory cabinet minister Baroness (Gillian) Shephard, welcomes new recruitment processes brought in by some employers, such as looking beyond high academic results, lowering or removing Ucas points for graduate entry and introducing “CV blind” interviews.

But it finds that the medical profession has “found it much harder to open up … to those from disadvantaged backgrounds. Others, like the Bar, risk becoming even more socially exclusive”. The report adds: “In the arts and media, the dramatic rise in unpaid internships and practice of securing work experience through contacts is closing off these careers to all but those from privileged backgrounds.”

Nearly half of the recruiters who took part in the High Fliers 2016 graduate labour market survey stated that graduates with no previous work experience would have little or no chance of receiving a job offer from their organisation.

According to the same research, 32% of new entrants are recruited by top graduate recruiters from internship programmes; in banking, it is as high as nearly 80% of the graduate intake.

Theresa May has claimed that tackling social inequalities is a priority and has criticised the current situation where: “If you’re at a state school, you’re less likely to reach the top professions than if you are educated privately.”

The new prime minister’s cabinet has the lowest proportion of ministers who went to private school in more than 70 years, with 70% state-educated.

However, the report says that evidence from some firms lays bare that real progress will only be made if leading employers radically reform recruitment practices.

The commission in partnership with the Social Mobility Foundation has launched a Social Mobility Employer Index which will benchmark firms’ efforts in areas such as recruitment, selection and progression.

The report says that the index will be run with the aim of “encouraging employers to compete to recruit, and to keep, the best and brightest candidates from lower socioeconomic backgrounds”, but denies that it is seeking to name and shame the worst performers. The final rankings will be announced in the spring.

Government lawyers are exploring the possibility of arguing in the supreme court that the article 50 process could be reversed by parliament at any time before the UK completes its exit from the European Union.

Prominent academic experts have told the Guardian they know the government’s legal team has sounded out lawyers about the potential change of tack, which some argue would lead to a victory in the case brought by Gina Miller and other campaigners.

Prof Takis Tridimas, an expert in EU law at King’s College London, said: “I know that the issue of revocation is a live issue in terms of the supreme court hearing.” He had heard that the government had commissioned research on the subject, he said.

Earlier this month, the high court ruled that the government could only invoke article 50, which begins the EU exit process, through a parliamentary vote. The case was decided on the basis that, once article 50 was triggered it was irreversible and British citizens would inevitably lose rights granted through the 1972 European Communities Act.

Royal prerogative powers – the government’s executive authority – cannot be used to repeal rights granted by parliament, the three high court judges concluded in their ruling, which was sharply criticised by several tabloid newspapers, including the Daily Mail which described the judges as “Enemies of the People”.

If the government argued that MPs could vote to revoke article 50 during the exit negotiation period, some academics say, the outcome of the government’s appeal to the supreme court would be different, because it would imply that the sovereignty of parliament had not been removed.

Dr Eirik Bjorge, a senior law lecturer at Bristol University and an expert in EU law, said: “If the government decides to – and is allowed to – argue that the article 50 notice can be revoked, then it is all but sure to win in the supreme court. In those circumstances it cannot be said that, once the trigger has been pulled, the bullet will inexorably hit the target and expunge our rights under the European Communities Act 1972.”

Tridimas is one of those who believes the article 50 process could be reversed before the UK’s exit from the EU had been completed. “My view is that it is reversible,” he said. “There’s nothing in the wording of article 50 which says that it cannot be withdrawn. The Vienna convention on the law of treaties says that they can be reversed unless they state otherwise. The point of no return is two years after notification has been given [to the EU].”

Prof Paul Craig, an Oxford University expert on both EU and constitutional law, said the triggering of article 50 should be revocable by parliament. “It is a cardinal legal principle that a party is not bound by a contract or treaty until agreement has been reached,” he has argued in a blogpost. “The consequences of not being able to revoke would be particularly severe: withdrawal would have to proceed even if invocation of article 50 triggered an economic meltdown in the country.”

However, Craig said, enabling parliament to give its approval at an early stage might have dangerous consequences for democracy later on: “There is a deeper paradox in this litigation.” 



He said the claimants, who he said would like Britain to remain in the EU, were “willing to risk everything for some parliamentary voice at the trigger stage”, but this could result in a decisive parliamentary vote to invoke article 50, which would be difficult to undo subsequently.

“The government wishes to exit the EU. It conceded the article 50 point knowing that it might then lose the immediate battle, and would therefore have to seek parliamentary approval, but was confident enough that this would be forthcoming, and that thereafter the war was won, since the triggering, once done, was irrevocable.”

The government has already submitted its initial grounds for appeal at the supreme court. The papers do not indicate any shift of emphasis so far in the way the case will be presented, although it is possible that could change before the hearing in December.

A government spokesman said: “Our position is clear: the country voted to leave the EU and we will respect the will of the British people. The government told the high court that as a matter of firm policy, once given, the article 50 notice would not be withdrawn. Because legal proceedings are under way it would not be appropriate to comment further.”

Court of appeal upholds decision to keep Oxford mother's child in care

As leader of the Liberal Democrats, I have been clear that what started with democracy in June cannot end with a stitch-up. The government is determined to prevent any scrutiny of its plans, cook up a deal between Brussels and Westminster bureaucrats and foist it upon the country – a plan that no one will have voted for.

People are clearly worried about the government’s plans. No one has an idea of even its vaguest intention. For example, will it try to keep Britain in the single market, which is crucial to our economy?

It does not matter which side of this debate you were on. Whether you voted leave or remain, you deserve the right to have a say on what happens next, and the Lib Dems will fight to give that to you.

That’s why, unless the government backs our plan to give the public a say, we will vote against triggering article 50. We want a guarantee that there will be a referendum on the deal at the end of the negotiations, when people can vote for that deal or to remain in Europe.

To those who say that our plans are undemocratic, I say: what could be more democratic than giving people a vote?

David Cameron’s government did not lay out plans for what Brexit would look like. The various leave campaigns did not set out one plan for what Brexit would look like. The leave campaign during the referendum set out plans for spending another £350m a week on the NHS, in the event of Brexit – which Theresa May has now admitted won’t happen.

May did not set out plans in her leadership campaign for what Brexit would look like. She has not been elected as prime minister on the basis of any plans at all, let alone about Brexit. The government to this day has not even given the lightest pencil-sketch of an idea of what Brexit would look like. And on top of all that, it is appealing against a high court ruling in order to stop MPs having any scrutiny on the direction Brexit takes – whatever that may be.

Since nobody has set out what Brexit would look like, and nobody – neither MPs nor the public – has had a say on what should come next, how is it undemocratic to demand that people should be given a say? Those who want to railroad through a plan without guaranteeing the people a say are the ones pursuing an undemocratic path.

The referendum starkly divided our country – 52% of people voted to leave, 48% to remain. We all must have a say on our next step.

This Conservative-Brexit government seems to have set off along a path that could lead to “hard Brexit”, which would cost Britain dearly. That is why Lib Dems will also seek to amend the government’s plans to ensure membership of the single market becomes part of its negotiation plans.

The single market is a British invention that creates the framework in which tariff-free trade is conducted, and is crucial for jobs, investment and planning.

I believe the government cannot come back with a Brexit deal that is better than our membership. That is why my party campaigned for a remain vote. But when that deal is done, whatever it looks like, it should be put to a referendum.

Too much of Cameron’s handling of this issue was trying to unite a divided Conservative party. It is now critical that the government puts aside narrow party interest.

For these reasons, the only circumstances in which the Lib Dems could vote for article 50 is if any such vote includes an explicit guarantee to put the direction of Brexit back into the hands of the people through a referendum on the deal. We trusted people to vote for departure. Now we must also trust people to vote for a destination.

Privacy activists, human rights campaigners and former US security officials have expressed fears over the prospect of Donald Trump controlling the vast global US and UK surveillance network.

They criticised Barack Obama’s administration for being too complacent after the 2013 revelations by the NSA whistleblower, Edward Snowden, and making only modest concessions to privacy concerns rather than carrying out major legislative changes.

The concern comes after Snowden dismissed fears for his safety if Trump, who called him “a spy who has caused great damage in the US”, was to strike a deal with Vladimir Putin to have him extradited.

Snowden, in a video link-up from Moscow with a Netherlands-based tech company on Thursday, said it would be “crazy to dismiss” the prospect of Trump doing a deal but if personal safety was a major concern for him, he would not have leaked the top-secret documents in the first place.

Snowden, wanted by the US on charges under the Espionage Act, found asylum in Russia in 2013 but his visa is due to expire in July. 



Privacy and human rights campaigners in the US and UK say a Trump presidency will tip the balance between surveillance and privacy decisively towards the former. The UK surveillance agency GCHQ is so tied up with America’s NSA, often doing work on its behalf, it could find itself facing a series of ethical dilemmas.

On the campaign trail, Trump made an ambiguous remark about wishing he had access to surveillance powers.

“I wish I had that power,” he said while talking about the hack of Democratic National Committee emails. “Man, that would be power.”

Although Obama’s administration introduced a few modest concessions to the privacy lobby following Snowden’s revelations, he left the rest of the surveillance apparatus untouched. His approach has been to offer a modicum of transparency, much of it forced on him by the courts, in place of reform.

The White House, which would not comment for this story, has no evident regrets about that approach. The administration believes it has set an appropriate balance between intelligence authorities and civil liberties, and expressed confidence in intelligence professionals who will continue to serve in the NSA and FBI under Trump to act responsibly.

But others are less convinced. “There have been some people who were complacent about things like drone killing of US civilians and mass surveillance under Obama, because they trusted him. That wilful neglect on their part is about to come back and possibly bite all of us in the ass,” said Nick Merrill, the executive director of the Calyx Institute, a technology focused research group that promotes encryption tools.

Ben Wizner, Snowden’s lawyer who works for the American Civil Liberties Union, said: “The danger of the aggregation of executive power we have seen over the last decade is that we might have an executive who is not worthy of that trust. This has been a trend in the US but there has been a weakening of constitutional oversight during the growth of the national security state.

“I think many Americans are waking up to the fact we have created a presidency that is too powerful.”

John Napier Tye, a former state department official who became a reluctant whistleblower in 2014, warning of NSA dragnets, said: “Obama and Bush could have set the best possible privacy protections in place, but the trouble is, it’s all set by executive order, not statute.

“So Trump could revise the executive order as he pleases. And since it’s all done in secret, unless you have someone willing to break the law to tell you that it happened, it’s not clear the public will ever learn it did. Consider that even now, the American people still do not know how much data on US persons the NSA actually collects.”

Thomas Drake, an NSA whistleblower who predated Snowden, offered an equally bleak assessment. He said: “The electronic infrastructure is fully in place – and ex post facto legalised by Congress and executive orders – and ripe for further abuse under an autocratic, power-obsessed president. History is just not kind here. Trump leans quite autocratic. The temptations to use secret NSA surveillance powers, some still not fully revealed, will present themselves to him as sirens.”

One specific surveillance measure Trump proposed on the campaign trail was surveilling mosques and keeping a database of Muslims. “A grave concern we have is that his rhetoric is going to be perceived in some corners as a green light for unfettered surveillance activities. Our concern is not just about the NSA but also the FBI. The FBI doesn’t exactly have a great record over the last 15 years,” said Farhana Khera, the president and executive director of the US-based civil rights group Muslim Advocates.

The next flashpoint over the NSA’s powers will come late in 2017, when a major surveillance law permitting collection of Americans’ international communications is set for expiration, the legal basis for the NSA’s Prism programme which siphons information from the technology giants.

The UK government has made even fewer concessions to privacy campaigners than the US. The UK parliament has passed the investigatory powers bill, due to receive royal assent shortly, that basically legalises the illegal activities exposed by Snowden.

Even in Germany, where public support for Snowden is at its highest, parliament last month approved legislation that ostensibly increases oversight of intelligence agencies but which privacy campaigners claim expands their powers.

Jim Killock, executive director of the UK-based Open Rights Group, said the NSA and GCHQ worked closely together. “Given that the agencies’ operations are nearly indistinguishable, it makes it incredibly hard for the UK to resist using our resources for risky endeavours or even human rights abuses … Trump’s election ought to remove the complacency MPs have been suffering from.”

Carly Nyst, a UK-based human rights lawyer, said: “The British people should be especially worried: the NSA and GCHQ act so closely, and intelligence is shared so fulsomely, that any increase in surveillance under Trump will undeniably touch upon the privacy of Britons’ communications.”

According to documents released by Snowden, now years out of date as technological advancements have developed, the NSA vacuums 5bn daily records just of cellphone locations. In April 2011, it was collecting an average of 194m text messages every day.

Through its partnership with Britain’s GCHQ, it has access to, among other things, webcam imagery, including pornographic material. GCHQ collected such imagery from 1.8 million Yahoo users in a six-month period in 2008.

Gina Miller invites us to conduct the interview at her private members’ club in Mayfair. On arrival, as I register the heart-stopping opulence of the Georgian townhouse – where our bar bill for two small glasses of wine will come to £40, and the scented air smells too expensive to breathe – I think this is exactly what angry working-class Brexiters picture when they imagine the lives of London’s elite.



When Miller greets us, the concierge blanches at the camera equipment and says we can’t take pictures, so I suggest we relocate to a nearby hotel. “Its lounge is a bit deathly,” I say, “but it will do.” Miller’s smile freezes. “Ah. I’m afraid not. ‘Deathly’ is the word, you see. It isn’t safe for me to go outside.”

The online abuse and threats to her life began within minutes of last week’s high court ruling. Miller had taken the government to court and won; to trigger article 50 without parliament’s consent was, the judges agreed, unlawful. She didn’t take the death threats seriously at first. “It sounds awful, but they’re kind of normal nowadays, aren’t they?” Following her appearance opposite Nigel Farage show on last Sunday’s The Andrew Marr show, however, they began targeting her family and children, and Miller went to the police.

“It felt surreal. I thought: I did a court case about preserving the rule of law and the British constitution, and now on a Sunday afternoon I’m walking into a police station.”

She left her husband and children outside in the car, thinking it would take a few minutes. “And the next moment, CID are telling me to send them home because I’d be there for hours. They are taking it very, very seriously.”

She asks me not to disclose the full range of extraordinary security measures CID have imposed, several of which I had never heard of before, and she has been told to avoid all public places, even the tube.

With her office and staff bombarded by abusive calls and hate mail, Miller is having to run her life and her business from her club, less a VIP sanctuary for her than gilded prison. “We knew it would be bad. But nothing like this, obviously.”

In the past nine days, Miller has been attacked in the press as a “foreign-born immigrant” trying to “subvert” British democracy, and the three judges who ruled in her favour denounced as “enemies of the people”. Farage has called for pro-Brexit protesters to march on the supreme court in December when it hears the government’s appeal, and warned of anger “we have never seen in this country in our lifetime” and civil disorder if the ruling is upheld.

But when I ask if any bit of Miller was tempted to jump on a plane and go into hiding, she laughs at me in amazement. “Why? I’m absolutely stoic about this. It’s bullying of the worst degree, and I’m not going to let them win. This is not the society we have to live in. If anything, all this has proved, more than anything, is that I have to do this.”

She is disgusted with Liz Truss, the lord chancellor, for allowing judges “to be denigrated in this way by the press” and for releasing a mealy mouthed written statement only belatedly. “That is so shameful. She should have gone personally to a camera and said something straight away. I think it’s absolutely disgraceful that she did not defend the judiciary.”

Far from hiding from the press, Miller is determined to keep talking. “So many red lines have been crossed that people seem to think it is acceptable for politicians and the media to actually incite hatred and violence. Where in the press do you ever see ‘foreign-born Boris Johnson?’ It’s just fuelling all the nastiness, and it is disgraceful.”

Yet until last week’s ruling, the journalists Miller had approached had paid almost no attention to her case, “and didn’t really understand what I was talking about”.

The story began four days after the referendum, when the investment expert gave a talk on diversity in the City, organised by the law firm Mishcon de Reya. She got chatting to a partner afterwards, and discovered he shared her view that constitutional law did not allow the prime minister to remove British citizens’ rights by royal prerogative, without parliamentary consent.

Two other parties were also interested, instructing the firm to make a legal challenge, but ultimately were “too frightened for themselves and their families to put their heads above the parapet”. When both dropped out, “My question to Mishcon was: If I don’t do this, who will? And they said, ‘Either you do this, or it doesn’t get done.’”

Miller studied law at university, but spent her career in business and finance. “So I actually spent my summer reading case law.” She read Sir Edward Coke’s 1610 Case of Proclamations in the original. ”That’s how sad I am,” she says with a smile. “I’m afraid I’m a complete workaholic perfectionist. It’s how I operate in business in the City. I have to know more than everyone else in the room. In a roomful of men, I have to know more than them.”

Both the Referendum Act and article 50, she discovered, “are actually very poorly drafted pieces of legislation. Had the act made the referendum binding, not advisory – and they had that option, of course they did – all of this could have been prevented. But I think nobody ever thought they would lose the referendum. And article 50 was badly drafted by lawyers who thought it would never be used either.”

So watertight was her case, Miller was “quite surprised it went to court at all”. She thinks the government only fought it, and then appealed, in order to buy time. “The appeal is unwinnable, it’s just ludicrous. It is unappealable.”

In addition to two other individuals who have joined the case as interested parties, the Scottish and Welsh governments have signed up, and Northern Ireland and Gibraltar are expected to follow suit. They will argue that article 50 also requires the devolved parliaments’ consent, but Miller has her doubts about that. “We haven’t seen any legal arguments yet, but it doesn’t make sense to me. It’s still the mother of parliaments who make the decision, so I’m a little baffled by that.” She campaigned for remain, but wants to be very clear that her motivation is not political but legal.

Isn’t it her intention to block Brexit? “No. I just want MPs to do their job.” If they vote to block it, would that be democratically legitimate? “I find that question so baffling, because we have a representative democracy. People keep asking me what I think of direct democracies, but that’s a different discussion. That is not what we have now in Britain. MPs are paid to be representatives of their constituents. They have to do that job. They need to find out what their constituents want. They have to put their own egos and ambitions and interests and power struggles to one side. They have to. And if they get a resounding ‘No, we want to leave’, well then they have to do that as well.”

What if parliament votes for a second referendum before triggering article 50? “I’m not a politician, it’s up to whatever they decide. My argument is simply that it is not legal for the government to use the royal prerogative. Once we’ve asserted that, it’s up to the politicians.”

Like many people, I had been both impressed and slightly bewildered by Miller’s intervention in the politics of Brexit. How and why had a 51-year-old businesswoman dedicated her time and money to an obscure point of constitutional law? But she finds such puzzlement equally peculiar, and says it isn’t shared by anyone who knows her. A friend told her recently, “Gina, the problem with you is you’ve always been a bloody modern day suffragette.” She laughs. “The word they tend to use is ‘incorrigible’.”

Miller was born in what was then still British Guyana, the daughter of a lawyer and politician who served as attorney general. “He was a fighter for social justice. He was my inspiration, he’s instilled everything I believe in.”

When she was 10, political unrest persuaded her parents to send her to England. They considered the heavily traditional Roedean boarding school near Brighton, “But it looked like Colditz prison, and I absolutely refused”, so instead she enrolled in an “eclectic” day and boarding school in Eastbourne called Moira House, nicknamed Moron House “because it produced some very strange girls. We were all very single-minded.”

So single-minded was Miller, in fact, that at 12 or 13 she’d had enough of boarding, and with her 15-year-old brother moved into a flat in Eastbourne alone. Guyana was by then “on lockdown” and her parents were unable to get funds out of the country, so Miller dressed up in high heels from a charity shop to make herself look older, and got a part-time job as a chambermaid.

In the press she is described as a “former model”, but rolls her eyes at this. “The inaccuracies are just unbelievable. I did some work as a model at university because I needed to make money. I held down three jobs at university, leafleting outside Pizza Express – whatever it was I would I do.”

Her first marriage broke down while she was still a student, leaving her a single mother of a young daughter with learning disabilities in a one-bedroom flat. “And I remember vividly, I’d have a loaf of bread and baked beans to live on for a week. I know what it means not to have any money.”

Miller wanted to be a criminal barrister, but was put off by the discrimination against women at the bar, and set up various marketing companies before gravitating towards investment management. After a difficult second marriage, in 2006 she married Alan Miller, then a hedge fund manager, with whom she has a son and daughter.

The family live in a £7m Chelsea townhouse, so my eyebrows go up when she attributes the public anger fuelling Brexit to inequality created by the financial crash. “I absolutely understand why people are so angry. The divide is getting worse because businesses have not operated as they should. A lot of the people having stones thrown at them deserve it, because they have been irresponsible with their success. They pretended to put things right after the crash, and they didn’t.”

But look around us, I say, at this room full of sumptuous City affluence. If people are right to be furious with the monied elite, isn’t she part of the problem? “No, I’ve worked for everything I’ve got, and I class myself as a conscious capitalist. Every business should have a triple bottom line – profit, people and the planet.”

Her husband gave up hedge fund management 10 years ago when the couple set up the philanthropic True and Fair Foundation, and she campaigns against mis-selling and hidden fees in the investment industry, and the boardroom bonus culture.

“I’m absolutely hated for it in the City, because my view is there should be no bonus culture at all. Ten years ago, no FTSE CEO walked away with million pound bonus packages. Now it’s normal. No, I’m sorry, you get paid to do a job. Why do you then need another bonus package on top of it? The majority have not thought about what they are doing to people. They are just a disgrace.”

I cease to find it at all surprising that the most powerful response to the referendum result has come from Miller when she tells an anecdote about queuing for a flight and seeing a stressed mum with three screaming young children slap one of them round the face. “And I felt so awful, so I went over and said: ‘Can I help?’ And she just screamed and shouted at me. My husband said to me, ‘You shouldn’t do that, she might hit you too.’ But I said: ‘That’s all right,’ and so I persevered, and said: ‘Are you okay?’ And she really wasn’t coping. She was waving her arms about, and giving a bit of racial abuse – but that’s just the easiest thing to do when you feel like that. So I just walked up to her and hugged her.”

I cannot remember meeting a more impressive woman. She has always voted Labour, and I wish she would go into politics. It says something about the state of our political culture that the suggestion appals her. “Oh no, no, no. I think our political system is pretty broken.”

Evan Spitler thought she had no choice but to drop out of school. After she was sexually assaulted in the spring of 2015, she said, she “shut down physically and emotionally and mentally” and could not keep up with academics.

Staff at the Western Washington University, a public college in Washington state, eventually helped her get extensions on exams and offered other support services that made it a little easier to get through the semester. The school was required to assist her under Title IX, the federal anti-discrimination law that Barack Obama has aggressively used to push universities to better protect students from sexual violence and aid victims who come forward.

But activists and survivors fear that under the administration of President-elect Donald Trump, most basic rights and protections for campus victims could disappear and the Republican party could undo the substantial progress that the Department of Education’s office of civil rights (OCR) has made in holding colleges accountable.

“The resources are already so small,” said Spitler, a 22-year-old creative writing student. “If you take them away, it’s just going to silence people.”

Title IX enforcement is one of many policy uncertainties causing anxiety for progressives this week as Americans come to terms with the shocking victories of Trump and the GOP, which has gained control of Congress.

But the possibility of a major setback in the fight against campus sexual assault is particularly painful for survivors, given that Trump has boasted about groping women without their consent and that at least 24 women have accused America’s 45th president of inappropriate sexual behavior, touching, harassment and assault.

“My entire body is reeling,” said Nastia Gorodilova, a 22-year-old who became an activist after she said she was sexually assaulted during her first year of college. “It makes me feel unsafe, and it makes me feel doubted.”

Survivors’ advocates had expected Hillary Clinton to carry on the legacy of Obama and Vice-President Joe Biden, who made ending sexual violence a top priority.

Trump’s plans for Title IX are unknown, but activists expect that a GOP White House and Congress could work to reverse Obama’s policies.

In 2011, the US education department issued a guidance letter warning universities that under Title IX, they are required to have processes and staff to respond to sexual misconduct and that a failure to comply could jeopardize funding. For the first time, the administration also formally outlined victims’ rights on campus.

The guidelines were critical given that previously, the 1972 legislation had generally been used to fight gender discrimination in sports. And because rape victims face huge hurdles when reporting to police and trying a case in criminal court, Title IX provided a new avenue to seek justice.

“It was monumental for us,” said Kamilah Willingham, an activist whose Harvard sexual assault story was featured in a documentary, The Hunting Ground. “It gave us so many changes that have really been vital to the movement.”

In 2014, the federal government again issued new Title IX guidelines and took the unprecedented step of releasing the names of 55 colleges – including Harvard and Princeton – facing investigations over their handling of sex abuse complaints.

The office of civil rights currently has more than 200 open Title IX cases of sex discrimination.

Although Obama’s guidelines aren’t “executive orders” that Trump can quickly undo, some fear the president-elect could defund the office of civil rights, scale back enforcement efforts or reinterpret the law in a way that diminishes the federal government’s authority over universities.

A Trump campaign policy adviser told Inside Higher Ed in the spring that the candidate was considering moving OCR to the US justice department’s civil rights division, which some worry could shrink or eliminate its role in campus oversight.

Additionally, Trump’s New York co-chairman previously said OCR was “self-perpetuating absolute nonsense”, and the GOP platform this year officially condemned “governmental overreach regarding Title IX”, specifically referring to protections for transgender students.

A Trump spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment on Thursday.

“Without the office for civil rights, survivors will be virtually without protections on campus,” said Dana Bolger, co-founder of advocacy group Know Your Title IX.

Critics argued that defunding the office could also have serious consequences, given that OCR is currently underresourced and struggles to process investigations in a timely fashion.

“Title IX already exists in a very superficial way on a lot of college campuses, unfortunately,” said Spitler.

Bolger, 25, who has spoken publicly about her rape while at Amherst College, noted that campus Title IX offices also help survivors and victims of other forms of discrimination access counseling, healthcare, extensions on papers and other services as they cope with trauma.

“If one in five women aren’t getting the support they need to stay in school, we are going to see women dropping out, queer and trans students taking time off school, people really struggling to get an education.”

Michele Landis Dauber, a Stanford law professor, said she doesn’t believe that Trump would have the authority to immediately reverse Obama’s Title IX efforts upon entering office. But she said she was worried about the fate of the hundreds of pending cases.

“There is a real danger that the Trump administration will not see these open investigations as a high priority,” said Dauber, who is leading the recall campaign against a judge who issued a controversial sentence in a Stanford sexual assault case.

Willingham, co-organizer of the Just Say Sorry campaign, said Obama’s guidance and the OCR investigations forced colleges to take victims seriously. Previously, she said, administrators prioritized public relations and failed to punish assailants out of fear that they might sue.

“Being able to say I lodged a federal complaint against my school, and the federal government is looking into it,” said Willingham, “there’s enormous symbolic power. You’re not just one person against your school whose voice doesn’t matter.”

Court of appeal judges have backed a decision to take a four-year-old girl into care on the grounds that her long-term emotional health and life chances were threatened by her mother’s inability to control her child’s behaviour.



The girl, known as “Child B”, was placed for adoption in August after a ruling by a judge at a private family court hearing in Oxford found that her mother was incapable of providing adequate parenting or setting boundaries.

The court of appeal heard that Child B showed extremely challenging behaviour, was at times aggressive and disrespectful towards her mother, did not trust her, failed to respond to her attempts to control her, and used inappropriate language.

Social workers had at one stage carried out a parenting assessment which recorded eight examples of “worrying behaviour” by the girl, then three, during a five-week period. In one instance she had moved around car parks in an “uncontrolled way” and had once run across a road, causing a car to brake suddenly. 



Although the mother accepted that she had failed to set boundaries and protect her daughter from emotional harm in the past, her lawyers argued that her parenting had improved and that the girl was no longer at risk of suffering significant harm in her care.

Her lawyer, Frances Judd QC, argued that a child failing to follow boundaries set by the parent was “a common or garden matter”, making a care order disproportionate.

But the court of appeal ruled that the order was justified. Lord Justice McFarlane stated in a written judgment it was essential that Child B was taken into care in order to repair the emotional harm she had suffered.

He said: “I do not accept Miss Judd’s submission that a child failing to follow boundaries set by a parent is part of the ordinary stuff of parental experience or, as she put it, a common or garden matter.

“While it is indeed the case that every parent at some time or other may fail in this regard, the present case is totally outside the norm in that, most sadly, this mother as a parent largely lacks the ability to be in tune with her children’s needs from day to day or minute to minute to the extent that she wholly fails, across the board, to establish a safe structure to regulate their behaviour.”

The court of appeal heard that the mother had suffered from domestic violence at the hands of the father of Child B, and both Child B and her elder brother Child A had been monitored by social services since 2011.

Both children had at times since then been made subject to a child protection plan, and Child A, who had been placed in foster care for six months in 2013, was placed in foster care full-time this year with the agreement of his mother.

The court heard statements from social workers and guardians made in the original hearing which described the mother’s inconsistent responses to her children’s “extremely challenging” behaviour. A social worker concluded that “the children behave when they want to and are the ones largely in control”.

The children’s guardian reported concerns about the impact on the children of their mother’s “inability to provide the children with a calm, consistent and predictable environment; to manage their behaviour and routines and to provide appropriate and consistent emotional responses to them”.

The mother retained the care of her eight-month-old baby boy from a different father, known as Child C. The original ruling accepted that C had not in his short life experienced trauma, and it was hoped that with just one child to focus on the mother would be able to give “good enough” parenting.

Donald Trump’s attorney told a federal judge on Thursday that he’s open to settlement talks in a class-action fraud lawsuit involving the president-elect and his now-defunct Trump University. 



Attorney Daniel Petrocelli also asked during a hearing that the trial be delayed until early next year because Trump needs time to work on the transition to the presidency.

The lawsuit alleging Trump University failed on its promise to teach success in real estate is currently set to begin 28 November in San Diego.

Petrocelli said he agreed to an offer by US district court judge Gonzalo Curiel to have US district judge Jeffrey Miller work with both sides on a possible settlement.

“I can tell you right now I’m all ears,” Petrocelli told Curiel.

Petrocelli said he planned to file a formal request for a delay by Monday.

Curiel didn’t say how he would rule but encouraged efforts to settle.

Petrocelli said it didn’t appear possible for Trump to attend the trial, and Curiel said he didn’t expect attendance by the president-elect.

“We’re in uncharted territory. We need a little bit of time,” Petrocelli said.

Earlier in the day Curiel, the Indiana-born jurist who was accused of bias by Trump over his Mexican heritage, tentatively denied a request to ban statements made by and about Trump during his campaign from being used at the trial.

The highly unusual petition would apply to Trump’s tweets, a video of Trump making sexually predatory comments about women, his tax history, revelations about his private charitable foundation and the public criticism of the judge.

Petrocelli told the judge last month that evidence tied to the campaign would be irrelevant to the civil case and may prejudice or inflame a jury, jeopardizing the right to a fair trial.

The lawyer warned that allowing the jury to consider Trump’s remarks “carries an immediate and irreparable danger of extreme and irremediable prejudice to defendants, confusion of issues and waste of time”.

Curiel said he was prepared to deny the request because Trump’s attorneys didn’t specify what evidence they wanted to exclude. He said he would consider specific objections at trial.

The lawsuit filed in 2010 on behalf of former customers alleges that Trump University, which was not accredited as a school, gave seminars and classes across the country that were like infomercials, pressuring people to spend up to $35,000 for mentorships and, in the end, failing on its promise to teach success in real estate.

The claims mirror another class-action complaint in San Diego and a lawsuit in New York.

Petrocelli told reporters in May that Trump planned to attend most, if not all, of the trial and would testify.

“He has very, very strong feelings about this case,” Petrocelli said at the time.

At the May hearing, Petrocelli asked for a trial after Inauguration Day on 20 January , but the judge raised concerns about distractions if Trump won the election.

The liability phase of the trial is expected to last four to six weeks. If Trump is found liable, the trial would move to a second phase on damages.

US president-elect Donald Trump heads to court later this month to face charges that he ran a scheme that “preyed upon the elderly and uneducated to separate them from their money”. It’s the first of an unprecedented slew of legal issues to face an incoming president.

On Thursday, Judge Gonzalo Curiel will hold a hearing on jury instruction and what evidence can be admitted in the class action lawsuit brought by students of the president-elect’s now defunct Trump University.

Trump attracted major criticism during the campaign from politicians on both sides when he attacked Indiana-born Curiel, calling him “a total disgrace” who “happens to be, we believe, Mexican, which is great”.

Trump later told the Wall Street Journal that Curiel was biased and had “an inherent conflict of interest” as someone with Mexican heritage because of Trump’s plans to build a wall to keep Mexicans out of the US.

The first day of the trial, at which he has been called as a witness by both sides, is set for 28 November. Daniel Petrocelli, Trump’s lawyer, has attempted to delay the trial, however Curiel seems intent on starting it before the inauguration.

The hearing is the first of an unprecedented slew of legal difficulties that the president-elect must overcome.

Trump is suing celebrity chef José Andrés for pulling out of his just-opened Washington DC hotel. Andrés, a Spanish-born immigrant, found Trump’s explicit racism so offensive that he joined Hillary Clinton’s campaign, declaring himself “a proud immigrant”. Trump sued him for $10m; Andrés countersued for $8m.



There is a mediation scheduled between Trump’s Washington hotel and Andrés on 29 November, the day after the Trump University hearing, according to a clerk at the DC district court where Trump is suing his former employee.

In solidarity with Andrés, a fellow celebrity chef, Geoffrey Zakarian, also pulled out of Trump’s DC hotel, which opened two weeks ago a stone’s throw from the White House. Trump is suing him as well, for damages “in excess of $10m”. Their mediation is scheduled for next year in the same court as the suit against Andrés.

While Trump has plenty of legal dates in his calendar already, he faces more. The New York attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, who filed another suit against Trump University in 2013, is continuing his investigations.



Schneiderman’s office is also investigating the president-elect’s namesake charity, the Donald J Trump Foundation, for alleged violations of the tax code governing nonprofit organizations.

There is also the case of Kashiya Nwanguma, a woman who is suing Trump for inciting violence at a a rally in Louisville, Kentucky. The violence was caught in a video. One of the men pushing Nwanguma is prominent white nationalist Matthew Heimbach, who is also named in the suit. The suit is waiting for western district of Kentucky judge David Hale to rule on two motions to dismiss, a clerk told the Guardian.

Trump has Bill Clinton to thank for the fact that his legal woes will follow him into the White House. In 1997, the supreme court ruled that a sitting president is not immune from litigation over actions taken before he took office. Clinton was being sued by Paula Jones, now a Trump ally, who accused Clinton of sexual harassment. Clinton became the first president to be interrogated under oath as a defendant in a civil lawsuit or before a grand jury as a possible criminal target. He settled the suit a year later.

It’s the familiar multicoloured 3D brainteaser that has challenged puzzle enthusiasts for more than 40 years and is still the world’s bestselling toy of all time.

But on Thursday – after a 10-year legal tussle – Rubik’s Cube lost a key trademark battle after the European court of justice (ECJ) said its shape was not sufficient to grant it protection from copycat versions.

The eponymous puzzle, invented in 1974 by Hungarian sculptor and architect Prof Ernő Rubik, is popular among young and old, with more than 350m cubes sold worldwide.

UK company Seven Towers, which oversees Rubik’s Cube intellectual property rights, registered the shape as a three-dimensional EU trademark with the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) in April 1999.

But the court ruled that the EU trademark representing the shape of the Rubik’s Cube was invalid. The ruling has ramifications for the game’s various licensed manufacturers, including John Adams in the UK, which could face competition from mass-produced, cheaper imitations.

In May, a judge said the shape did not qualify for trademark protection. The case was brought by the German firm Simba Toys, which had challenged the trademark protection in 2006, claiming the cube’s rotating capability should be protected by a patent, not a trademark.

The European court of justice ruled: “In examining whether registration ought to be refused on the ground that shape involved a technical solution, EUIPO and the general court should also have taken into account non-visible functional elements represented by that shape, such as its rotating capability.”

The Rubik’s Cube is made up of turning miniature cubes. It was initially known as the Magic Cube and sold from a Budapest toy shop but was renamed in 1980 and launched worldwide.

According to NPD Group, the global information company, the Rubik’s Cube becamethe third bestselling game or puzzle in the UK this year, after the Pie Face Game and Monopoly.

David Kremer, president of Rubik’s Brand in the UK, said: “We are disappointed by today’s decision by the ECJ. While the Rubik Brand is fortunate in having other trademarks, copyright, passing off and unfair competition protection to rely on which will continue to ensure its exclusivity, this judgment sets a damaging precedent for companies wishing to innovate and create strong brands and distinctive marks within the EU, and is not what European lawmakers intended when they legislated for 3D trademarks. We are baffled that the court finds functionality or a technical solution implicit in the trademark.”

Alex Brodie, a partner with international lawyers Gowling WLG, said:“Simba Toys have been successful, after 10 years of legal wrangling, in getting rid of Rubik’s 3D cube trademark. This judgment underlines the law that trademark registrations should not be used to obtain an eternal monopoly on technical solutions or functional characteristics of products – that protection is something that may be covered by other rights such as patent law – protection that has a limited life unlike trademarks. A great impact is likely to be on the toy and game industry who will be considering their portfolio of 3D trademark registrations to assess how viable those registrations are.”

The case is the latest in a series of high-profile failures to secure trademark protection for unusual and distinctive shapes.After a lengthy legal tussle, Nestlé was unable to trademark its four-finger chocolate bar KitKat in the UK, after a high court ruling in January.

The lord chancellor has said she takes her oath to defend the judiciary seriously but will not criticise the press for the reporting of the high court Brexit case, in which three judges were called “enemies of the people”.

In a letter to the Times, Liz Truss said the independent judiciary was robust enough to withstand attack by the Daily Telegraph and Daily Mail.

Last week, one of her predecessors, Lord Falconer, called for her to be sacked as justice secretary. He wrote to the Times that her failure to speak out “signals to the judges that they have lost their constitutional protector”.

“Until she is replaced by someone willing and brave enough to do the job, the judges should rightly fear for their independence,” Falconer said.

Truss has faced mounting criticism in legal circles, including from her own party, for her perceived unwillingness to oppose attacks on the judges who decided that the two-year formal process for leaving the EU could not be triggered by the government alone and required a vote from parliament.

In her reply to Falconer on Thursday, Truss denied she had failed to defend the judges. “An independent judiciary is the cornerstone of the rule of law, vital to our constitution and freedoms,” Truss wrote.

“It is my duty as lord chancellor to defend that independence. I swore to do so under my oath of office. I take that very seriously and I will always do so.

“Lord Falconer of Thoroton QC says that ‘judges should rightly fear for their independence’ due to my not condemning the reaction of some newspapers to the Brexit ruling. I think it unlikely the high court is imperilled by the opinions of any newspaper.”

Truss said the freedom of the press was also an important principle that was at stake in the debate. “I believe in a free press, where newspapers are free to publish, within the law, their views,” she said. “It is not the job of the government or lord chancellor to police headlines, and it would be a dark day for democracy if that changed.”

Truss called the three judges, including the lord chief justice, who ruled on the case “people of integrity and impartiality, as are the 11 supreme court justices who will hear the appeal”.

The trio exercised that independence and made a ruling without fear or favour, she said. “The right of the judges to make that judgment was never in question, and I defended their independence after that decision.”

Tory MPs and peers have also made their disquiet known to Truss, meeting her on Monday night to voice concern about the slowness of her response. Those at the private meeting said there was astonishment when Truss suggested the job of defending the judiciary should fall to the lord chief justice in the first instance, given that he had sat on the case and was one of those under attack for the judgment.

In the House of Lords on Tuesday, the Conservative former justice minister Edward Faulks, a past critic of Truss, called the past week’s events “a disgraceful attack on the judiciary”.

The Conservative chair of the Commons justice select committee, Bob Neill, issued a statement too, saying that a right to freedom of the press “should not be couched in terms of abuse of individuals who, by virtue of the oath they have taken and the role they discharge, cannot defend themselves publicly”.

A US judge accused of bias by Donald Trump because of his Mexican heritage is to hold a pre-trial hearing on Thursday in a class-action lawsuit over the president-elect’s now-defunct Trump University.



US district judge Gonzalo Curiel is holding the hearing to instruct the jury and examine what evidence to allow at trial, which begins on 28 November. Trump could be called to testifying before his inauguration as the 45th US president.

Among the flurry of requests from both sides is a highly unusual petition by Trump’s legal team to exclude any statements made by or about their client during the presidential campaign.

The request would apply to Trump’s tweets, a video of him making sexually predatory comments about women, his tax history, revelations about his private charitable foundation and public criticisms about Curiel.

Trump’s lawyer, Daniel Petrocelli, told the judge last month that evidence tied to the campaign would be irrelevant to the civil fraud case and may prejudice or inflame a jury, jeopardising rights to a fair trial.

He warned that allowing the jury to consider Trump’s remarks carried “an immediate and irreparable danger of extreme and irremediable prejudice to defendants, confusion of issues and waste of time”.

The lawsuit, filed in 2010 on behalf of former customers, alleges that Trump University, which was not accredited, gave seminars and classes across the country that were like infomercials, pressuring people to spend up to $35,000 for mentorships and, in the end, failing on its promise to teach success in real estate.

At the May hearing, Petrocelli asked for a trial after inauguration day on 20 January, but the judge raised concerns about distractions if Trump won the election.

The lawyer said the period between the election and swearing-in was extremely hectic for a president-elect but that it was preferable to holding a trial during the campaign.

The election of Donald Trump as the next US president will have been terrible news for the 60 detainees still unlawfully incarcerated in Guantánamo Bay. In the election campaign, Trump said that he would reverse Obama’s plan to shut Guantánamo. He has declared that he would keep it open and and fill it with “bad dudes”, even if they are US citizens.

Donald Trump has no problem with torture. Responding to a question about waterboarding, he replied “I like it a lot, I don’t think it’s tough enough … I would bring back waterboarding and I’d bring back a hell of a lot worse.”

President Obama has only a few days left to fulfil his pledge of eight years ago – to close Guantánamo and end this shameful chapter of US history. All the detainees have suffered a total denial of their human rights and years of abuse and torture. Many are old and infirm, and in need of long-term medical care. Most have been in Guantánamo since it opened nearly 15 years ago. Obama must end this gross injustice. Even President George W Bush wanted to close Guantánamo. Obama must act with urgency and let the remaining prisoners go home to their families before Donald Trump becomes the next commander-in-chief on 20 January.

Struggling, like so many others, with the overwhelming sense of despondency at Trump’s election, compounding the lingering depression of Brexit, as one tries to find some explanation for the spreading darkness of the tribal nationalism that seems to be pervading so many of the countries long viewed as the bastions of progressive society, it is too easy to offer the cloak of alienation from the “ruling class”, or even of ignorance, to those who, with their votes, are welcoming the leaders of this regression.

Undoubtedly, inequality, so accentuated in recent times, plays a significant part. However, what is common to the success of such leaders is their cynical and dangerous plumbing of the depths of the most negative facets of human nature.

The veneer of civilisation, painstakingly applied over so many years by the now seemingly distant voices of Enlightenment, ever brittle, has become fractured, allowing those who seek to do so – Trump, Farage, Johnson, Le Pen, et al – to prise open the fissures, breathing the oxygen of negativity on to the malevolence which had been so precariously contained, fuelling the hostility towards whatever factions happen to present themselves as enemies of convenience.

How vital, therefore, that we hold firmly to those tenets of true democracy, the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary. It is a sad reflection on the state of America that the supreme court has become so politicised. As our supreme court faces its sternest test of resolve, never has such independence been more crucial.

• The Brexit scenario and the saga of the 2016 US election suggest that archaic systems of so-called democracy are no longer fit for purpose in the 21st century. As unconstrained hate, xenophobia, racism and demonstrable lies have become accepted as successful political currency, the apparent result – authoritarian and nationalistic rightwing systems of government and social organisation – conjures spectres of the F-word: fascism. If this does not represent the objectives of the electorate, and is simply a result of democratic “systems error”, reprogramming of the system is urgently needed.

More women and minority ethnic lawyers will be helped to become judges, the first female lord chancellor, Liz Truss, has pledged.

A broader assessment of merit that includes “potential” rather than merely judicial experience will be developed to improve recruitment, she told a conference celebrating the first century of women in the legal profession.

“The reputation of our judiciary is unrivalled. It is crucial we make the new judiciary even more open and diverse,” she said at the conference organised by the First Hundred Years organisation. The legal profession was only opened up to women after the Sex Discrimination Act (Removal) in 1919.

“I have always said that we will select on the basis of merit,” Truss said. “The assessment of merit needs to include an assessment of potential. You shouldn’t be put off [from applying to be a judge] because you have not had [much] experience] of a courtroom. What matters should be your potential.”

She said she also wanted to see more women and minority ethnic barristers become Queen’s counsel. Only 13% of QCs are women and 6% are from minority ethnic backgrounds.

Truss said she had talked to City law firms in the so-called Magic Circle and Silver Circle about encouraging more lawyers to apply for a place on the bench.

“If should not be about how many hours you put in,” she said. “What matters is the talent.” The culture of “presenteeism” in law firms, where success is measured by the number of hours spent in the office, should be rejected.

“To force the pace of change we must tackle both the practical barriers and a mindset that can sometimes prevent talent from breaking through,” she said. “The abilities needed to be a judge are legal knowledge, integrity, intellect and drive – not how many hours you have put in on the circuit or spent in the courtroom.”

Truss said the selection process for judges would be changed. In the next competition round to appoint recorders – part-time crown court judges – the selectors would be looking for the 100 best applicants “no matter where they live”.



Deputy high court judges would be given a fast-track process to apply for full-time high court positions, she added.

“The next recruitment campaign [for the high court] will for the first time open the door to a wider pool of direct-entry candidates – individuals who, while exceptionally talented, have not had previous judicial experience. These may be academics, in-house counsel or perhaps Magic Circle solicitors who spend more time in boardrooms than courtrooms.”

Truss did not take any questions at the conference, held at the offices of the law firm Simmons and Simmons, and declined to comment on the row last week over media attacks on high court judges after the Brexit judgment.

Senate Republicans staged an unprecedented blockade of Barack Obama’s nomination to fill the US supreme court seat left vacant by the unexpected death of Justice Antonin Scalia. This gamble could have failed, allowing Hillary Clinton to nominate a younger and more liberal justice than Merrick Garland.

Instead, from their perspective, it was a huge success. Republicans will now maintain control of the court. And depending on how many nominations Donald Trump gets, very rightwing Republican justices could be in control of the supreme court for more than a generation.

The first question arising from all this is what kind of justices Donald Trump will nominate. The answer to this question is actually straightforward: pretty much the same kind of justices any Republican president would nominate. Some anti-Trump conservative intellectuals have fretted that Trump cannot be counted on to nominate conservative justices, but there’s little basis for that belief. Trump’s proposed list of judges was a standard-issue conservative wishlist, and there’s no reason to think it doesn’t reflect how Trump will act in office.

And of course, while a Republican Senate is unlikely to be a very effective check on Trump’s worst excesses, it will be an effective check on any moderation in appointments. A Republican Senate rejected George W Bush’s nomination of Harriet Miers as insufficiently reliable or qualified, and they would do the same thing in the highly unlikely event that Trump nominated a justice who doesn’t come from the Federalist Society wishlist.

The best-case scenario for Democrats, then, is that Trump gets only one nomination. Replacing Scalia will not, in itself, transform the court. Scalia was a reliable conservative, and the moderate Republican Anthony Kennedy will remain the median vote. Replacing Scalia will still have some bad immediate effects, though – the court will now almost certainly act to cripple unions, for example. But at least Roe v Wade and the federal right to same-sex marriage will remain safe.

Trump could have a much longer-term impact on the court, however. Given how favorable the Senate map is for Republicans in 2018, he will almost certainly have a window to get nominees confirmed throughout his first term. One of the court’s Democratic-appointed justices, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, is an 83-year-old survivor of pancreatic cancer. Another, Stephen Breyer, is 78. Both might be on the court in 2021, but you wouldn’t want to bet too much on it.

And, frankly, it’s hard to avoid the conclusion that they acted irresponsibly by not resigning when Barack Obama still had a Democratic Senate before the 2014 midterms. It is very possible that this decision will mean that Ginsburg’s sterling legacy of advancing gender equality and civil liberties will be undone by her decision.

A great deal could also turn on how Anthony Kennedy, the 80-year-old moderate Republican, perceives Trump. Typically, one would expect a justice in Kennedy’s position to resign and allow a president from his party to choose his successor even if he’s physically able to remain on the job. It’s possible that Kennedy is disdainful of Trump’s brand of Republicanism and doesn’t want his landmark rulings on LGBT rights overruled. Or he may, like so many Republicans have, treat Trump as a normal Republican and allow him to pick his successor.

If Trump could appoint between two and four justices, the impact would be extraordinary. A very conservative Republican bloc would control the court, possibly for decades. A woman’s constitutional right to an abortion would be extinguished. The national right to same-sex marriage would also be likely to go. The civil liberties of citizens would be severely diminished. The rights of workers will be seriously curtailed, and American business will act with fewer regulatory constraints.

The next Democratic government would face a supreme court that takes a narrow view of federal powers. And by allowing money to swamp elections and vote suppression by state legislatures, a Republican supreme court would continue to tilt the political playing field in favor of the Republican Party.

Donald Trump might be president for only four years. But even that is probably enough time to produce a supreme court that would have a huge policy impact on American politics long after he has left office.

Human rights groups have criticised a UK trade minister for travelling to Qatar to seek contracts for British companies before the 2022 World Cup without apparently highlighting the abuses faced by migrant workers building venues for the event.

Greg Hands, junior minister at the Department for International Trade, was in Qatar on Wednesday for a conference in Doha called Sport is Great, billed as an opportunity “for UK companies to meet with key decision-makers and buyers actively looking to procure services to support projects in the run-up to the 2022 Fifa World Cup”.

Amnesty International said it was “extremely disappointing” that Hands had not spoken out about human rights ahead of the visit, saying Qatar’s construction sector was “rife with abuse”.

Human Rights Watch said Hands seemed to be making an “obsequious sales pitch”, and that UK companies should beware of the risks to reputation of involvement in Qatar’s construction boom.

The awarding of the World Cup to Qatar has proved hugely controversial, particularly the treatment of the thousands of foreign workers, mainly from south Asian nations, many of whom have been put up in squalid accommodation, had their pay withheld or delayed, and their passports confiscated.

Fifa faces legal action in the Swiss courts over its alleged complicity in the mistreatment, amid calls for football’s world governing body to move the 2022 tournament away from the Gulf state.

Hands’ department said it would check whether the minister planned to raise any human rights concerns with his hosts. However, Hands did not mention them in an article published on Wednesday in the Peninsula, an English language newspaper in Qatar.



The article praised the absolute monarchy’s “ambitious sporting vision” in securing the World Cup, as well as last month’s cycling Road World Championships, and the World Athletics Championships in 2019.

“This is an exciting time for Qatar’s vision, and the UK has the opportunity to be a strategic partner to ensure all these events are as successful as possible for spectators, competitors and organisers alike,” Hands wrote, saying Britain had a “world-leading capability in delivering global sports events”.

Hands ended the article by saying he was “looking forward to touring some of the sites where nations will be pinning their hopes of World Cup victory in 2022”, adding that he took great pride in the involvement of UK companies in the endeavour.

Amnesty International UK’s head of policy and government affairs, Allan Hogarth, said: “Greg Hands’ job involves banging the drum for trade, but it’s extremely disappointing he couldn’t find room in his article to make even a passing mention of the dangerous and exploitative conditions many of the migrant labourers building Qatar’s gleaming new sports venues find themselves in.

“The stadiums, roads and other infrastructure for World Cup 2022 are being constructed by often poorly paid people from places like India and Nepal – migrant workers who routinely have their passports confiscated and regularly work excessively long hours in intolerably hot and dangerous conditions.

“Qatar’s construction sector is rife with abuse, as we and others have been highlighting for years. We’d like Mr Hands to raise this with his hosts in Doha and show he understands that the 2022 World Cup shouldn’t be based on violating the human rights of hundreds of thousands of exploited workers.”

Nicholas McGeehan, the Qatar, UAE and Bahrain researcher for Human Rights Watch, said: “It’s understandable that the UK government wants to ensure British companies get as many construction and engineering contracts as possible, but Greg Hands should be mindful of the fact that Qatar’s construction market poses serious legal and reputational risks to UK firms on account of the Qatari government’s stubborn refusal to meaningfully reform its labour system or investigate an alarming pattern of unexplained migrant worker deaths.

“The minister’s article reads like an obsequious sales pitch, but in that sense it is fairly consistent with the UK government’s approach to the Gulf states.”

Two families who claimed that the bedroom tax, which restricts housing subsidies, was unfair have won their appeals against the UK government at the supreme court.

But five other claimants had their challenges dismissed at the country’s highest court in a judgment that considered the specific circumstances of each individual applicant.

The seven-justice panel upheld the claims of Jacqueline Carmichael, who is disabled and cannot share a room with her husband, Jayson, as well as that of Paul and Susan Rutherford, who care for their severely disabled grandson, Warren, 17, in a specially adapted three-bedroom bungalow in Pembrokeshire, south Wales. Both had claimed discrimination under the European Convention on Human Rights.

Roger Toulson, who read out the main judgment, said: “Mrs Carmichael [who has spina bifida] cannot share a bedroom with her husband because of her disabilities … The Rutherfords need a regular overnight carer for their grandson, who has severe disabilities.” Subjecting them to the bedroom tax was therefore “manifestly without reason”.



The ruling pointed out that housing benefit regulations allow claimants to have an additional bedroom where children cannot share a bedroom because of a disability and that this exemption should be extended - as in the case of the Carmichaels - to adults.

The judgment follows a three-day hearing, which began on 29 February, at which lawyers representing adults with disabilities and adult carers went to the supreme court to argue two sets of cases.

The claimants, who were represented by Central England Law Centre, Leigh Day and the Child Poverty Action Group, said disabled people were being discriminated against because they were subject to regulations made for the able-bodied.

Since April 2013, housing benefit for people in the social rented sector deemed to have a spare bedroom has been reduced by 14% and people deemed to have two or more spare bedrooms have had their housing benefit reduced by 25%. In these claims the issue was over whether disability meant they could move to smaller accommodation.



Cases brought by the other families were dismissed even though the court said it had “profound sympathy” for some of the claimants who lost. There were cries of “shame” from some of them when the judgment was announced.

Paul and Susan Rutherford were in court to hear the result. “It’s been a three-and-a-half-year battle,” Paul said afterwards. “We have had to keep re-applying for benefit all the time. It hasn’t been easy. I’m relieved, happy that a lot of other people who are in the same position as us will benefit from this decision.

“Warren cannot communicate but knows that we have gone up to London. If we had lost we would have had to downsize and fit out a new property with ceiling hoists and special adaptations. If we moved to a two-bedroom place we wouldn’t have had anywhere to employ carers. Health and safety would not have allowed it.

“Our [present] bungalow was fitted out for Warren and the spare room was intended to be used by a carer so that he or she could stay overnight.”

Sophie Earnshaw of the Child Poverty Action Group, who represented the Rutherfords, said: “This is a great result. Today marks the end of a three-year ordeal for the family. This means that those with disabled children who need overnight care will not be subject to the bedroom tax. Thousands of people will no longer be affected by the bedroom tax.

“For Paul and Sue this means they will be able to move on with their lives and be able to care for Warren at home. We hope the government will repeal the bedroom tax in its entirety.”

Rosa Curling, a solicitor at the law firm Leigh Day, who represented the Carmichaels, said: “This is an extremely important and welcome decision which recognises that the government cannot trample over people’s rights in the name of austerity.

“Our clients had a very clear medical need for two bedrooms and it’s disappointing that the government chose to fight this case for three years, putting our clients through a long period of uncertainty. Our clients are delighted that justice has been done and they can now start to move on with their lives knowing that their rights as a disabled person and their right to a family life together will be respected.”

But the claim brought by a woman identified only as A, who is a victim of domestic violence, was dismissed by a majority of five to two justices on the supreme court.

Her predicament has been highlighted by campaigners concerned that women who have had their homes specially adapted because of security threats from ex-partners will be forced to move to smaller and potentially less secure homes at great cost.

Rebekah Carrier, a solicitor with the law firm Hopkin Murray Beskine, who represented A, said she would appeal to the European court of human rights. “My client has been subjected to the bedroom tax because she was allocated a three-bedroom house 25 years ago, through no choice of her own, due to a shortage of two-bedroom houses,” Carrier said. 



“She is a vulnerable single parent who has been a victim of rape and assault. Her life remains at risk and she is terrified. As a result, she has been given the protection of a multi-agency network and had her home specially adapted by the police, at great expense.” 



Brenda Hale, who was in the minority, observed in her dissenting judgment: “The state has provided Ms A with such a safe haven. It allocated her a three-bedroomed house when she did not need one. That was not her choice. It later fortified that house and put in place a detailed plan to keep her and her son safe.

“Reducing her housing benefit by reference to the number of bedrooms puts at risk her ability to stay there. Because of its special character, it will be difficult if not impossible for her to move elsewhere and that would certainly put the state to yet further expense.”

A spokesperson for the Department for Work and Pensions said: “It is welcome that the court found in our favour in five out of the seven cases. The court also agreed with our view that discretionary housing payments are generally an appropriate and lawful way to provide assistance to those who need extra help. 



“In the two specific cases where the court did not find in our favour, we will take steps to ensure we comply with the judgement in due course. In most cases, local authorities are best placed to understand the needs of their residents, which is why we will have given them over £1bn by the end of this parliament for discretionary housing payments to ensure that people in difficult situations don’t lose out.”

Among campaigners in court to hear the judgment was Paula Peters, of Disabled People Against Cuts. She said: “While we are pleased for Jayson and Paul, who had their claims upheld, we are very concerned for disabled people who are in adapted property and who need a spare bedroom. The court ruled that the decision does not cover them in specially adapted property and they would have to move to another adapted property of a smaller size, of which there is a great shortage.”

The Rev Paul Nicholson, of Taxpayers Against Poverty, said: “I have watched people lose weight because they can’t survive on cuts imposed by the bedroom tax. It’s a bad law.”

Claire Glasman, of the anti-poverty group WinVisible, said: “The bedroom tax is an attack on low income people. It only affects people in social housing. Councils have been discriminatory in how they administer housing payments.

“We are worried that women and children are going to die as a result of the ruling on women fleeing domestic violence. There’s no safety for them in this judgment. [The judges] are picking and choosing in disability cases. Why should people have to lose their homes?”

Debbie Abrahams MP, the shadow work and pensions secretary, said: “The bedroom tax is a cruel and unnecessary policy. It is widely despised by the British public, who see it what for what it is; a callous attempt to punish low-income, social housing tenants. A Labour government will scrap [it], ending the misery faced by thousands across the country.”

A police force has been criticised after it emerged it handed out cautions for serious offences including rape, child abduction and soliciting to commit murder.



The police and crime commissioner, Tony Lloyd, has demanded answers from Greater Manchester police (GMP) after it was revealed that cautions were given out for hundreds of serious crimes over the past five years.

The figures were released under freedom of information legislation and revealed that the force had handed out 14 cautions for rape offences and a further 177 for a variety of sex crimes.

A caution requires an offender to admit their crime and is regarded as an official “slap on the wrist” and an alternative to a charge that would bring the perpetrator before a court.

Lloyd said: “On the face of it, it is clearly unacceptable that cautions should be issued for serious crimes such as rape. Taking this approach without a clear, transparent and justifiable rationale risks endangering public confidence in the way in which the police deal with the most serious of offences.

“Greater Manchester police now need to explain clearly to the public how it is that rapists have ended up with a slap on the wrist, and I will demand an explanation from the chief constable Ian Hopkins this week at my monthly public scrutiny forum.”

Half the rapists were handed a “conditional caution”, where they could be required to complete a course addressing their behaviour or make reparation to their victim to go along with an official warning, which would remain on their police record.

No minimum sentence applies to rape crimes although official guidelines for judges suggest a “starting point” of five years in prison before time is added or subtracted for aggravating or mitigating factors.

The MP for Blackley and Broughton, Graham Stringer, said the use of cautions for rape and sex offences was “completely inappropriate”.

He said: “There is a place for the police caution, but for rape and sexual assault it’s simply wrong.”

An analysis of the cautions handed out for 14 rape offences shows three were given to adults, two for the rape of a girl under 16 and another two for the rape of a girl under 13.

A further 11 cautions were given to boys for rape crimes, three of them in 2015-16 for raping under-13s.

It was also revealed that many more serious crimes ended in a caution, including robbery, gross bodily harm (GBH) and wounding.

The figures, released to the Manchester Evening News, showed 86 cautions were handed out for robbery; 81 for GBH; 149 for malicious wounding; 60 for racially or religiously aggravated common assault; 60 for indecent exposure; 33 for violent disorder; 26 for aggravated vehicle taking; 22 for arson endangering life; 18 for possessing a real or imitation firearm; 18 for supplying or offering to supply class A drugs; 16 for endangering the safety of an aircraft and 12 for child abduction.

A single caution was also recorded for other crimes such as soliciting to commit murder, perjury, misconduct in a public office, causing or allowing the death of a child or vulnerable person, bigamy and aggravated burglary.

GMP issued nearly 32,831 cautions between 1 April 2011, and 31 March 2016. During the whole period, the most common offence for which a caution was handed out was assault occasioning actual bodily harm (5,123 cautions).

However, the figures showed the force uses the sanction less frequently now than in 2011-12, when 8,977 were handed out compared with 4,358 in 2015-16.

Assistant chief constable Rob Potts, of GMP, defended the force, saying cautions were handed out for serious offences under exceptional circumstances.

He added: “A police caution is a formal warning given by the police to deliver swift and effective justice that carries a deterrent effect and reduces the likelihood of reoffending. A police caution can also act as a record for possible reference in future criminal proceedings.

“Each offence is dealt with on an individual basis and when a decision to issue a caution is taken, all evidence is considered to ensure this is the most appropriate course of action.

“Cautions are normally issued for more minor offences but no two cases are the same and all the circumstances are taken into account.”

Pentonville prison’s local MP has called for the Victorian jail to close as soon as possible, saying: “If inmates are escaping and being killed, what is the point of this prison?’

Emily Thornberry, the MP for Islington South and Finsbury and shadow foreign secretary, said she had repeatedly raised the issue of gangs controlling the walls of Pentonville and that the recent murder and this week’s escape had proved to be the final straw.

Police are still hunting the two escaped prisoners who fooled officers by leaving mannequins made of sheets and pillows in their cell beds, then used a diamond-cutter to break through their cell bars, before scaling the perimeter wall on Sunday night.

“People don’t seem to be safe inside Pentonville, and now it transpires inmates can escape. That is the final straw. If they don’t have control of the place, what is the point of it being there?” Thornberry told the Islington Gazette. “This was built in 1842 and is totally inappropriate for modern needs. It should have shut a long time ago, and needs to close as soon as possible.”

She said that for more than a year neither the prison nor the police had had control of the walls. Instead, gangs were controlling them and using drones to smuggle drugs and other contraband into the north London jail.

Pentonville was named by the former justice secretary, Michael Gove, as one of the first likely candidates to be shut under the government’s “new for old” programme in July when he called it the “most conspicuous” and “most dramatic example of failure within the prison estate”.

Thornberry’s demand came as the police appealed to anyone helping the two escaped prisoners, Matthew Baker and James Whitlock, to turn them in. “It is very likely they are being assisted by others, possibly with somewhere to stay, clothing and money – in order to evade capture,” said DCI Steve Heatley of the Metropolitan police. “I would appeal to anyone who is helping them that they are potentially committing a crime and would encourage them to contact us so that we can bring this matter to a safe and swift conclusion.”

The warning came after it emerged that there had been a further six stabbings inside the prison since Jamal Mahmoud, aged 21, was stabbed to death at Pentonville on 18 October. At least one of the subsequent attacks involved a razor blade with an inmate slashed across his face and back. Two men have been charged with murdering Mahmoud.

The two prisoners on the run are Baker, 28, who was found guilty of attempted murder two weeks ago and was due to be sentenced on Friday. The second was his cellmate, Whitlock, 31, who was on remand having been charged with conspiracy to burgle, namely 19 offences of theft from cash machines.

Baker posted on Facebook before his escape a warning to his enemies that that they would “meet again one day” and that he knew where they lived, the Sun reported. The Facebook page has been taken down but his message read: “Let’s get one thing straight to anyone who wants to say anythink behind my back. I know your names n where yous live n believe me we’ll meet again one day n i dont forget nothic just remember that yous know who yous are.”

A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said Liz Truss, the justice secretary, had been clear that the levels of violence in prisons were unacceptable.

The spokesperson said: “We announced a major overhaul of the prison system last week including 2,500 extra frontline officers. These extra officers and new safety measures will help us crack down on the toxic cocktail of drugs, drones and mobile phones that are flooding our prisons. Our measures will create prisons that are places of safety and reform giving prisoners the education and skills they need to turn their backs on crime for good.”

“Hi, I’m LawBot, a robot designed to help victims of crime in England.”

While volunteering at a school sexual consent class, Ludwig Bull, a law student at the University of Cambridge, was inspired to build a chatbot that offers free legal advice to students. He enlisted the help of four coursemates, and Lawbot was designed and built in just six weeks.

The program is still in beta, but Bull hopes it will help victims of crime, at Cambridge and beyond, to get justice. “A victim can talk to our artificially intelligent chatbot, receive a preliminary assessment of their situation, and then decide which available actions to pursue,” he says.

Bull explains that he was motivated by the alarming figures on sexual assault in the UK, where it is estimated that two thirds of offences go unreported, according to the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network (RAINN). The problem is especially urgent at universities, with the scale of abuse recently likened to the cases of Jimmy Savile or the Catholic church.

“Sexual assault was the first kind of offence we dealt with,” he says. “Much confusion surrounds the nature of consent. Individuals may feel as though they have been assaulted, but not actually be sure of their legal position.”

The program uses randomised, “empathetic” language choices, written in consultation with real-life therapists and psychologists. But the bot is unlikely to put flesh-and-blood criminal defence lawyers out of work any time soon. It has more in common with DoNotPay, the chatbot lawyer that helps with parking ticket appeals, designed by 19 year-old Joshua Browder. One difference, however, is that LawBot’s creators aim to address a wide range of criminal offences.

Given the complexity of the law, and the preference for simplicity when it comes to AI programming, it’s an ambitious project. “We’d like to expand to other areas of civil law, and we’re already in touch with German universities,” Bull says. “But we’re not out to make a program that provides a too-complex analysis. We really want to keep it as a starting point for victims.”

The team is planning a soft launch next week – and then users will be the judge of how helpful LawBot could really be.

Less well-off couples trying to separate through divorce proceedings are facing a “perfect storm” of court closures, legal aid cuts and bureaucratic breakdown, says Nigel Shepherd, the newly appointed head of the family law organisation Resolution, a 6,500-strong association which represents solicitors, barristers and other professionals involved in family law.

Shepherd, 60, who has taken up the post for the second time in his career, has already written to the new justice secretary, Liz Truss, pressing her department to carry out a review of the impact of the withdrawal of legal aid in most family cases.

Unless individuals can demonstrate they are victims of domestic violence, courtroom representation is no longer available under the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012. Advice “deserts”, areas where there are few agencies or solicitors able to give help, have begun to emerge. For poorer individuals who cannot afford a solicitor, the withdrawal of legal aid for family courts has caused a surge in litigants in person, whose claims, if pursued, take far longer to resolve, according to Shepherd. As many as 80% of all family law cases may now involve one party who is unrepresented.

“London has a real problem if you want a high court hearing [for divorce cases],” Shepherd says. “You may have to wait nine months to a year.” This means that custody battles are more protracted. Online divorce, being developed by the judiciary, is not yet available.

Local authority funding cuts have also made it harder to obtain reports from social workers, Shepherd says, pointing to the warning last month by Sir James Munby, who heads the family division, that family courts are facing a “clear and imminent crisis” because of the increase in childcare cases.

The Ministry of Justice’s austerity programme of court closures has placed further strains on access to justice. “There’s pressure from court closures; 86 in the latest slice. It means people have to travel a lot further – difficult for those who use public transport,” says Shepherd. Clients from parts of rural Cambridgeshire, who have to travel to Peterborough family court, for example, already have a two-hour journey each way involving several buses and a train, according to Resolution.

And the administration of family cases is also feeling the strain. Regional legal centres such as Bury St Edmunds, which is supposed to coordinate family cases across the south-east, are difficult to reach by phone, according to Shepherd. “One of my friends spent six hours trying to get through. It’s very frustrating. Service in the south is poor.”

Shepherd, who has worked as a family solicitor since 1981 and first chaired Resolution in the early 1990s, believes two changes would greatly improve outcomes for poorer households going through family breakdown: no-fault divorce and greater legal rights for cohabiting couples.

“Our key campaign is no-fault divorce,” he says.

There are around 110,000 divorces a year in England and Wales. No-fault divorce might reduce pressure on the courts, says Shepherd, since a lot of his work involves stripping away misconceptions divorcing couples hold, such as the belief that they are entitled to a larger share of assets if they can prove their partner was to blame for the breakdown.If separating partners realised they did not need to allocate blame, he believes, the process could be simplified. Although regulations allowing couples to dissolve unsuccessful marriages by mutual agreement without blame were included in the 1996 Family Law Act, they never came fully into force. In the face of a hostile Daily Mail campaign warning that they would undermine family life, Tony Blair’s Labour government decided not to proceed with changes that would have allowed couples to part after 12 months without having to apportion culpability. The powers were finally repealed by the 2014 Children and Families Act.

But as far as Shepherd is concerned, no-fault divorce is back on the political agenda. In September, the House of Commons Library produced a detailed briefing paper on the arguments surrounding the initiative and last year, Richard Bacon, the Conservative MP for South Norfolk, introduced a private member’s bill on no fault divorce.“None of the evidence suggests that when you change the law you get more divorces – other than a temporary blip when it’s first introduced.” Many countries allow no-fault divorce, including Spain and Scotland. But in England and Wales, unreasonable behaviour and adultery still account for more than two thirds of all divorces, as these are the main legal grounds that allow people to part straight away without waiting two years to get a mutually agreed divorce.

Shepherd believes no-fault divorces should be available after six months by mutual agreement. “There would have to be six months of separation,” Shepherd said. “We don’t want people to be able to wake up and get divorced. We are not anti-marriage, but we are anti-unnecessary conflict.

“At the moment it’s a blame game. [Lawyers] get together to talk about what we are going to put in the divorce petition. I would like to get rid of unreasonable behaviour, adultery and desertion. All other government policy is about trying to take the heat out of the situation.” Resolution’s other main campaign is extending legal rights to cohabiting couples, of which there are now 3.3 million in the UK, more than double the number 20 years ago. A couple can live together for 30 years, bringing up children, but if they are not married there is nothing to protect against hardship if the relationship collapses and only one of the couple, usually the man, owns the house and assets.

“We think [partners] ought to be able to claim [support and assets] after two years of cohabitation, or earlier if they have children,” Shepherd says. “Forty-seven per cent of the population [mistakenly] still believes there’s such a thing as ‘common law marriage’ [to give them rights].

“For some people it’s a complete disaster. It’s particularly hard on women who have given up their career to raise children,” he argues. “Scotland protects cohabitees legally. At the last count in 2013, 57% of MPs believe the law needs to be reformed.” Resolution is convening a debate tomorrow on how to improve cohabitation rights and a meeting in parliament at the end of the month.

Brexit is for many a traumatic divorce from the idea of the European Union. According to Shepherd, it is also fuelling marital breakdown. “We have come across a number of families in this country [who are splitting up] because one of them voted differently in the referendum,” he says.

“I suspect it was unlikely to have been the sole reason [for divorce], but we have heard of cases from a number of our members. It was a really divisive campaign. It pushed some couples [over the edge]. It was the last straw that made them think ‘we are really incompatible’.” Brexit is proving a challenge to the lawyers, too. “We prepare quite a lot of prenuptial agreements under the European system but we can’t say now where we would like issues determined,” Shepherd says. “We don’t know what marriage regulations will exist.”

In the end, much of the acrimony over divorce could be alleviated with greater clarity over financial settlements. Publishing some rough financial guidelines on the amounts of maintenance to be expected might help, he suggests.

“The problem is that the case law is up in the air; judges in southern England are more generous than those in the north when making maintenance awards. We [in London] are a generous jurisdiction for people seeking money. We are still the divorce capital of the world. There’s a battle between high court judges, so one judge may be at one end of the spectrum and one at the other. You can’t say either.”

Richard Keen speaks out as pressure mounts on Liz Truss to issue stronger defence of judges after article 50 case


###########################################################
The Lords’ spokesperson for the ministry of justice has condemned “ill-informed” media attacks on judges, as political pressure mounts for Liz Truss to speak out more clearly in defence of judicial independence.

Richard Keen’s comments follow a confrontation between the justice secretary and Conservative MPs at a private meeting on Monday night. They voiced concerns over Truss’s handling of the criticism of high court judges in the article 50 court case. The Daily Mail branded them “enemies of the people”.

Tory MPs at the meeting, many of them senior lawyers, are understood to have told Truss, who is also lord chancellor, there was “huge concern” among colleagues at the slowness of her response to the attacks by newspapers and politicians on Lord Thomas, the lord chief justice, the master of the rolls, Sir Terence Etherton, and Lord Justice Sales.

Truss told the MPs her initial silence on the issue had been an attempt to allow tempers to cool, but that the ministry would be faster to respond when the government’s appeal reached the supreme court in December.

She also said the job of defending the judiciary should fall to the lord chief justice in the first instance, an argument described by one source as “feeble” given that Thomas was one of those under attack.

Tory MPs said Truss’s explanations had been inadequate. She was “not in charge on the issues”, according to one.

In the House of Lords on Tuesday, the Conservative former justice minister Edward Faulks, a past critic of Truss, questioned Lord Keen about the issue.



“Last week saw a disgraceful attack on the judiciary,” Lord Faulks said. “Would you take this opportunity to show the government’s support for the entire cohort of the judiciary, whether it be the supreme court, the divisional court or the magistracy?”

Keen replied: “We have a judiciary of the highest calibre. We have a free press which is not always of the highest calibre.

“Sensationalist and ill-informed attacks can undermine public confidence in the judiciary. But our public can have every confidence in our judiciary and it is a confidence, I believe, that must be shared by the executive.”

The Conservative chair of the Commons justice select committee, Bob Neil, issued a statement, saying it condemned personal attacks on members of the judiciary.

“Free debate should not be couched in terms of abuse of individuals who, by virtue of the oath they have taken and the role they discharge, cannot defend themselves publicly,” he said. “It is quite wrong to vilify or attack judges or attempt to intimidate or undermine them. The right of the press to speak freely must be exercised responsibly; it is not a licence to attack judges in a personal manner or seek to undermine the constitutional principle of judicial independence, which is absolute.”

The human rights lawyer Philippe Sands called on Truss to resign, saying she had irrevocably lost the confidence of the legal profession.

Labour’s shadow justice secretary, Richard Burgon, said Truss’s response had been too little, too late, and public confidence in the judiciary had been undermined as a result.

The Bingham Centre for the Rule of Law announced that it had invited Truss to deliver a public lecture under the title: “What is the rule of law? What does it require?”

It said in a statement: “The lord chancellor has a constitutional and statutory duty that is unique within government. The Constitutional Reform Act 2005 sets out the duty, encapsulated by the lord chancellor swearing an oath to ‘respect the rule of law’ and ‘defend the independence of the judiciary’.

“A lord chancellor’s lecture would … be a vital step forward in giving the conversation the depth and prominence it needs in national life, and in giving substance to what the rule of law is, the lord chancellor’s role, and what it means to respect the rule of law.”

The Ministry of Justice declined to comment or to challenge the Tory MPs’ assertion that Truss believed it was the lord chief justice’s initial responsibility to defend the judiciary.

On Saturday, Truss released a short statement saying: “The independence of the judiciary is the foundation upon which our rule of law is built and our judiciary is rightly respected the world over for its independence and impartiality. In relation to the case heard in the high court, the government has made it clear it will appeal to the supreme court. Legal process must be followed.”

In a separate development, six high court judges have launched an employment tribunal challenge against Truss, alleging illegal discrimination over their pension rights on the basis of their age. 



The judges are Sir Nicholas Mostyn, 59, Sir Roderick Newton, 58, Sir Philip Moor, 57, Dame Lucy Theis, 55, Sir Richard Arnold, 55, and Sir Rabinder Singh, 52. They claim the pension scheme, introduced in April last year, penalises them because of their ages.

Younger judges are either automatically enrolled on the new scheme, which the claimants’ lawyers say is less favourable in terms of benefits, or come on to it after a transitional period.

In another case a district judge, Claire Gilham, who lost her challenge against the Ministry of Justice over whistleblowing complaints about courtroom dangers – including death threats, violent claimants and hostage-taking – has been given permission to appeal.

Twenty-two people face civil and criminal investigations into suspected tax evasion following the disclosure of the Panama Papers, the chancellor has told MPs.

Philip Hammond also said a further 43 wealthy individuals were under review while their links to the offshore files were investigated further. He made the comments in a written answer to the House of Commons explaining what had happened since the offshore tax files emerged.

In April, David Cameron announced the creation of a cross-agency taskforce to analyse all the information available from the Panama Papers, a series of articles in the Guardian and other international newspapers based on a huge leak of documents from the law firm Mossack Fonseca.

Hammond told the house on Tuesday that the taskforce had “added greatly to the UK’s understanding of the ever-more complex and contrived structures that are being developed to mask offshore tax evasion and economic crime”. 



He said some people had approached the tax authorities to settle their affairs before action was taken.

Links had been established to eight active Serious Fraud Office inquiries, he said, and several law enforcement authorities were involved in the wider investigation, including the Financial Conduct Authority and the National Crime Agency. 



The NCA had identified 26 offshore companies whose beneficial ownership of UK property was previously concealed and whose financial activity had been identified as “potentially suspicious”. A further two properties and a number of companies relevant to an NCA financial sanctions inquiry had also been identified. In another joint investigation with the FCA, the NCA had identified a number of leads relevant to a major insider-trading operation.

The Guardian’s reporting of the Panama Papers revealed that lawyers and accountants in the UK were working with Mossack Fonseca clients. Hammond said on Tuesday that the taskforce had identified nine potential “professional enablers” of economic crime, all of whom had links with known criminals. The taskforce had contacted a further 64 firms to determine their links with Mossack Fonseca, and this was expected to establish potential further avenues for investigation, he said.



HMRC’s director general for customer compliance, Jennie Granger, said: “The net is closing in on tax evasion and economic crime and there are no safe havens for hiding money offshore. The vast majority of individuals and businesses pay their fair share and it’s on their behalf that the taskforce has made so much progress on so many fronts.”

HMRC declined to comment on whether it had obtained the entirety of the Panama Papers leak, which totalled more than 11.5m files and 2.5 terabytes of data. However, the Danish government paid up to £1m to acquire some or all of the data earlier this year and international tax authorities have been known to share information on possible tax abuse in the past.

A HMRC spokesperson said: “For operational reasons, we do not disclose how we acquire our data. We will continue to work with our international partners, and law enforcement agencies, to obtain any further relevant information that enables us to crack down on tax avoidance, evasion and economic crime.”

Rob Palmer, the campaign leader on money laundering at the anti-corruption organisation Global Witness, said specific references to “enablers of economic crime” represented a more aggressive stance on criminal finance than had previously been exhibited by the government.

“From our perspective, it’s really important that you go after the pinstripe army of bankers, accountants and lawyers that make all of this stuff possible,” he said.

Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said: “The fact that the government have sneaked this out in a written statement just before recess probably says all you need to know about how seriously they are really taking the issue of tackling tax avoidance.

“The Tories are clearly trying to hide that they have been dragging their feet on this issue for six years now, and on the same day they have been caught trying to stop tax havens from being blacklisted by the EU, no one will be convinced by their lacklustre attempts at clamping down on those that use them.”

If there was a current day version of the famous Harry Enfield spoof commercial, it would be “Brown and Black Women: Know Your Limits!” These past few days have demonstrated that you have no business either dating royals or leading campaigns to uphold parliamentary sovereignty. You see, there’s only one thing worse than a woman who does not know her place, and that is a non-white woman who does not know her place.

In a nation still reeling from Gina Miller allegedly launching a campaign against Britain’s sovereignty, along came Meghan Markle to romantically ensnare an actual sovereign.

Granted, Markle’s relationship with Harry was always going to send tabloid hounds her way, but the fixation on her racial background, the digging into her family’s past to make tenuous trite points about her being a descendant of slaves in a relationship with a royal, the pearl-clutching at her dreadlocked mother and the consequent potential threat to the purity of the royal bloodline, were all so intense that today it prompted Prince Harry to issue a statement, striking in its tone of genuine indignation. He mentioned in particular “the smear on the front page of a national newspaper; the racial undertones of comment pieces; and the outright sexism and racism of social media trolls and web article comments”. When affable, privileged, non-woke wearer of Nazi fancy dress Harry issues a press release abhorring the “racial undertones” of the media, you know we have a problem.

The air was already thick with the resentment against Gina Miller, another woman who does not know her place. Not only does she pretend to know something about British law, but dares to lead a whole campaign in the most toxic of environments when the stakes could not be higher. Once the pictures of Miller surfaced it was clear that she was in for a rough ride. One could almost hear the snap of the gloves coming off. The backlash, even in a post-Brexit land when we are daily and wearily becoming accustomed and numbed to racial injury, was staggering. She received threats of everything from sexual abuse to death. Even the most diluted of media coverage subliminally communicated the question, who does she think she is?

Depressingly, these women were always going to get abuse just for being female, and in Miller’s case, even if she had been a man. But the multiple offences – of being a woman, of colour, attractive, and most infuriatingly of all, of refusing to be downtrodden – meant it was inevitable that Miller’s principled campaign, even if you don’t agree with her, was collapsed into the view that she was an uppity social climber who had somehow inveigled her way into a position of power.

At Miller the dog whistles screeched, “foreign born”, “thrice married”, “ex-model”, “privately educated”. Likewise, Markle is “unfit”, “pushy”, the daughter of a woman whose family “almost certainly included slaves”. All this is shorthand for the offence of trespassing on the manicured lawn of “our” businesses. It is not possible that these women have any motivations that are genuine, let alone any innate ability or right to care for their country or simply to fall in love. Mix this bigotry with garden variety misogyny and in effect you have a recipe for a ban from active public life.

It was ever thus, and it is increasingly common, whatever your race or gender, to be attacked for whatever sets you apart from the acceptable mainstream (such as being an openly gay ex-Olympic fencer), but there is an increasingly acceptable nativist edge to it all, and it is alarming how much it is not alarming. On this, one part of Prince Harry’s statement in particular resonated. “He knows commentators will say this is ‘the price she has to pay’ and that ‘this is all part of the game’. He strongly disagrees. This is not a game – it is her life and his.” There is a certain resignation at the inevitability of all of this, which many, including myself, are guilty of.

When I first saw Gina Miller reading out her statement on the steps of the high court, and when the first pictures of Meghan Markle emerged, I thought, God help them: as if it were the start of a grim game to which we all know the rules and which they are destined to play. It is not a game and there is no “price one has to pay” when women such as Markle and Miller don’t know their limits. Here’s hoping they never do.

Liz Truss, the justice secretary, unveiled her prisons white paper last week; it contained a proposal to create five new community prisons to house women ahead of release. With around 3,900, mainly vulnerable, women locked up in English jails and 19 deaths already recorded this year (the highest for 12 years), the reforms can’t come too soon, say campaigners.

For inspiration on how to deliver her vision, Truss need not travel far. On a recent visit to Scotland, I caught a glimpse of how a modern, progressive country should be treating women who break the law.

When Scotland’s justice minister, Michael Matheson, took office in 2014, he announced plans to build a new prison to hold just 80 women deemed too dangerous for freedom, and five small regional units, where most women offenders would be offered help with drugs, alcohol, domestic abuse and mental health problems.

Cornton Vale women’s prison, in Stirling, is due for demolition in 2020 under Matheson’s plans to make way for the new secure unit. In the meantime, it is pioneering a new approach to women in custody that will continue in the new facility.

The first thing to notice as I begin an informal tour with the prison governor, Rhona Hotchkiss, is the silence. We are in Ross House, the smaller of the two existing units, holding around 20 prisoners – a mixture of new receptions and those, Hotchkiss says, with “challenging behaviour”. Reception blocks and those housing prisoners with behavioural issues usually teem with noise; keys jangling, doors banging, staff bellowing orders and women venting their frustrations. But silence mostly reigns, apart from the hum of chatter from the prisoners, none of them locked in their cells. It is not accidental; staff at Cornton Vale operate under a “no shouting” rule (a first, for this prison watcher). And it appears the prisoners reciprocate.

Then, something happens which, in most prisons, would be regarded as an “incident”. A prisoner approaches Hotchkiss and grabs her by the arm. Clearly agitated, the woman speaks rapidly. The governor listens intently, then replies in quiet tones. Clearly calming down, the woman releases her hold. Hotchkiss then places her hand on the woman’s arm before moving on. Out of earshot, I ask Hotchkiss if the woman taking hold of her had been an issue? “No,” she replies, “she’s a vulnerable young woman, we need to engage.” The woman – and every other prisoner we encountered – called the governor by her first name.

Peebles House, the second of the two remaining units at Cornton Vale, is even quieter, even though the women were also unlocked, as they are from morning until 9pm, barring an hour at lunchtime. It has corridors, and rooms, all carpeted. The accent is squarely on the wellbeing of the women. Hotchkiss says that 70% of the women suffer mental health problems, and only 20% have received mental health care in the community. Self-harm is an issue, with 15 incidents in a month recorded recently, but all were carried out by just three women.

“Mary”, serving a long sentence for violence, tells me she feels safe in Cornton and the programmes she is on make her feel confident about the future. “The staff care,” she says. “There is no sense of them and us.” Hotchkiss says the various programmes are all based on trauma reduction and education. “We need to know what works, and why. It’s a hugely exciting time to be working in prisons,” she adds.

I see women making greeting cards to send to friends and relatives. It is popular, but poignantly Hotchkiss talks of a 19-year-old prisoner who didn’t want to take part. When asked why, she said she had “nobody outside to send a card to”. Two days a week, PAT (pets as therapy) dogs come into the prison – it’s one of the schemes that “works” says Hotchkiss.

This summer, around 80 women were transferred from Cornton Vale to a part of Polmont young offenders institution (YOI) in Falkirk, some 20 miles away. Space was available at Polmont because Scotland’s YOI population has reduced significantly in recent years. Here too, the focus is on women’s health and education.

Susan Brookes has governed Polmont for four years. The women learn in small, individual-based programmes. It might be citizenship, parenting or grief and loss. Brookes says the number of women and young offenders who have suffered multiple bereavements is high. Staff work in partnership with outside agencies, aiming for a better understanding of women’s routes into – and out of – offending. Staff and teachers say many women and young prisoners share traumatic histories. Officer Michael Wilson oversees a hi-tech media centre at Polmont, where prisoners operate a prison radio station which broadcasts around the clock. He says the women and young men often present with similar problems, all related to troubled backgrounds. “Every prisoner has their own problems; it’s a challenge, but a rewarding one,” he says.

“Amy” is several years into a life sentence. She’s in no doubt that change is afoot. “I see it all the time … just the way staff speak to you, get to know you. It was never like this before. Now I feel more comfortable telling them things and that’s a good feeling,” she says.

Blair House, which holds Polmont’s women, is very much a prison wing, albeit much brighter than most. The cells here are also unlocked all day and women come and go at will within its confines. There is a well equipped gym, running and rowing machines and weight pulleys. Brookes says the “fundamentals” of her job are good relationships between staff and prisoners, with staff properly trained and responsive. Prison governors in Scotland are lucky: there have been no staff cuts here, as have happened in English and Welsh prisons. In fact, Polmont, with 375 staff for 533 prisoners, exceeds its staffing levels. (Portland prison, Dorset, with an almost identical roll call, has 255 staff.)

It is too soon, however, to assess the impact of Scotland’s reforms on women’s reoffending rates. The latest figures, up to 2014, show around 45% of women leaving custody in Scotland are reconvicted within a year compared to 48% in England. (There are no women’s prisons in Wales.)

In 2015, women made up more than 5% of the Scottish prison population, the second highest female prison population in northern Europe and second only to Spain. Matheson describes the figures as “totally unacceptable”, and says that “housing women in smaller community-based units, closer to their families and alongside support services” helps them with drug, alcohol and mental health issues. “It means we can stop them committing further crimes.”

Although the five new units will be run by prison staff, they will be broadly based on an existing residential centre, operated jointly by the charity Turning Point and Glasgow Addiction Services. Simply called 218, the 12-bed residential unit occupies a handsome city-centre building in Glasgow that is identifiable only by building number.

It mainly takes women referred by local courts and social services and accepted after an assessment process, looking at individual needs. The residential service provides supported accommodation for women from between four weeks and six months, and also runs day groups for non-residents. Many of their service users are subject to statutory supervision and have a range of complex needs, including substance misuse, mental and physical health problems, issues relating to domestic abuse, trauma, housing problems, or patterns of repeat offending.

It opened in 2003, with the objective of reducing the number of women from the Glasgow area being remanded in custody and/or receiving a custodial sentence. Traditionally, Glasgow has always provided a large slice of Scotland’s jail population, both male and female. But a two-year evaluation study, carried out between 2007 and 2009, showed the percentage of female prisoners hailing from Glasgow had been cut from 33% to 13%. And while the total number of Scotland’s female prisoners had more than doubled during that period, Glaswegian numbers fell by a quarter. The same study showed that reoffending figures for women referred to 218 between 2007-09 were reduced by 21%.

At the unit, each woman is assigned a key worker and, according to their needs, access to an impressive range of physical and mental health facilities. Alternative therapies such as acupuncture and Indian head massage sit alongside dental and physical health, psychological/psychiatric services and detoxification. There are 12 full-time staff, including managers and two full-time nurses. The women live in bright, single rooms, wear name tags and carry fob passes indistinguishable from those carried by staff. Margaret Nkembou, the service coordinator, says “brew and blether” sessions, where women relax and talk over their issues are an important part of the programmes.

“Kelly”, a former resident, is now a key worker at 218. She is one of three staff who have made the transition from offender to practitioner. Kelly says her understanding of the issues facing her charges is important. “I have been where they are,” she says. “It gives me a connection.” She says her work continues to assist her own recovery. Kelly has served 12 years in jail, over several sentences, but calls them “wasted years”. “There was no rehabilitation. Being on the 218 programme made me feel part of the process, and allowed me to make positive decisions about my future,” she says.

From April 2015 to March 2016, of the 173 women who signed up with 218, just nine failed to complete their programmes. Nkembou points out that many of the women have a history of not engaging with agencies, so to start and complete a programme is a hugely positive step. The staff keep in contact with all their former service users; “graduation days”, when women collect their certificates, are always well attended. “There are wonderful moments when a woman says she can’t attend because she’s working!” says Nkembou.

Prison reformers believe most of the solutions to women’s offending do not lie behind prison walls. “There are still too may women being sent to prison for minor offences, including on remand and for short sentences,” says Yvonne Donald, Scotland and Northern Ireland manager for the Prison Reform Trust.

Yet a decade after the Corston report on women in the criminal justice system recommended a fundamental rethink about locking up women and instead providing support in the community, many of these reforms are finally being enacted in Scotland, giving the English justice secretary an example close to home that she would do well to follow.

As Donald says: “The Scottish government’s reforms are heading very much in the right direction.”

Anti-gay laws in Commonwealth countries are “totally out of date, highly inappropriate and should be changed”, the UK’s deputy foreign secretary has said.

Alan Duncan promised MPs the Foreign Office was “fighting in every capital in the world” to block a surprise African nations-led move at the UN general assembly to end or delay the appointment of a UN expert to champion LGBT rights. Many of the countries trying to block the proposed mandate are Commonwealth members.

The move at the UN was expected to be made either on Tuesday or later in the week, and there had been frustration in the Labour party at the reluctance of the FCO to set out its view in public.

Duncan admitted the FCO had been surprised by the sudden move by the African nations, and only became aware of the plan on Friday, but was resisting it.

Duncan, one of the first openly gay Conservative MPs, promised there was “a complete starburst of UK diplomatic effort” in the FCO to assemble a coalition to defeat the African nations-led move.

Duncan said: “All people are born with equal rights and should enjoy the protection of the UN.” He said “the UK will resist any and all attempts” to block the mandate of the new LGBT champion.

The UN human rights council voted in June to appoint an independent LGBT expert for the first time to monitor “violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity” around the world. Prof Vitit Muntarbhorn was handed the role last month and was due to investigate abuse against the global LGBT community.

African nations and some Islamic states said gay rights should not be regarded as a human right, and want his mandate revoked at a meeting of the UN general assembly in a vote scheduled either for Tuesday or Thursday. African nations are also concerned that sexual orientation and gender identity was being given attention “to the detriment of issues of paramount importance, such as the right to development and the racism agenda”, he said.

The push at the UN is being led by Botswana and has the potential to turn into a wider battle over anti-gay laws in the Commonwealth. Although Duncan said the days were over when the UK could instruct Commonwealth nations what laws to adopt, he urged the Commonwealth to stop lagging behind on gay rights. He resisted suggestions that UK aid should be conditional on countries’ stance on gay rights since that may punish innocent people.

The Labour shadow minister for equality, Sarah Champion, wrote to the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, earlier this week. “I am extremely concerned that African nations are now seeking to initially suspend the UN’s first independent expert charged with investigating violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity,” she wrote.

“You will of course understand the strong imperative for such a role to exist and the very real implications for LGBT individuals all over the world who continue to be subject to the most appalling and systemic discrimination, hatred and violence.

“According to a UN human rights report last year, at least 76 countries retain laws used to criminalise and target people on the basis of their sexual orientation and gender identity, including laws criminalising consensual same-sex relationships among adults.”

A Labour MP is pressing the government to increase the penalties for animal cruelty offences, noting that research shows people who harm animals are more likely to go on to commit crimes such as domestic abuse.

Anna Turley was due to use a Westminster Hall speech on Tuesday afternoon to raise awareness before a private member’s bill is introduced seeking to raise the maximum jail term possible for animal cruelty.

The Redcar MP said she had been alerted to the issue after two brothers in her constituency received suspended sentences and tagging orders after carrying out what RSPCA inspectors said was the most horrifying abuse they had seen.

Andrew and Daniel Frankish were filmed hurling the family’s pet bulldog down the stairs of their home and stamping on it. After a mobile phone memory card containing the footage was found on the floor of a supermarket, they were convicted of causing unnecessary suffering to an animal.

Turley said she had been shocked to learn that the maximum jail term for such offences was six months, having not been changed since 1911. A 2005 proposal to increase this to a year has not been enacted.

“It was so surprising, and so I thought this has to be remedied,” Turley said. “I feel we have an overwhelming case here so I’m hoping the government will take action.”

Westminster Hall debates allow backbench MPs to highlight issues they believe are important or neglected. In her speech, Turley was to point to research indicating that those who abuse animals often go on to commit offences against people.

“Because abusers target the powerless, crimes against animals, spouses, children and the elderly often go hand in hand,” she was to say. “Children who abuse animals may be repeating a lesson learned at home; like their parents, they are reacting to anger or frustration with violence. Their violence is directed at the only individual in the family who is more vulnerable than they are: an animal.”

US research has shown abuse of pets is a key predictor of domestic violence against a partner, and about three-quarters of women going to domestic violence shelters said their partners also abused the family pet.



Turley also pointed to a study from Teesside University that identified a link between animal abuse and domestic violence.

She said: “It’s quite shocking the correlation, particularly between domestic violence and animal cruelty. If we can raise awareness of this issue we can hopefully prevent further cruelty, both to animals and to people.”

Turley argues that a perception that penalties are too low for animal cruelty offences can cause public anger. After the case of the Frankish brothers was reported, local people marched on the home. The family was later reported to have moved out after windows of the house were smashed.

Dame Lowell Goddard, the former chair of the independent inquiry into child sex abuse, has been branded “a disgrace” for refusing to answer questions from MPs about her resignation.

Yvette Cooper, the chair of the Commons home affairs select committee, said the New Zealand former high court judge’s refusal to give evidence even by videolink was “an astonishing response” from a paid public servant.

MPs are now urgently considering whether they can compel Goddard to give evidence to the committee should she set foot in Britain again.

Goddard’s refusal to answer any further questions from MPs either by returning to London or by videolink from New Zealand was made clear in a letter she sent to Cooper on Monday in which she claimed that doing so would pose “an unacceptable risk” that “malicious defamatory attacks in some UK media could be repeated”.

Goddard said the letter would be her final act relating to her former position as chair of the inquiry, and she would no longer be responding to requests for interviews or comments.

Goddard received £360,000 a year plus allowances and flights home during the 18 months she served as the inquiry chair and secured an £80,000 payoff after her resignation on 4 August. She was the third chair to resign since the child sex abuse inquiry was set up in July 2014.

Cooper condemned her “disgraceful response”. She said: “Dame Goddard has been paid significant amounts of public money to do an extremely important job which she suddenly resigned from, leaving a series of questions about what has been happening over the last 18 months and why the inquiry got into difficulties.

“Yet rather than give oral evidence to answer these questions she is relying on the fact that she is out of the UK to avoid the requirement to give evidence to parliament. This is an astonishing response from a paid public servant who should know how important transparency is in an inquiry as sensitive and crucial as this one.

“Child abuse survivors have been let down by the extremely rocky start to this inquiry and we do need answers as to why it went wrong in order to be confident it is back on track now.”

In her letter to the home affairs committee, Goddard accused the government of failing to defend her when she was accused of racism. A report in the Times alleged Goddard had a troubling record of making racist and derogatory remarks during her time as head of the inquiry, and of acting abusively towards junior staff members.

“I am disappointed that there has been no government defence of me in England, despite the fact that information refuting some of the more serious allegations has been held by the Home Office and your committee since the time of my initial recruitment,” she wrote in the letter released by her husband on Tuesday.

She declined to provide oral evidence to the committee and said her focus on providing “formal, comprehensive reports” to the Home Office was a means of maintaining her “judicial independence”.

“As a high court judge in New Zealand for many years before I resigned to take up the chair of the IICSA [independent inquiry into child sexual abuse], I have a duty to maintain judicial independence. That is why I have volunteered detailed written reports [in preference to oral communication] so that no dispute on powers or damage to IICSA’s independence could arise. I am not aware of any matter which remains unanswered,” she wrote.

We all believe in freedom of speech. But freedom of speech must be exercised responsibly. Last Thursday’s judgment from the high court on article 50 led to artificial hysteria in many quarters. There were headlines declaring that the judges who heard the case were “Enemies of the people”; references alluding to the sexuality of a judge briefly appeared on the Daily Mail’s website; and a member of the cabinet, Sajid Javid, ominously stated that “This is an attempt to frustrate the will of the British people and it is unacceptable”.

Many have said that those headlines and comments “crossed the line”. And in our constitution, when judicial independence is threatened, the lord chancellor has a legal duty to intervene. Liz Truss, however, failed to say anything for nearly 48 hours and when she did, she simply recited the principle of the independence of the judiciary and stated the government would be appealing against the judgment. She did not condemn the fact that our judges had been declared “enemies of the people”, nor that the sexuality of a judge had been introduced in to the debate.

When Truss took office she swore an oath to uphold the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law. In her speech that day she committed to doing so “with dedication”. The headlines which appeared in a number of newspapers the day after the high court ruling in the article 50 case was the first test of her commitment. On any reasonable measure, she failed that test.

That’s not just my view. The former lord chief justice, Lord Judge, was interviewed on Radio 4 on Sunday and said this: “The lord chancellor has a specific function and in this case her responsibility, where there has been vituperative criticism of judges, damaging to public confidence in the administration of justice by an independent judiciary, is to speak up for them and explain exactly what the principles are.”

He went on to say about Truss’s response to the attacks: “I think it was a little too late and I think it’s quite a lot too little. Because it doesn’t actually address the damage to public confidence consequent on [these] kind of headlines.”

During my 10 years as a lawyer before being elected to parliament and then becoming shadow lord chancellor, there were occasions when I disagreed with – or was disappointed with – judges’ decisions. When I lost a case, I was disappointed. When I won a case, the lawyer on the other side was disappointed. But we would never tolerate our judiciary being declared as “against the people” or a judge’s sexuality being brought into the debate.

Anyone is free to disagree with a judge’s decision, their reasoning – or lack of it – or their interpretation of the law. But what is surely unacceptable is attacks on the independence of the judiciary by government ministers and powerful government-backing newspapers. The lord chancellor has a duty to act in these circumstances and she failed.

It took a bar council resolution demanding action to draw her into the open. And then she provided a statement carefully crafted to say as little as possible, which has only attracted further criticism. And since then she has remained out of sight. Conservative MPs mindful of the rule of law have criticised her publicly and, reportedly, privately, at a fractious meeting of Tory MPs at which she is supposed to have said that it is the job of the lord chief justice to defend the judiciary. Actually, it is Truss’s statutory responsibility – and the lord chief justice is one of the judges who heard the case and is being maligned.

I know Truss has a lot on, given the crisis of violence and underfunding that has developed in our prison service, but for many in the legal community, studied silence on this specific matter means a lord chancellor loses their trust and confidence. Her failure to speak out has consequences: only yesterday afternoon, during a debate on Brexit in the Commons, David Davis repeatedly failed to condemn the headlines when asked. Other MPs have spoken about the judiciary “interfering between parliament and the executive”.

Whether it’s respecting the outcome of referendums (even when the result disappoints the Labour party) or defending the independence of the judiciary, Labour is the party of the rule of law. A mature democracy – and a mature government – doesn’t stand by while the judiciary gets a roasting.

“Austerity” is a term so abstract that, during the televised leaders debates at the last general election, the most commonly Googled phrase in Britain was “what is austerity?” That was after five years of it. Yes, workers suffered the longest squeeze in their wages since the 19th century, but the fall in living standards was somehow decoupled from the issue of cuts. Government cuts pursued the following strategy: to target people who were less likely to vote (such as young people) and who preferably were held in low esteem by wider society (such as benefit claimants); or where the consequences would not be felt for a long time. A case in point: the prison system.

Over the last few days, the crisis enveloping Britain’s prison system stopped being a warning scribbled in press releases. It become an actuality. This weekend, up to 200 inmates rioted in Bedford prison. Yesterday, two prisoners escaped from Pentonville prison and are now on the run. And on the same day, there were reports of a riot in Exeter prison.

Our Victorian prison system – which is more interested in locking up mentally ill poor people than rehabilitation and crime prevention – is overcrowded, under-staffed and underresourced. No one can say the warnings weren’t there. While our prison population doubled in the space of two decades, last week the Prison Officers’ Association warned that falling staff numbers and cuts mean a “bloodbath in prisons”, adding that “staff are absolutely on their knees, lost all morale, all motivation”. Opponents of cuts are frequently accused of alarmism: we are now seeing how prophetic they were.

Some of the other consequences of austerity are becoming visible, too. A UN inquiry has condemned government cuts for “systematic violations” of the rights of disabled people, whether it be the bedroom tax or cuts to disability benefits. And today the Trussell Trust reports that – partly due to benefit sanctions and delays in social security payments – it is set to deliver the biggest number of emergency food parcels ever. After Britain was battered by floods over the festive period last year, it was revealed how cuts to flood defences had put households at risk.

The danger is that – even as these cuts hit – they will remain abstractions, headlines to goggle at and then turn the page. Those most badly affected can all too easily be ignored. But the failure to invest in a country’s future means we will all increasingly suffer the consequences. We are beginning to see what some of them are.

Angry Conservative MPs confronted the justice secretary, Liz Truss, at a private meeting on Monday night, voicing concerns over her handling of the criticism of high court judges in the article 50 court case.

Tory MPs at the meeting, many with backgrounds as senior lawyers, are understood to have told the lord chancellor there was “huge concern” among colleagues at the slowness of her response to the attacks on Lord Thomas, the lord chief justice, the master of the rolls Sir Terence Etherton and Lord Justice Sales in newspapers and by politicians.

Last week, the high court said the government did not have the authority to trigger article 50, the two-year process for leaving the EU, without putting it before parliament.

The judgment, which the government is appealing against at the supreme court, sparked a backlash on front pages, including the Daily Telegraph and Daily Mail, which called the judges “enemies of the people”.

MPs said Truss had failed to quell the febrile atmosphere of public debate around the ruling, and should have made it publicly clear that the judgment was not about the Brexit argument but about the procedure for leaving.

“Her job is to defend judiciary from attack, and while she is not required to attack the Daily Mail she should have disassociated the government from their attacks,” one Conservative source said.

Sajid Javid, the communities secretary, was also criticised by fellow Tories at the meeting, though he did not attend, for saying last Thursday the ruling was “an attempt to frustrate the will of the British people”.

Conservative MPs told Truss they believed Javid’s appearance on BBC1’s Question Time had been a “low moment” for the government and that Truss should have been prepared in advance for attacks and willing to defend an independent judiciary.

The lord chancellor told MPs her initial silence on the issue had been an attempt to cool tempers, rather than pour oil on the fire, but said the department would be faster in responding when the case got to the supreme court in December.

However, MPs were said to have been less than impressed when Truss said the job of defending the judiciary should fall to the lord chief justice in the first instance, an argument described by one source as “feeble” give that Lord Thomas was one of those under attack for giving the judgment.

Tory MPs said Truss’s explanations at the meeting had been inadequate. She was “not in charge on the issues”, one said.

Pressure is mounting on Truss from legal quarters. The renowned human rights lawyer Philippe Sands called for her to resign, saying she had lost the confidence of the profession and it could not be recovered.

Sands, who has acted in cases involving the former Yugoslavia, Rwanda and Sierra Leone – including at the international criminal court – tweeted:

On Monday, 17 QCs from prominent chambers 1 Crown Office Row wrote to Truss saying they were dismayed by her “inadequate” defence of the high court judges.

After entreaties over the weekend, Truss said the independence of the judiciary was “the foundation upon which our rule of law is built” but stopped short of condemning the attacks.

In their letter, the silks said the statement “failed to spell out in clear terms that the judges in question had simply been ruling on the dispute, had not been motivated by bias and to accuse them of trying to thwart the will of the people was dangerously to misrepresent what they had done”.

The former justice secretary Michael Gove, a leading member of the leave campaign, wrote on Twitter on Monday night that the three judges were “brilliant, thoughtful, wise and decent men – their judgment deserves respect”.

He said he found much of the judgment “persuasive” and although he “didn’t agree with elements of their reasoning I’d personally treat the judgment of three brilliant men with respect”.

Freedom of the press should also be respected, Gove said. “A raucous, vigorous, press is just as much a guarantor of freedom as our independent judiciary,” he said. “People who object to what they damn as irrational tabloid media often deploy visceral and instinctive arguments themselves.”

Prosecutors are failing to tackle “honour crimes” in British Asian communities for fear of causing unrest, a Scotland Yard whistleblower has said.

The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has “denied justice” to victims, Det Sgt Pal Singh told the Daily Telegraph. He said he has witnessed what he believes to be serious miscarriages of justice and felt it was in the “public interest” that he speak out.

The serving officer said: “There appears to be an apathy from the CPS when prosecuting cases where Asian women are victims of ‘honour’-based violence.

“A conviction could lead to unrest in the affected community but if they discontinue a case they know most victims won’t complain due to their vulnerability.”

He told the paper he was prompted to speak publicly after the CPS dropped a forced marriage charge in a case because it said it was unable to locate the victim.

But Det Sgt Singh said he had written to the CPS saying the 27-year-old victim from south London would attend court.

The CPS instead said it would continue with the charges of false imprisonment and common assault and wrote to Det Sgt Singh apologising for not consulting him before dropping the charge.

Figures published by the CPS in September showed there were no successful prosecutions under a specific forced marriage offence in 2015/16, after its introduction in 2014.

However, the report showed there were 53 prosecutions flagged as forced marriage in 2015/16, with six in 10 of those leading to convictions. One defendant was convicted of breaching a forced marriage protection order.

A CPS spokesman said: “These crimes are among the most complex referred to the CPS by police and, as recent statistics show, all agencies involved have major challenges to overcome.

“We recognise that it can be very difficult for victims to come forward, report these crimes and maintain their support during a prosecution, due to the nature of the offences.

“Victims will often be reluctant to criminalise their families, and can feel isolated. The CPS recognises that ‘honour’-based violence and forced marriage are fields in which we need to improve our understanding, response and support to victims.

“We have recently launched a new Honour Based Violence and Forced Marriage Action Plan, which outlines the comprehensive steps we are taking to improve our performance in this area.”

Prime minister repeatedly attacked Labour for signing up to EU social chapter that includes part-time workers’ directive

Marjorie Greenfield has many stories to tell about how employers are failing to create a workplace that encourages women to excel.

Greenfield, author of The Working Women’s Pregnancy Book, recalls an interview with a female pilot who worked for an airline that didn’t allow women to fly during the first and third trimesters of pregnancy because of morning sickness and fatigue. The first time the pilot became pregnant, she notified her boss immediately and was taken off work, despite feeling fine.

So when she was pregnant with her second child, she kept the news secret until her second trimester so she could continue working.

The story of the pilot shows the complexity of finding the right approach to help employees balance work and pregnancy without making them feel unproductive or worse – less competent. Failing to do so could cost employers significant money: a new study found that the more help a pregnant woman received at work, the more she wanted to quit her job after her baby was born.

“There are unintended consequences of well intentioned efforts to support women,” said Judith Clair, associate professor in the management and organization department at Boston College in Massachusetts and co-author of the study. “Some of those efforts can backfire.”

Clair and her three co-authors tracked 120 working pregnant women and had them fill out weekly surveys about their experiences at work. They then followed up with the women nine months after their babies were born to see how the support that they received at work while pregnant influenced their career decisions postpartum.

The study found that women who received more help were more likely to develop negative views about their abilities to be working mothers. The type of help mattered. Pregnant women tended to be grateful for practical help, such as getting to leave early for a doctor’s appointment, or being allowed to take a short nap during working hours.

More problematic was help that aimed to ease employees’ workload and stress, such as being taken off a challenging assignment when the employee felt capable of taking it on. The negative reaction reflects a psychological theory called the “threat-to-self-esteem” model, in which assistance can sometimes confirm the fears of people who already question whether they are performing as well as usual.

According to the study, women do worry about their job performance during pregnancy and how they will balance competing demands, such as coping with morning sickness while still keeping up their workload.

“These worries and challenges set women up for a self-fulfilling prophecy,” write the authors of the report. “When help is received, women take this as a sign that they can’t keep up any longer.”

These worries aren’t unfounded. The stigma of pregnancy in the workplace remains very much alive. Pregnant workers are often seen as a safety risk. There are also more insidious factors at play with how people respond to the pregnant body, and a belief, often unconscious, that a pregnant woman belongs in the home. Studies have shown that pregnant workers are viewed as less competent and dependable – and more caring and irrational – than women who are not visibly pregnant.

This prejudice has cost women promotions, or even their jobs.

“People still have a lot of stereotypes about whether mothers are good workers, and those come into play when women are pregnant,” said Emily Martin, general counsel and vice president for Workplace Justice at nonprofit National Women’s Law Center. “They may assume, without realizing they’re assuming, that once she gets pregnant, her job is not her priority and may treat her accordingly, and that’s discrimination.”

The study focused more on the informal interactions between pregnant women and their superiors and colleagues rather than company policies and support programs for women.

“That’s the part that’s harder for organizations because it requires companies to increase awareness of managers and colleagues about appropriate and inappropriate interactions,” said Clair. “It’s harder to track those kinds of behaviors.”

For instance, one of the study participants met with her manager to discuss her maternity leave and specified when she planned to return to work. Her boss responded by telling her to keep her plans loose because she couldn’t predict how she would feel when the baby arrives and starts to make heavy demand of her time and energy.

“Her boss was well-meaning, but he was projecting onto this woman and sending signals about how she was being viewed, creating an environment where she was starting to question herself and how people valued her,” said Clair.

It’s not an easy terrain for companies to navigate, said Clair. The study said businesses should instead design programs and management training that allow room for their pregnant workers to have more of a say in the kind of help they receive.

“What some women truly experience as supportive might be quite different from one person to the other, and these aren’t easily resolved tensions,” she said. “Organizations should appreciate the complexities and recognize that things we think are well meaning might have ill effects.”

The issue gets even more complex in industries where safety and liability are overriding concerns, said Greenfield, who is also the director of general obstetrics and gynaecology at University Hospitals Case Medical Center. But employers don’t have the legal right to decide whether a job is safe or not simply because a woman is pregnant, Martin noted. Rather, it’s up to the pregnant woman herself to assess the risk unless she has the potential to cause harm to people around her – which one could argue was the case with the airline pilot.

“Employers should not be assuming that women want changes on the job,” said Martin. “If an employer responds to a pregnancy by taking her off big accounts or assuming she doesn’t want to travel anymore, even if it’s motivated by some desire to help her, that’s a problem.”

While there isn’t research into the costs of retaining pregnant workers versus hiring new candidates, studies show that replacing a salaried employee can cost a business as much as 50% to 60% of the worker’s annual salary. The number increases the higher up the position, and replacing a top executive can cost a company 213% of annual salary.

Considering women make up nearly half of the workforce and more women are working while pregnant than they did 50 years ago, companies need to figure out the most effective ways to accommodate pregnant employees.

“If you can make an environment that supports women and help them ease back in, they’re going to be more loyal to your institution,” Greenfield said. “The bottom line is don’t make assumptions. Talk to the woman about what her needs are and be respectful.”

This time last week, the last thing Theresa May really fancied was a trade mission to India. All that travel, all those meetings spent not discussing Tata steel and coming to speculative decisions that would be entirely dependent on Britain’s not-yet-started Brexit negotiations. But after the embarrassment of last Thursday’s high court ruling that the government couldn’t invoke article 50 by royal prerogative, India looked a much more attractive destination. Let someone else take the flak.

With the justice minister, Liz Truss, having gone to ground after taking rather too long to realise that part of her job was to actually defend the independence of the judiciary – who would have guessed? – that person was the Brexit minister. As this was the third time in almost as many weeks that David Davis has been made to come to the house to try and fail to persuade MPs that the government really did know what it was doing, it was understandable that Grumpy was at his grumpiest.

“We want to bring back control of our laws to the UK,” he growled. Except for those ones which we don’t trust British judges to adjudicate on in the way we would like them to. Sovereignty has its limits apparently. “The government came to the conclusion that it was perfectly OK to invoke article 50 using prerogative powers,” he continued. Kindness prevented him from commenting on whether May had made a misjudgment of her own in appointing Jeremy Wright – a man described by former Tory MP, Stephen Phillips, as “a third-rate conveyancing lawyer” – as attorney general. “The court came to a different view and we are disappointed by that.”

Disappointment was the least of it. Fury, outrage and humiliation were more like it. But Grumpy was in no mood to back down. Having repeatedly told MPs that the result of the referendum must stand and there should be no going back, Grumpy sounded awfully like someone who was having a major sulk about not getting his way and was going to carry on fighting until he did. “We’re going to the supreme court, who we believe will tell us we are being proper and lawful,” he insisted. And if the supreme court let him down, he’d go to the supreme supreme court. And if that failed he’d just appoint some judges of his own. Job done.

Keir Starmer, Labour’s shadow Brexit minister, took a more measured tone. He’s in for the long haul and his doctor has told him to watch his blood pressure. “This is the third statement you’ve made and we are still none the wiser,” he observed. Grumpy had failed to condemn the Daily Mail and the Daily Telegraph for their attacks on the judges; he had failed to explain the government’s contingency plan in the event of it losing its appeal; he had failed, end of.

There was no way Grumpy was going to condemn the press – it’s always easier to overlook a bit of homophobia and racism when they’re coming from your own supporters, so he went back to his default setting. Anyone who tried to stop the government from doing exactly what it wanted was trying to thwart the will of the people and was therefore an enemy of the state. There could be no question of the government revealing its negotiating strategy – not least because it doesn’t have one – as it would undermine its already ropey position. The idea that the government has already given away a key bargaining position by declaring it will invoke article 50 before the end of March, doesn’t seem to have occurred to Grumpy.

MPs from both sides of the house invited the government to put forward a resolution to invoke article 50, in order to allow the house to prove its concerns on this issue were over parliamentary sovereignty and not to delay Britain’s exit from the EU. “No,” snapped Grumpy. “We’re going to go to the supreme court and that’s that.” Giving parliament any say in Brexit would be the thin end of the wedge. Give MPs an inch and they’ll take a mile.

Could Grumpy give any hint of what transitional arrangements might be made if, as everyone expects, the EU negotiations cannot be concluded within two years? No, he bloody well couldn’t. They were a secret which was his. The more reasonable the request, the grumpier Grumpy became. By the time the speaker concluded the session, a fuse had blown and Grumpy had become almost entirely monosyllabic. Yes and no. He wasn’t entirely sure which. But one of the two. Definitely, maybe.

Janet Reno, who has died aged 78, was the first woman attorney general of the US. Appointed by Bill Clinton in 1991, she served throughout his two terms of office, the second longest tenure in American history. It made her a figure of stability in a cabinet often in flux and frequently rocked by the steady stream of partisan attacks on both President Clinton and the first lady, Hillary Clinton, most notably the Whitewater investigation.

Never part of Clinton’s inner circle, Reno displayed great independence, and her courage to stand behind decisions she felt were right often left her vulnerable to critics from both sides of the political fence. Her controversial decisions included the assault on the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas; the return of the six-year-old Elián González to Cuba; the anti-monopoly prosecution of Microsoft and a racketeering lawsuit against the tobacco industry to recover the healthcare costs of treating smokers. Each time she would stand behind her actions publicly, often quoting Harry Truman’s “the buck stops here”.

Born in Miami, she was the daughter of two of the city’s journalists. Her father, born Henry Rasmussen, came to the US as a child from Denmark; his parents reportedly chose the more American name Reno from a map. He worked as a crime reporter on the Miami Herald for 43 years. Her mother, Jane Wood, was a reporter on the Miami News, and a naturalist famed locally for wrestling alligators. When Janet was eight and she and her three siblings moved to a home on the edge of the Everglades, her mother built their new house herself.

Janet was debate champion at Coral Gables high school and left Cornell University in 1960 with a degree in chemistry; commentators sometimes noted her almost scientific approach to both the law and to the facts of a case. She graduated from Harvard law school in 1963, one of only 16 women in her class, but when she returned to Miami she was turned down by the city’s most prestigious firm, Steel Hector & Davis. After opening her own firm, in 1971 she was appointed counsel to the Florida state house of representatives’ judicial committee and, in 1972, she lost in a race for a state house seat.

But she was offered a job by Richard Gerstein, the state attorney for Dade County, which includes Miami. She informed Gerstein that her father thought he was a crook; he replied that that was why she had been offered the job. Although she left the office briefly in 1976, when offered a partnership by the same firm who had rejected her 13 years earlier, she returned, and when Gerstein retired she was appointed to his job, a difficult one given Miami’s high crime rate and racial conflicts.

She prosecuted a number of high-profile child abuse cases where doubts over convictions led to changes in the ways such cases were handled. Most tellingly, she brought charges against five white policemen for beating a black insurance salesman to death. Their acquittal in 1980 (by a judge and jury in Tampa) sparked rioting in Miami during which 18 people died. Reno resisted calls for her resignation, instead working for improved relations with the black community.

Bill Clinton offered Reno the attorney general’s post after his first two choices, Zoë Baird and Kimba Wood, both withdrew because they had hired undocumented immigrants as nannies.

Before she had taken office in 1993, David Koresh and his Branch Davidian sect of the Seventh Day Adventist church began a showdown against federal agents seeking to search their Waco compound for illegal weapons. Ten people, including four agents from the ATF, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, were killed when they tried to serve a warrant in Feburary. In April, Reno ordered a full-scale assault on the compound in which Koresh and 75 other people, many of them children, died. She was criticised fiercely by the right, for murdering American “patriots”, and by the left for claiming she feared children were being abused by the Davidians. Reno took full responsibility; in 2004 she said that “the tragedy is we will never know what was the right thing to do”.

In 1994 Reno appointed a special prosecutor, the Republican Robert B Fiske, to investigate the Clintons’ real estate deal known as Whitewater, but Fiske was viewed by the right as too bipartisan, and Congress empowered an independent counsel, George HW Bush’s former solicitor general Kenneth Starr, to replace him. Starr’s investigations ran for five years, resulting in the impeachment and acquittal of Bill Clinton for lying about his sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky. In the middle of Whitewater, Reno refused to appoint another prosecutor to investigate the Clintons’ campaign financing, saying the was no evidence to justify such calls.

Her efforts against Big Tobacco ran head on into powerful voices in Congress funded by the industry in the states they represented. In 1998 she pursued the suit against Microsoft despite critics who claimed the issues were “too complicated” for juries to understand.

But her political legacy was again sealed by a raid, in the case of González, the Cuban boy found in an inner tube off the coast of Florida after his mother was one of 10 people who drowned when the small boat in which they left Cuba sank. González’s relatives in Miami refused to send him back to his father (from whom his mother was divorced) in Cuba. The boy, who later said he had wanted to return, became a political football, until the family refused to follow a court order, and Reno ordered a pre-dawn raid on their house in which Elián was seized and returned to his father. The attorney general who believed so strongly in the facts and the law was again left with no option but the use of governmental force.

Over six feet tall and resolutely lacking glamour, Reno was a figure of cruel abuse on rightwing talk radio, and a somewhat gentler satire on Saturday Night Live, where Will Ferrell’s skits of “Janet Reno’s Dance Party” were a running gag. After leaving office in 2001, Reno showed a more relaxed side to her character by appearing on the show alongside Ferrell.

In 2002, Reno mounted a challenge to Florida’s Republican governor, Jeb Bush, but she lost the Democratic primary to Bill McBride.

Reno had been diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease in 1995. In later years she served on numerous boards, including that of The Innocence Project, and devoted herself to her extended family.

She is survived by her sister Maggy. Loretta Lynch, the second woman to serve as US attorney general praised Reno, saying “She was guided by one simple test, to do what the law and the facts required... regardless of which way the political winds were blowing.”

Prime minister repeatedly attacked Labour for signing up to EU social chapter that includes part-time workers’ directive
###########################################################
Last week was not a good week for the government. On Thursday the high court ruled that the prime minister was acting unlawfully in seeking to use prerogative powers to invoke article 50, and reminded her that only parliament can make or repeal laws. The court also reminded Theresa May that when it comes to legislation, parliament is sovereign.

Then on Friday, Stephen Phillips – a Conservative MP and a leave campaigner – resigned, citing “irreconcilable differences” with the prime minister’s approach to Brexit, in particular her desire to sideline parliament and avoid scrutiny. So much for building a national consensus on Brexit.

This matters because the decisions to be taken in the coming months and years on the UK’s future relationship with the EU are the most important for a generation. That is why they need to be properly considered and debated. As Labour has repeatedly argued, that means the government putting before parliament the basic terms it wants to achieve from Brexit negotiations.

Yet after another statement from Brexit secretary David Davis on Monday, we are none the wiser about what the government’s approach will be or the basic terms it will seek to achieve. We still do not know the government’s stance on the single market, on the customs union, or on cooperation with our EU partners in combating serious crime and terrorism. We do not know if the government has a plan for transitional arrangements in March 2019, or if special consideration will be given to the situations in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. We don’t even know how the government will proceed if the supreme court upholds the high court’s ruling.

Of course, the government should not reveal the detail of its negotiating hand or provide a running commentary. But these are basic questions, and they deserve clear answers. Instead, ministers have approached this crucial task in entirely the wrong way, sowing discord where there could be harmony.

In the last week that approach has further unravelled, and in a particularly ugly way.

In the aftermath of the high court judgment, there have been appalling personal attacks on the judges involved and the judiciary in general, including the suggestion that they are “enemies of the people”. Having worked in countries where judges do as the executive tells them, I know how corrosive this can be. The independence of the judiciary should be a prized part of our democracy, not something to be threatened when the governing party disagrees with a verdict.

Our judges were asked one simple question last week: is the prime minister acting lawfully? Having listened to argument from both sides, they concluded that she was not. They upheld the law and protected parliamentary sovereignty.

Robust comment on and criticism of court judgments is right in a country that respects free speech. But we all have a duty to stand up for the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary. Many people, myself included, think the lord chancellor has been far too slow and too reluctant to do so.

The one aspect of Davis’s statement that was clear was that ministers intend to appeal the high court’s ruling to the supreme court. They are, of course, perfectly entitled to do so. But would it not be better for the government to stand back and ask whether the national interest is really served by spending the next month fighting a high court ruling, while providing no further clarity or accountability on the basic terms of Brexit?

The government, however, seems determined to carry on down the same path, adamantly insisting that the executive alone should have the right to trigger our exit from the EU. I have repeatedly made it clear that Labour accepts and respects the outcome of the referendum: there is a mandate to leave and Labour will not frustrate it by voting down article 50. But there is no mandate for the terms upon which we exit, and the stakes are too high for the prime minister to decide this by herself.

That is why the government should come clean and put the basic terms of its Brexit plan before the Commons, allowing scrutiny, transparency and challenge. Those are – along with judicial independence – central tenets of our democracy. They are also far more likely to lead to the right outcome for all of us and for generations to come.

The belated response of the lord chancellor to the shameful attacks on three senior judges by the Mail, Express and Telegraph (Report, 7 November) was the bare minimum required of her by the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 and by her oath of office: to “defend the independence of the judiciary”. It fell far short of the forceful condemnation which she should have delivered to those who seek to undermine the crucial role of the judges as guardians of our democracy against the abuse of executive power.

The fault originates in the 2005 act itself, which robbed the office of lord chancellor of its stature at the head of the judiciary with the added authority of a cabinet minister. By relegating the office to a purely nominal adjunct to the political function of justice secretary, Tony Blair’s government (against the advice of his mentor Lord Irvine) paved the way for a succession of inadequately qualified appointees. Public appreciation of the vital role of the judges in protecting the rule of law has been diminished. This is especially sad at a time when the judiciary is probably as able and impartial as it has ever been.

• In his compelling book The Rule of Law, the late Lord Bingham concluded his justification of the role of the judiciary in exercising power to hold ministers, officials and public bodies to account with this reflection: “There are countries in the world where all judicial decisions find favour with the powers that be, but they are probably not places where any of us would wish to live.”

• “We need leaders who better understand the rule of law”. This was written by Martin Kettle in the Guardian 10 years ago, 25 November 2006, and quoted by Tom Bingham in his excellent book The Rule of Law (2010). Maybe it should be compulsory reading for all MPs. The lord chancellor might find it particularly helpful.

• Neither your news reports nor letters from readers have made mention of perhaps the most relevant text on the referendum. This is a clear statement by government on parliament’s role, found in the “Government response to the report on Referendums in the United Kingdom”, comprising a report by the House of Lords select committee on the constitution (HL Paper 99), published on 30 September 2010, replying to the committee report issued on 7 April that year.

In a letter to the committee, Mark Harper MP wrote: “I welcome the report … and, given the profile and importance of the subject, the government has considered its response carefully in light of the recent introduction of the parliamentary voting system and constituencies bill.”

In its substantive response to recommendations the government asserted: “Under the UK’s constitutional arrangements parliament must be responsible for deciding whether or not to take action in response to a referendum result.”

Yet Downing Street’s response to the high court judgment was to say: “The government is disappointed by the court’s judgment. The country voted to leave the European Union in a referendum approved by act of parliament. And the government is determined to respect the result of the referendum. We will appeal this judgment.”

• Four centuries ago England was engaged in civil war to wrest power from an autocratic king and place it in the hands of parliament. Having been arrested, Charles I was indicted in 1649, offered every opportunity to formulate a defence which he refused (as he believed himself to be above the authority of the courts), tried and found guilty of treason; the punishment for which was execution. He was not assassinated but convicted by due process.

England thus began the road to the first modern democracy, whereby the rule of law, as established by the principle of the separation of powers: the executive, parliament and the judiciary, was to prevail in the interests of protecting all citizens; a model to follow by all aspiring democracies.

England had no bloodthirsty French-style revolution. No Napoleon, Hitler or Mussolini arose in this land. Nor has extra-parliamentary action ever found traction since. To observe the country’s institutions degenerate into the tyranny of mob rule, whereby Brexiters who won a referendum by 4% feel emboldened to abuse with impunity all that disagree with them, is the most unedifying spectacle one is likely to have witnessed in this country, and profoundly disturbing.

• The ministerial rhetoric around Brexit is extraordinary and needs to be challenged. According to Boris Johnson, speaking in Berlin, “The will of the British people was expressed very clearly” (Report, 5 November). David Davis even said that it was the largest mandate in history because more than 17 million people voted leave. What nonsense, when over 16 million voted the other way!

Not only was the referendum purely advisory, but the majority was extremely narrow compared with the two previous UK-wide referendums, about staying in the EEC in 1975 and whether to adopt the alternative vote in 2011 – both of which produced huge two-thirds majorities in favour of the winning side. The international human rights lawyer Geoffrey Robertson pointed out in these pages that many countries which have referendums don’t allow change by simple majority. In some a proposal must pass by what Robertson rightly called a “very clear” majority such as two-thirds (Opinion, 28 June). Johnson’s “very clearly” is a gross exaggeration, as are similar statements by other ministers.An attempt is being made to write the narrowness of the result out of history. It must be resisted.

• Nigel Farage’s words on Sunday’s Andrew Marr programme came dangerously near to incitement to riot. His subsequent decision to lead a march on the supreme court must be seen as an attempt to intimidate our judges. Sadly we are now seeing a rapid and disturbing shift in the centre of gravity of British politics. Mainstream MPs who, until recently, would have fought shy of criticising normal court processes now seem to find it very easy to do so. The prime minister and lord chancellor who, again until recently, would have spoken out clearly and loudly against the kind of press headlines we have seen now seem, for whatever reason, unwilling to do so. For liberals and democrats these are disturbing times.

David Davis has confirmed that the government may have to wait until January for a supreme court ruling on whether it can press ahead with the formal process of exiting the EU without a parliamentary vote.

The Brexit secretary told the House of Commons that the supreme court would hear the government’s appeal against last week’s high court decision early next month; but a judgment might not come until the new year.

Asked by Labour’s Angela Smith MP whether it could be January before a judgment is handed down, Davis said: “Yes, she is right in one respect, that it may come as late as early January. The expectation is that the case will be heard in the early part of December, and it will take two or three weeks I expect to get the judgment written up. But I think it is the proper role of government to wait and respect the judgment we get from the supreme court, full stop.”

A January ruling would leave a tight timetable for the government to win a parliamentary vote – particularly if, as Davis had previously suggested, it means passing a bill through both houses.

In a robust statement delivered in the Commons in response to last week’s judgment, Davis insisted Theresa May would stick to her timetable of invoking article 50 before the end of March. He also reiterated that the government was determined not to allow its hands to be tied by revealing too much about its negotiating strategy to MPs.

“Parliamentary scrutiny, yes; telling the prime minister which cards to play, seeking to force her to disclose her hand to those she will be negotiating with, no,” Davis said.

He accused politicians including Nick Clegg and Owen Smith, who have said they will seek to amend any legislation triggering article 50, of trying to scupper Brexit, saying: “The whole approach is designed to wreck the negotiations.”

Davis was responding to the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, who had claimed the government’s strategy, which was based on triggering article 50 without recourse to parliament, was coming unstuck.

“The government has approached its task in the wrong way, and its approach is now unravelling, and I’m afraid to say it’s now unravelling in the most divisive and ugly way,” Starmer said.

Starmer called for the government to disclose its position on a series of issues, including whether it wanted to remain within the customs union; and how it would maintain cooperation on security issues with the rest of the EU.

Davis said the government had already set out some principles of its approach, including control of laws, control of borders, and the “freest possible” trade in goods and services with the EU and elsewhere.

He said parliament would have ample opportunities to debate Brexit, including as MPs pass a planned great repeal bill next year. But he insisted it would be unhelpful to give more details of the government’s negotiating stance, and MPs and peers could not dictate the talks with the rest of the EU.

“We won’t achieve a good negotiation outcome if this is a negotiation being run by 650 people in this House of Commons, or nearly 900 in the other place. No negotiation in history has been run that way,” he said.

“If parliament insists on setting out a detailed minimum negotiating position, that will quickly become the maximum possible offer from our negotiating partners.”

Davis said the government still believed a parliamentary vote was unnecessary, and would take that argument to the supreme court. “We believe it is proper and lawful for the government to trigger article 50 by prerogative powers,” he said.

The Brexit secretary defended the independence of the judiciary in the face of the vehement backlash of the past few days; and criticised attacks on Gina Miller, who brought the case. “I can’t find words strong enough frankly to say how much I detest the attacks on her,” Davis said.

”And frankly from what I’ve heard about them – I haven’t seen them myself directly but from what I’ve heard about them – they sound to me to be effectively criminal attacks, because incitement of violence, threats of violence, racial abuse, are all crimes.”

On Monday, Miller spoke out against abusive messages she had received since launching the case, which she said included “the encouragement of sexual violence, physical violence and death threats”. 



“I’m absolutely appalled because I think it’s a reflection of – as I’ve called it – the dark clouds gathering over the UK and it’s incredibly worrying that that’s a place we appear to be in,” she told the Press Association. “I think the belittling of me as an individual is definitely connected to me being a woman and a woman of colour.”

Miller said she was disappointed by the government’s decision to appeal against the high court decision, which she said was handed down by “three of the most respected … successful, independent judges in the country”.

She added: “I never thought I’d hear a British prime minister say that she was supreme and above the judges, I mean that is beyond anything I ever thought I’d hear the British prime minister say, and to me it confirms exactly why this case is so important.”

On Saturday, under heavy pressure to break her silence and meet her statutory obligations, the lord chancellor Liz Truss defended the independence of the judiciary, saying it is the “foundation upon which our rule of law is built”.

That did not go far enough, the former lord chief justice, Lord Judge has said. “The lord chancellor has a statutory obligation to do it. That is one of her functions, to defend the judiciary.

“And it was a little too late and not a lot. To say you believe in independence of judges is fine but it doesn’t actually address why this matters at a particular time,” he told the BBC’s Newsnight programme.

Lord Judge added that a planned march to be led by Nigel Farage on the day the supreme court hears the article 50 case poses a danger to the integrity of Britain’s institutions.



“I don’t think it makes any difference to the judicial decision but it does make a difference to public order. Let’s say, for the sake of argument, the supreme court decides the high court was wrong. It will undoubtedly be conveyed as a victory for the demonstrators. It won’t be, but that’s what will be conveyed. And if that is conveyed you’ve undermined the administration of justice.”

The supreme court is still awaiting a formal submission from the government’s lawyers setting out its application to appeal against the high court ruling.



On Monday, the Brexit referendum campaign chief Michael Gove said he backed the high court judges who had come under fire from some segments of the media. The former justice secretary said: “The high court judges who’ve ruled on article 50 are brilliant, thoughtful, wise and decent men – their judgment deserves respect.”

On Tuesday a court in Belfast will hear a separate application from Northern Ireland claimants who want to combine their challenge with the supreme court case. The Belfast claimants still have to obtain permission for their case to “leapfrog” over the appeal court stage directly to the supreme court.



Because the case raises so many issues about the relative powers of ministers and parliament, as many as 11 justices – an unprecedented number – are expected to sit on the supreme court panel. The case is provisionally scheduled for 7 and 8 December, but additional days may yet be added.

The attorney general, Jeremy Wright QC, will again lead the government’s legal team in the article 50 hearing.

Later on Monday in the Commons the business secretary, Greg Clark, opened a separate debate on workers’ rights after Brexit. Clark pledged that all rights Britain’s workers currently enjoy because of EU membership would be protected and incorporated into UK law as part of the government’s great repeal bill.

“No one listening to this debate should think that we have any intention of eroding the rights that we enjoy in this country through our process of leaving the European Union, because in fact the opposite is true,” he said. “We will be using the legislation before this house to entrench all existing workers’ rights in British law, whatever the future relationship that the UK has with the EU.”

Protecting existing workers’ rights after exiting the EU was one of the key “red lines” Labour set out for assessing the government’s approach to Brexit.

It feels like a lifetime ago that the US presidential candidates launched their campaigns to become the Democrat and Republican nominees. The twists, turns, scandals and shocks of the race to the White House have provided the backing track to our own tumultuous politics ever since. Now, with votes being cast and the polls tighter than ever, the heavyweights of British journalism are landing in Washington, ready to provide wall-to-wall coverage of the final days, the result – and the fallout.

When huge stories are breaking like tidal waves elsewhere, it’s always worth keeping one eye on what’s happening on home shores. Just look at Brexit. While we were distracted by the referendum result, the government quietly revealed it had spent £600,000 trying to prevent legal action being brought against it over allegations that British intelligence was complicit in torture. And sure enough, on America’s polling day, our House of Lords will debate one of the most reckless and undemocratic proposals to make its way through parliament in years.

A little-noticed amendment to the children and social work bill will allow councils to opt out of their child protection obligations under almost every law covering children’s social care since 1933. If a local authority is struggling with a tight budget and feels expensive social care should be next for the chop it could – even if it is already failing the children under its care – ask the education minister to let it ignore 80 years of legislation.

The reason for this destruction of children’s rights? “To test different ways of working with a view to achieving better outcomes … or achieving the same outcomes more efficiently.” If the Lords were debating this on any other day it would receive the media scrutiny and public debate that such a morally dubious and profoundly risky proposal deserves.

This isn’t about reducing red tape or doing away with bureaucracy. This is a bonfire of carefully considered policy, the product of decades of thorough research, parliamentary scrutiny, public consultation and some of it the legacy of appalling cases of child abuse and neglect, like the death of Baby P.

A duty to investigate when a child is suffering significant harm, a requirement to provide children in need with day care and a ban on profit-making companies running child protection services are just some of the laws we stand to lose. Every social care service that children receive from local authorities – from child protection and the care system to support for disabled children and young people in custody – would be affected.

When councils apply for exemption, the decision will be made by the education minister alone. There will be no need for full parliamentary scrutiny, expert input, or consultation with families, social workers and the children and young people who will be most affected. Exemptions would last for up to three years, and could then be extended for another three – so children born next year could be deprived of any support from the state, no matter how badly they need it, until they are six years old. The plan would create the cruellest of postcode lotteries: a child in one town could find herself with fewer rights to care and support than her cousin in the next town.

The coalition of those expressing their outrage is diverse – and it’s growing. More than 100,000 people have signed a petition, and Liberty has united with 40 organisations and social care experts calling for the plans to be dropped. A recent survey of almost 3,000 social workers by public services union Unison found that just one in 10 thinks local authorities should be able to exempt themselves from children’s social care legislation. More than two-thirds are against the idea – and almost 70% believe it will put more children at risk.

Making children’s rights an optional extra might sound cruel and unusual, but sadly it seems nothing is safe with a government that boasts of plans to scrap our Human Rights Act and is proud of turning our country into a “hostile environment” for migrants.

This American election is a moment in history none of us should ignore. But we mustn’t allow the rights of our children to vanish in its wake. So keep an eye on the House of Lords as America goes to the polls tomorrow. Sign the petition. Spread the word. Our government needs to learn that public scrutiny never rests, and that no matter what is happening elsewhere, attacks on the rights of the most vulnerable will always be newsworthy.

It wasn’t the doomy medical diagnosis that caused F Scott Fitzgerald’s mental breakdown. It was moment the doctors told him he was going to be OK. “After about an hour of solitary pillow-hugging,” wrote the novelist in 1936, “I began to realize that for two years my life had been a drawing on resources that I did not possess, that I had been mortgaging myself physically and spiritually up to the hilt.”

Come the day of the supreme-court judgment on Brexit, the progressive part of Britain could be forgiven if it succumbed to a Fitzgerald-style “crack-up”. Nigel Farage will mobilise 100,000 racists and xenophobes to intimidate the court; the justices will probably ignore them and uphold the high-court verdict. But it is beginning to feel as if liberal democracy in Britain is, too, “drawing on resources it does not possess”.

Across the world, a succession of near-catastrophes has over the past two years begun to drain progressive politics of its resilience. Anti-racists, globalists and believers in the virtues of science over mumbo-jumbo are still winning elections. But the effort is going to exhaust us unless we become more radical.

In America, whether he wins or loses, Donald Trump’s candidacy – by sidelining the respectable right and creating a mass movement based on hate – has eroded American democracy to a new and fragile baseline. All the right needs to do in 2020 is to find a more respectable candidate and, until then, unleash a resistance struggle against the legitimacy of Clinton, her supreme court appointments and any Democratic majority in Congress that emerges.

It’s important to understand the new cross-fertilisation that has begun between Trump’s white-supremacist revolt and the revolt being planned by Ukip. Virtually nobody in mainstream politics a decade ago used the term “white working class”. Now it’s common to hear even BBC presenters parrot the phrase, as if the separation between white and non-white populations in Britain’s post-industrial towns were an accomplished fact, not a far-right fantasy.

In Britain, since the high-court decision, and with the tabloids ramping up their attack on the judiciary, people have been asking: what do Jonathan Harmsworth, owner of the Daily Mail, and Rupert Murdoch want? What would make them stop?

The answer is: they want Britain ruled by a xenophobic mob, controlled by them. The policies are secondary – as long as their legal offshore tax-dodging facilities are maintained. They also want a Labour party they can control and a Tory party they can intimidate.

In pursuit of that, they have created what the sociologist Manuel Castells calls a “switch”. You create a constituency of angry rightwing voters, assembled around using language no respectable politician could utter, and you switch them on, or off, against the government of the day as long as that government does your bidding.

It’s facile to call Trump and Farage “fascists”. They are elite, rightwing economic nationalists who have each stumbled upon the fact that a minority of working-class people can be fooled by populism – especially when the left refuses to play the populist game. And they are moving forward fast.

So we need to catch up. “We” is no longer about leave versus remain, still less Corbynistas versus the rest. “We” should include everybody who wants this country to be run by parliament, with the judiciary guaranteeing the rule of law, to remain engaged with the multilateral, global institutions and be tolerant to migrants and foreign visitors.

The first thing we have to make is a rhetorical break with neoliberalism: the doctrine of austerity, inequality, privatisation, financial corruption, asset bubbles and technocratic hubris. It is entirely possible to construct a humane pro-business version of capitalism without these things.

There doesn’t have to be a bunch of apologies and confessions. You could assuage a large part of the anger that’s driving the ultra-right simply by a demonstrable change of path: pump money into communities and hope will follow. Likewise, get HMRC on to the case of the tax-dodging rich, and off the backs of small-business owners.

The next thing is to do something radical about the inequality of voice in Britain’s media. Enact Leveson. Ask companies such as British Airways why they are distributing the Mail mid-Atlantic, for free, as a kind of “unwelcome to Britain” card for visitors. People with resources should set up – or, even better, acquire through hostile takeover – mass-circulation newspapers that champion democratic values, tolerance and restraint. Plus we need to challenge supine editorial leadership of the BBC. There are no minutes of a meeting where the BBC’s bosses decided to give free rein to hate speech and intimidation on programmes such as Question Time; no instructions exist that say reporters should run unchallenged vox-pops with racists, back to back. But this is what’s happening. It would take one email from the director general, Tony Hall, to stop it.

The philosopher Walter Benjamin wrote in the 1930s that the success of the radical right was fuelled by the failure of the radical left. Benjamin took it as read that the business class would either support, or flip over to, fascism once the demagogues had created a street movement and an atmosphere of crisis.

Today, however, the vast majority of business leaders, professionals and educated people operate in a world regulated to global standards, where markets depend on freedom and the rule of law. Today, therefore, it is the failure of the radical centre that’s the problem. It needs, like Fitzgerald after his famous “crack-up” to recharge its batteries.

If Nigel Farage leads 100,000 people to intimidate the supreme court, I intend to be on the other side of a police crash barrier opposing him. I don’t want to be flanked by only my anti-fascist mates from 30 years ago: I want to see an alliance of the left and the radical centre on the streets. That means bond traders from Canary Wharf, arm in arm with placard-carrying Trots. Masked-up Kurdish radicals alongside Mumsnet posters. Eighty years on from Cable Street, we don’t have many dockers and miners around, to help face down rightwing intimidation. Puny as we are, it’s up to us.

African nations are seeking to suspend the work of the first UN independent expert charged with investigating violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.

Botswana’s ambassador to the UN, Charles Ntwaagae, said on Friday that African nations want the general assembly to delay consideration of a Human Rights Council resolution adopted on 30 June that authorised the appointment of an expert to monitor LGBT rights to discuss “the legality of the creation of this mandate”.

Ntwaagae told the 193-member world body that a general assembly resolution introduced by African nations seeking a delay also calls for suspending the activities of the first expert, Vitit Muntarbhorn, from Thailand, who was appointed in September, pending a determination of the legality.

The assembly is expected to vote on the African resolution on Tuesday.

The Human Rights Council resolution establishing the LGBT expert was adopted by a vote of 23-18 with six abstentions, reflecting the deep divisions internationally on gay rights.

The UN has worked to improve the rights of the LGBT community in recent years but has repeatedly run into opposition from some member states, especially from countries in the Middle East and Africa as well as China and Russia. According to a UN human rights report last year, at least 76 countries retain laws used to criminalise and harass people on the basis of their sexual orientation and gender identity or expression, including laws criminalising consensual same-sex relationships among adults.

Ntwaagae said African nations “are alarmed” that the Human Rights Council is delving into national matters and attempting to focus on people “on the grounds of their sexual interests and behaviours, while ignoring that intolerance and discrimination regrettably exist in various parts of the world, be it on the basis of colour, race, sex or religion, to mention only a few”.

African nations are also concerned that sexual orientation and gender identity are being given attention “to the detriment of issues of paramount importance such as the right to development and the racism agenda”, he said.

Ntwaagae said African countries want to stress that sexual orientation and gender identity “are not and should not be linked to existing international human rights instruments”.



Muntarbhorn, a law professor who has been on the council’s Commission of Inquiry on Syria and previously served as UN special investigator on North Korea and on child prostitution and child pornography, was given a wide mandate by the Human Rights Council for three years.



It includes looking at ways to overcome violence and discrimination against people on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity, addressing the root causes, and working with states to protect lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.

The US deputy ambassador, Sarah Mendelson, expressed concern at the African resolution, telling the assembly that the Human Rights Council has approved numerous resolutions on people experiencing violence and discrimination, including those belonging to minority groups.

Mendelson said the African measure would have the general assembly reopen a Human Rights Council mandate for the first time and could undermine the council’s ability to function.

She urged the assembly to support an amendment expected to be introduced by Latin American and Caribbean nations that would remove the African call to delay the Human Rights Council resolution and suspend Muntarbhorn.

Francesca Cardona, speaking on behalf of the European Union, stressed that countries must “protect the human rights of all individuals without distinction of any kind”.

She said any attempt to call into question the legitimacy of the council resolution establishing the independent expert to protect against violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity “has no legal foundation”.

LGBT rights programme manager at the International Service of Human Rights (ISHR), Pooja Patel, said: “This move is harmful to non-violence and anti-discrimination efforts in relation to lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans people around the world. It will also entrench an ugly precedent whereby the [social, humanitarian and cultural] committee could effectively reverse any decision by the Human Rights Council, completely undermining its integrity and independence.”

The co-director of ISHR’s New York office, Eleanor Openshaw, said there were no grounds on which to question the legality of the expert’s mandate. “The legal validity of this expert position is rooted in principles of non-discrimination and universality of human rights as enshrined in the Universal Declaration on Human Rights. It is very much in line with the council’s responsibility and obligation, as articulated in its founding documents, to promote the universal protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all.”

The attorney general, Jeremy Wright QC, has defended the judges in the Brexit case – even though he disagrees with their ruling.

Speaking at a breakfast meeting at the Law Society in London, the MP for Kenilworth and Southam, who is leading the government’s legal team, promised that ministers would uphold the rule of law.

Wright’s statement comes after vituperative media coverage by the Daily Mail and other newspapers, which labelled the three judges in the high court article 50 case “enemies of the people”.

On Thursday, the lord chief justice, Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd, the master of the rolls, Sir Terence Etherton, and Lord Justice Sales ruled that only parliament had the power to trigger article 50 of the treaty of European Union initiating the UK’s withdrawal from the EU.

Addressing a meeting on pro bono legal work, Wright said: “The claimants in this and every other case are entitled to bring their case and to have it heard by the court and are entitled to do so without being harassed or intimidated. The judges in this case are entitled to decide this case in any way they choose in accordance with their judgment.

“I’m sure they would accept they are unlikely to decide so without criticism. But the principles [of the rule of law] remain critical in cases as big and fundamental as this one.

“I can and do defend those principles at the same time that I disagree respectfully with the court. But the good news is that there’s a mechanism to allow those who disagree. It’s called an appeal and we will make use of that mechanism.”

Wright said the government would respect the ultimate judgment of the supreme court when it hears the article 50 case next month.

“That is what the rule of law requires: that however big the case may be, the rule of law matters more.”

Wright’s comment came as the Ukip leader, Nigel Farage, said he was planning to lead a 100,000-strong march to the supreme court on the day it hears the Brexit appeal.



The most senior human rights official in Europe, Nils Muižnieks, added his voice on Monday to calls for the government to deliver a “stronger message” in defence of the high court judges.

Muižnieks, who is the commissioner for human rights at the Council of Europe, which oversees the European court of human rights, expressed his concern about the “political and media reaction” to last Thursday’s judgment.



“These were blatant attacks on the independence of the judiciary designed to stir up popular hatred, not just against the so-called ‘enemies of the people’ but also those who brought the claim to the courts,” he said.

“The spike in hate crimes immediately after the UK’s referendum on EU membership and the climate of hostility to non-nationals can be linked to the hate speech targeting migrants in some parts of the UK press and by certain leading politicians long before and in the run-up to the referendum. Words matter as they are often the first step towards actual violence.

“This is why political leaders have a duty to stand up to those sectors of the media that are stirring up hatred. A stronger message is now needed from the UK government which clearly condemns the personal attacks on the judges and the targeting of those individuals who brought the challenge to the courts.”

Pressure on the justice secretary, Liz Truss, to condemn the media’s coverage continues despite her belatedly issuing a statement on Saturday reasserting the importance of the courts.

Truss said: “The independence of the judiciary is the foundation upon which our rule of law is built and our judiciary is rightly respected the world over for its independence and impartiality. In relation to the case heard in the high court, the government has made it clear it will appeal to the supreme court. Legal process must be followed.”

The chair of the Bar Council of England and Wales, Chantal-Aimée Doerries QC, said she was disappointed that Truss, who is both justice secretary and lord chancellor, had not gone further in condemning the attacks.

The Bar Council also passed a resolution regretting the “serious and unjustified attacks on the judiciary arising out of the article 50 litigation” and calling on Truss, who is responsible for defending the independence of the judiciary, to speak out.

The Law Society president, Robert Bourns, said on Monday: “Attacks on the judges simply because they were doing their jobs does our country no credit, and government ministers must be unequivocal in their support for the rule of law even if they disagree with the judgment.

“It is part of the role of lawyers to defend unpopular causes and there has been an increasing narrative in recent months that seeks to conflate the jobs solicitors and barristers do with the causes they represent as part of our system of justice. The extension of this to disparaging and criticising judges is dangerous and damaging.”

Francis FitzGibbon QC, chairman of the Criminal Bar Association, said: “Neither the lord chancellor nor the prime minister have done what they ought to do, and unreservedly condemn both the calling of judges ‘enemies of the people’, the demands for their dismissal, and the making of their blameless personal lives into objects of reproach.



“Standing by and saying nothing may not be meant as such, but is likely to be seen as tacit approval for what has gone on, and encouragement for more of the same. In these disturbed times, dignified silence doesn’t work because there are too many people who will see it as a green light.”

Over the weekend, the health minister, Jeremy Hunt, who appeared on BBC1’s The Andrew Marr Show, defended the right of newspapers to criticise the judges involved in the high court ruling.

“There are plenty of times when I haven’t liked the tone of the Daily Mail, there are plenty of times I don’t like the tone of the BBC but that is democracy,” he said. “I would defend to the hilt the right of newspapers within the law to write what they like and to criticise politicians.”

Dominic Raab, a former justice minister and prominent Brexit campaigner, told the Daily Telegraph: “This is a hugely contentious ruling bound to provoke criticism and debate. Our judges are robust, not some precious shrinking violets. Frankly, the Bar Council sound like they want to gag debate, which is hardly democratic. All sides need a greater sense of perspective.”

The Sunday Times claimed that four of the justices on the supreme court panel expected to hear the appeal “had links to the EU” – in some cases referring to their involvement with the European court of human rights, which is not part of the European Union.

Conor Gearty, a professor of human rights law at the London School of Economics, retweeted pictures of the Daily Mail’s ‘enemies of the people’ front page and noted its similarities to a 1933 German newspaper that used the same phrase to refer to the need for judges to “get out of the way of the German people’s will”.

After last week’s high court Brexit ruling, bookies have slashed the odds of a general election next year. The logic behind this is that such a move would give Theresa May a mandate she currently lacks to press ahead with article 50 on her own terms. Without it – now the judges have decided parliament must give its assent before the government can formally trigger Brexit – she potentially faces months of delaying tactics by MPs who backed remain and who outnumber leavers in parliament.

With the Conservatives currently on average 14 percentage points ahead of Labour in the polls, there is a clear incentive for May to go to the people; at 43%, the Tories’ current average rating is as much as nine points above where it was shortly before the EU referendum on 23 June. An early election would seem to give May every opportunity to increase her personal authority and that of her government.

But perhaps it is time to stand back. Would an election early next year (assuming the obstacles to such a ballot created by the Fixed-term Parliaments Act could be overcome) necessarily make it significantly easier for May to secure parliament’s support for her approach to Brexit?

For a start, we should remember that it is quite difficult for any party to win an overall majority these days. Scotland is now largely barren territory for the Conservatives and Labour, and there is little sign that the electoral tide that enabled the SNP almost to sweep the board there in May 2015 has significantly receded. A majority has to be forged from within England and Wales alone.

Indeed, it took a seven-point lead over Labour just to deliver the Conservatives’ narrow 12-seat Commons majority last year. Even the 14-point lead May now has could still produce no more than a 76-seat majority – more than comfortable, it is true, but well short of a landslide.

There is, though, no guarantee that the current lead will be sustained through to next year. Part of it is down to the prime minister’s honeymoon. All honeymoons eventually come to an end.

Meanwhile, of course, the reason the government’s 12-seat majority is seen as too small is because of the continuing divisions on Europe inside the Conservative party. At present these divisions are being glossed over by the glue of ambiguity. But May could not call an election about Brexit without being more specific about what she thinks Brexit should mean. Consequently, the fissures inside the Conservative party could become exposed to public view. And divided governments are not an electorally attractive sight – even if they are facing a divided opposition.

Moreover, those differences over Europe are also evident among Conservative voters. Much of the Conservative advance in the polls since May became prime minister has come at the expense of Ukip. Although Labour support has dropped a couple of points since June, Ukip support is down by five points. Around one in five of those who voted Ukip in May 2015 now say they would back the Conservatives, three times as many as in June.

If these ex-Ukip voters gain the impression that May is not on course to deliver the kind of Brexit they want, they may well switch back to Ukip. True, Ukip has leadership problems of its own. But nothing would seem better designed to heal some of its wounds than an opportunity to fight an election in which Europe is the central issue.

At the same time, May has to bear in mind that at least one in three of those who currently say they support the Conservatives voted in June to remain in the EU. They could take fright if they come to fear the prime minister wants a hard Brexit.

Of course, these pro-remain Conservatives might feel Labour is an unattractive alternative. However, the relatively strong Liberal Democrat performance in recent local byelections as well as in the Witney parliamentary contest suggests that, in traditional Lib Dem areas at least, voters are beginning to put aside their disapproval of the party’s record in the coalition. So May could have trouble defending those gains from the Liberal Democrats that were vital to David Cameron’s success last year.

So long as Labour is weak in the polls, the prospect of an early election is always going to appear tempting in Tory eyes. However, May could end up with a markedly less successful outcome than current polling suggests. But, of course, if she does find herself suffering significant defeats in parliament, she may not have much choice.

Earlier this year, the departing chief inspector of prisons, Nick Hardwick, described the former justice minister Chris Grayling’s attempts to interfere with his conclusion that overcrowding and a shortage of staff were contributing to worsening standards across the prison estate. In September, a report by Hardwick’s successor Peter Clarke on an inspection of Bedford prison said that standards there were “unacceptable” and fell short of “basic levels of decency”, partly because of staffing shortages. Last week, the head of the Prison Officers Association (POA), Mike Rolfe, said that staff across the country were on their knees, and that prisons were succumbing to a “bloodbath”. Last night, 200 prisoners were involved in a riot in Bedford prison that took more than six hours to get under control. Whatever else anyone thinks about Sunday’s disturbances, no one can say that they weren’t warned that it was coming.

To participate in a riot is obviously a mistaken response to the kinds of dismal conditions that Clarke’s report described. But it isn’t enough to say this. It’s possible to recognise the personal responsibility that any of the inmates involved must hold, and then to ask: if I were in those circumstances, what would I do? And what can be done to make such an eruption less likely in future?

Since the justice minister, Liz Truss, doesn’t seem to feel that the defence of the independence of the judiciary need take up too much of her energy, she should have ample time to consider these questions. She might start with the number of inmates held at Bedford, 493, and compare that with the number it is intended to hold, 322. Or she might go back to Clarke’s report and read again the paragraph about the effect of staff shortages on the conditions under which inmates are held, noting that for the fifth of prisoners who are unemployed, 21 hours a day locked in their cells is not unusual – with some banged up for 23. If you cage prisoners like animals, deny them the chance to do anything productive with their time or feel as if they are progressing towards a useful goal, you should expect them to respond in the same spirit.

Quite often since 2010, union warnings that cuts are making a difference to safety standards in all sorts of fields have been met with the cynical assumption that the truth has more to do with an attempt to preserve a cushy way of life. But the POA’s warnings are backed by concrete evidence. In the year to June, there were about 6,000 assaults on staff – an increase of 43%. Over the past four years they have risen 171%. Suicides and assaults generally are at an all-time high. In the second quarter of this year there were 9,500 detected cases of self-harm in three months and 31 self-inflicted deaths, also a record. These figures should be a source of shame, but the truth is that they are hardly noticed: the persistent and uncivilised decline of our prisons is simply not surprising any more. And when 7,000 officers have been made redundant in the past six years – or about 30% – it is entirely logical that the ability of the remainder to manage a safe prison estate has been drastically compromised.

Last week, Truss announced the recruitment of 2,500 new officers at the cost of £104m – a start, but a small one against the scale of the previous reduction (when it is, anyway, not as if the prison estate in 2010 could be characterised as a rehabilitative utopia). If she is unwilling or unable to find the money to make the more significant investment needed, what else is she going to do? Not take steps to reduce the prison population, she insists: such a step would be “arbitrary”. And yet when Hardwick was leaving, he argued forcefully that a large proportion of the prison population simply shouldn’t be there because they had mental health problems, or were guilty of minor crimes for which a custodial sentence was actively counterproductive. In these cases, it is incarceration that seems arbitrary, not the idea that there might be a better way to deal with the problem.

If Truss is really concerned about the risks that come with “arbitrary” changes to the prisons system, she will have to go much further in reversing the cuts that Grayling instituted years ago, and which were always motivated not by the security and rehabilitation of inmates – and hence the security of the rest of us – but by the bottom line.

In the meantime, we should get used to the kind of trouble that unfolded yesterday at Bedford. Blame the prisoners if you want, but they do not exist in a vacuum; their disorder is a howl of protest at a system that is simply not fit to keep them safe, and their plight is a stain on our national conscience.

The director of public prosecutions is considering a complaint that voters were misled by the Vote Leave and Leave.EU campaigns, in contravention of electoral law.

The complaint about “undue influence” on the referendum campaign has been submitted by an independent group, spearheaded by Prof Bob Watt, an expert in electoral law from the University of Buckingham.

Though most cases require a police complaint before evidence can be considered by the Crown Prosecution Service, under the 1983 Representation of the People Act the DPP can consider cases of election offences when they are referred to her office directly.

A CPS spokesperson said: “We can confirm that this letter has been received and we are currently considering its content.” The complaint is being considered by the special crime team, which deals with all election offences.

Under electoral law “undue influence” is considered a corrupt practice and includes the use of “a fraudulent device or contrivance” to “impede or prevent or intend to impede or prevent the free exercise of the franchise”.

The evidence submitted to the DPP cites a 1992 case where members of the Liberal Democrats produced a leaflet headed “Labour News”, with quotes from Labour politicians and purporting to set out Labour policies in Tower Hamlets.

That leaflet was deemed by the courts to be an attempt to mislead voters, though the law at the time did not consider that to be an offence. However, the law was changed by the Electoral Administration Act of 2006, which made an attempt to mislead voters an offence of “undue influence” – although Watt said that had not been tested by the courts so far.

Watt and his colleagues who have prepared the case say it centres on “instances where the leave campaigns continued to make assertions of fact that were knowingly misleading”, including the oft-cited claim of the EU costing the UK £350m a week.

That claim, made by Vote Leave, was contrary to evidence from the Office for National Statistics, Watt said. Other instances cited to the DPP include alleged misrepresentations on pro-Brexit leaflets that Nissan and Unilever supported leaving the EU.

Watt also cited Vote Leave’s posters that claimed “Turkey is joining the EU”, as well as the assertion that “the UK has no border controls whilst in the EU” when billions are spent on the UK Border Agency.

Some other cases had been excluded, Watt said, including George Osborne’s so-called “punishment budget” in support of remain, because it was “an expression of opinion” rather than a matter of fact.

“Whilst that may be considered by some as deplorable, only claims which amount to assertion of fact are likely to meet the test for undue influence,” Watt said. “Our primary aim in seeking prosecution is to try to restore some integrity to our democratic processes.

“None of us is willing to allow the UK to be dragged down to some kind of populist ‘who can lie and deceive the most?’ race to the bottom, such as we witnessed earlier this year.”

If a case was brought successfully, it would not have any bearing on the referendum result or prevent the UK leaving the EU, but could result in criminal punishment of anyone held responsible by the courts for making false statements.

Watt said the laws that “protect against corrupt campaigning practices” needed to be imposed. “Ultimately it will be for parliament to decide, based on the court’s judgment on evidence that there was undue influence, if that has bearing on whether the EU referendum result should be considered as democratically safe,” he said.

Although Vote Leave is no longer functioning , the Guardian has contacted Change Britain, its successor organisation, which campaigns to leave the single market, as well as its former chief executive, Matthew Elliott, at his new website Brexit Central asking for comment. Leave.EU has also been contacted.



The Lib Dem MP Tom Brake, patron of Vote Leave Watch, said: “It looks like the leaders of the Vote Leave campaign will be needing to spend some of that £350m on lawyers’ fees rather than our NHS.

“Vote Leave went beyond the normal bounds of political campaigning, telling blatant untruths about our contribution to the EU budget, Turkey joining the European Union, and much more. It’s about time they were held to account for misleading the British people.”

Conditions at Bedford prison, where 200 inmates went on a six-hour rampage on Sunday, has declined to “unacceptable levels” with illegal drugs more readily available than clothes or sheets, prison inspectors said in September.

A prison service inquiry was getting under way on Monday into the disturbance which was “successfully resolved” late on Sunday night after riot control officers and emergency services spent more than six hours bringing the disturbance to an end.

Inmates flooded the jail’s gangways after the unrest broke out after 5pm on Sunday after staff were forced to retreat to “safe areas” within the jail. Unverified mobile phone footage showed chaotic scenes with scores of prisoners out of their cells shouting in gangways and walkways.

Specialist riot officers were deployed at the category B prison in Bedford town centre after the riot broke out on Sunday afternoon, with police cordoning off an area outside and emergency services on standby.

A prison service spokesman said: “Specially trained prison officers and staff from the emergency services have successfully resolved an incident involving a number of prisoners at HMP Bedford.

“An investigation into this incident will take place. We are absolutely clear that prisoners who behave in this way will be punished and could spend significantly longer behind bars.” 



Bedfordshire Police said three men, aged 39, 37 and 26, have been arrested on suspicion of offences under the Prison Security Act 1992. 



Two inmates were taken to hospital - one who became ill and another who suffered minor injuries during the riot. Both returned to prison after treatment.

Richard Fuller, the MP for Bedford and Kempston, is expected to press the justice secretary, Elizabeth Truss, on Monday for further details. The disturbance at Bedford comes just days after Truss detailed her prison safety and reform plans, including a recruitment drive for 2,500 more prison officers.

Steve Gillan, the general secretary of the Prison Officers Association, stopped short of describing the incident as a riot classing it instead as “concerted indiscipline” and said up to 200 prisoners could have been involved. He added: “The POA has been warning about this situation of violence in our prisons – it would appear it’s coming to fruition. I just hope there’s no prisoners or indeed prison officers injured in the violence.”

HMP Bedford, which has been on its current site since 1801, holds about 500 inmates, according to an HM Inspectorate of Prisons report in September.

Gillan said the mobile phone footage, which also showed paper and furniture strewn on the floor, appeared to be authentic, saying: “With everything else that has been going on at Bedford, it is hard to believe that this is not from Bedford. It ties in with the issues that were going on at Bedford.

“I think there were mobile phones at Bedford, which are not allowed but, by the same token, our prisons are awash with mobile phones and drugs, which are not allowed.”

Initial reports suggested that staff at Bedford had refused to unlock prisoners on safety grounds but had been overruled by managers.

Peter Clarke, the chief inspector of prisons, in his report on Bedford prison in September said that many prisoners were living in crowded and cramped conditions. The inspectors found that there had been a dramatic increase in levels of self-harm and the proportion of inmates saying they had developed a drug problem while inside had risen from 4% at the previous inspection in 2014 to 14% this year.

Clarke also criticised the prison management’s “abject failure” to implement 60 out of the 72 recommendations made after the last inspection in 2014.

Does the Daily Mail want us to vote for judges? Would it prefer Britain to adopt the system of certain states in the US where judges are chosen by the electorate?

That is the logical conclusion from its persistent assault on the judiciary. In its intemperate “Enemies of the people” front page on Friday, the opening sentence stated:

Monday’s leading article opened with a similar jibe, referring to the “three unelected high court judges” who “handed down from their lofty benches a ruling that rode roughshod over the views of 17.4m voters”.

Although its target appeared to be Lord Patten - “that perfect embodiment of the arrogant political class” and “self-appointed censor-in-chief” - the Mail’s main concern were the men and women in wigs.

It was aware of the backlash that followed its reaction to the high court’s ruling that the prime minister, Theresa May, cannot trigger article 50 to begin Brexit without a parliamentary vote.

The Mail, in company with the Daily Telegraph and Daily Express, came under heavy flak from politicians and rival newspapers for their assaults on the judges.

The Guardian was particularly exercised by the “hysterical, and frankly ludicrous, response” to the judgment by “rightwing newspapers”. It continued:

But the Mail’s editor, Paul Dacre, doesn’t do retreat. So he went back on the offensive by widening the paper’s assault on “one of the last great unreformed British institutions”. His editorial contended:

That’s a fair enough point. And many will agree with the Mail’s concern about the judiciary being “a virtual closed shop, with supreme court judges largely selected by their peers”.

Many newspapers of the left have made similar arguments down the years, but what is the Mail’s solution and, more pertinently, what is its motive? It said:

“Calls for public hearings to gauge candidates’ views and any political leanings - as happens in the US - have been resisted. Isn’t it time for a change? Surely, if judges have allegiances which may affect their decisions, the public has a right to know. For example, one of those involved in the high court ruling and several at the supreme court have links with the EU and European courts. How can such detail not be of relevance? Of course the high court insists its ruling was purely legalistic. But the political motivation behind the case - and those who brought it - is unashamed and transparent”.

But the paper doesn’t explain what should happen after such hearings. Will judges with “political leanings” unacceptable to those who oversee such public hearings - politicians? newspapers editors? - be denied their post?

Will the public then be called upon to vote for their favourite candidates, after having the benefit of sensibly impartial advice from the Mail?

In fact, the paper gave a clue about such advice in an article by its associate editor, Andrew Pierce, the journalist who puts the squeak in pipsqueak.

In his scrutiny of four law lords, he highlighted their links to Europe (how scandalous). He made much of the fact that two of them (Lords Reed and Kerr) had sat on the European court of human rights. Worse still: Kerr “is an unashamed champion of the human rights act brought in by the Blair government”.

As for the career of Lord Mance - who is “fluent in several languages” - it “has been saturated in the processes of European law”. And Lord Carnwath is just as bad, having been “steeped in EU laws and tradition”.

Nudge, nudge to readers: don’t vote for them! 



And here’s another example of the Mail’s straightforward, factual reporting. A headline across two pages on Monday said “May backs Press in judges row”. But did she?



In fact, her statement was even-handed between press and judiciary and, therefore, utterly unremarkable. Indeed, it was much more significant, given the storm, that she backed the judges.

Looking way down the Mail’s article was the following quote:

And in a second quote, the prime minister also said: “It is important that we have the independence of the judiciary. It is also important that we have a free press”.

So that headline could just as easily have said: “May backs judges in Press row”.

I have worked as a GP over the past decade in about a third of the around 140 prisons in England and Wales – all categories, male and female – and in all there has been a gradual increase in the prison population, leading to overcrowding.

This reflects the national situation. Ministry of Justice figures show that between June 1993 and June 2012 the prison population in England and Wales increased by 41,800 prisoners, to more than 86,000. Without urgent steps aimed at cutting the prison population this could exceed 100,000 by 2020. However, this has not been matched by a corresponding increase in the number of prison officers. On the contrary, their numbers have been cut.

When our prisons are at crisis point, amid continuing controversy about incidents such as the recent killing at Pentonville, consider our direction of travel. Take HMP Berwyn, the so-called super prison expected to open in February 2017.

Built at the cost of £212m and located at Wrexham in Wales, HMP Berwyn is expected to accommodate 2,100 category C prisoners – those who cannot be allowed to move freely but are considered unlikely to try to escape. Instead of taking steps to radically reduce the UK prison population the government keeps building more prisons to house even more prisoners.

I have come across numerous cases over the years where a noncustodial sentence would have been more appropriate than imprisonment. I recall a heavily pregnant lady suffering from a life-threatening condition who was jailed for breaching a restraining order. What was to be expected of a pregnant sufferer confined for a good deal of the time in a small, poorly ventilated prison cell? During her time behind bars she was rushed to hospital several times. Whenever she was there, for sometimes up to a week and longer, she was guarded round the clock by prison officers.

I recall another instance when the nurse, seeing the new arrivals on reception duty, sent me the following message, asking me to prescribe a short course of sleeping tablets for a recent arrival. She was in prison for failing to pay a bill. Her partner was supposed to be looking after their young children but, the message said: “she does not believe he is up to the task. She is in a very weepy state and unable to sleep. She has another four weeks to do – could you please help?”

These women represent a not insignificant proportion of the prison population who are not a “danger to the public”. So why is the state spending large sums to keep them behind bars?

Ministry of Justice figures from 2013 revealed that 55% of prisoners connected their offences to drug-taking, with the need for money to buy drugs the most commonly cited factor. Eliminating the addiction factor could lead to the closure of about half the prisons in the UK and free resources for other matters.

Sending these people to jail in the hope of ridding society of the menace of drug abuse is a woefully inadequate approach to the complex problem of drugs. It is akin to a doctor treating the symptoms of a disease without concerning themselves with its cause or its future prevention. There should instead be a holistic approach to the problem of drug addiction, with treatment and rehabilitation forming the centrepiece.

And then there are the inmates with mental health issues. Surely these are best handled in psychiatric institutions rather than prison. Instead of spending millions on “super prisons”, the state would be better employed building additional psychiatric hospitals and homes to accommodate the hundreds, if not thousands, of them languishing in jail. Instead of helping them to overcome their mental impairment, society is punishing them for a condition they cannot help having. Labelling them criminals on a par with those who commit armed robbery, rape and murder is antiquated at best and nonsensical at worst. Samuel Butler lampooned this stance in his classic satire, Erewhon, describing a culture who imprisoned the sick for the crime of not being well. That was published in 1872, but what has changed since then?

A report published last month by the RSA’s Future Prison project says the prison and probation services in England and Wales are failing to protect the public because they do not rehabilitate offenders, and that they should be radically restructured. I welcome the rehabilitation aspect, but it still ignores the central issue of population.

We need urgently to address sentencing, because too many offenders are being sent to prison for short terms. A record-breaking case was that of a lady who was jailed one evening only to be released the next day. I believe any sentence below three months should be suspended, turned into fines or whatever other punishment society deems appropriate short of an actual prison sentence.

As for drug addicts, the power to sentence them to drug rehabilitation homes makes sense for everybody. Keeping the most dangerous criminals – sex offenders, murderers, terrorists, armed robbers, and so on – in jail, and finding alternative punishment for those committing petty crimes, would not only lead a radical reduction in the prison population, it would also allow for the proper supervision of extremely dangerous inmates.

Whatever else is said this week, population reduction is where our focus is and it is quite achievable. What is really needed is the will.

Theresa May’s commitment to protect workers’ rights after Brexit has come into question before a House of Commons debate on the impact leaving the EU will have on employment laws.

The prime minister made a pledge to stick to EU protections such as guarantees of paid holiday, maternity and paternity rights and time off in between shifts. But an examination of her past statements on workers’ rights reveals that she repeatedly attacked the then Labour government’s decision to sign up to the EU’s social chapter when the Conservatives were in opposition.

Proposals arising out of the social chapter included rights for pregnant women to get 14 weeks’ statutory leave at sick pay rates, the 48-hour maximum working week and equal employment rights for part-time temporary staff who work at least eight hours a week.

In a column for ConservativeHome in 2007, May suggested Labour’s decision to sign up to the EU’s social chapter and domestic laws was a sign of their weakness in caving in to trade unions.

“Unbelievably, for the government that gave the unions the social chapter, several employment relations acts, new union rights, a cop-out on public sector pensions, the Warwick agreement, and the union modernisation fund, some journalists are still prepared to say that, these days, Labour stands up to the unions,” she wrote.

Several times in the House of Commons, May also spoke out against aspects of the EU’s social chapter, such as the part-time workers’ directive, saying it was a burden to business and cost jobs.

In 1999, as shadow leader of the Commons, May claimed women’s jobs were “under threat from the government’s adherence to the social chapter and handling of the economy”.

May promised at the Conservative party conference that all workers’ rights enshrined in EU law would be transferred into British law, with a “great repeal bill” that would simply duplicate all protections.

However, Labour has suspicions that the government may try to wriggle out of some aspects, such as the working time directive which is particularly disliked by many Conservative MPs.

Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, stressed that preserving workers’ rights would be a “bottom line” for May to get his party’s support for triggering article 50, which now looks likely to have to be approved by parliament after a landmark legal judgment.

However, it is still possible that the Conservatives could try to unpick some workers’ rights after they have been enshrined in the great repeal bill at a later date.

Some Conservative MPs, including former party chairman Grant Shapps, have raised the idea of a “sunset clause” in the great repeal bill, meaning all EU law would expire unless it has been specifically endorsed anew by the government.

In answers to parliamentary questions submitted by Matthew Pennycook, the shadow Brexit minister, the government already appears to have watered down its commitment to replicate EU employment protections, only promising to do so “wherever practical”.

Labour is expected to raise May’s past statements on workers’ rights at the parliamentary debate on the EU and employment law on Monday. It is the first in a series of Commons debates on elements of Brexit after the government bowed to the demands from MPs for greater scrutiny of the negotiations.

Pennycook said: “Despite the prime minister’s warm words, British workers will struggle to shake the suspicion that her stated commitment to preserving their rights at work is merely cosmetic.

“Amidst the government’s Brexit chaos, the prime minister owes it to the working people of Britain to set out precisely how existing workers’ legal rights will be guaranteed in law once we have left the EU.”

Melanie Onn, the Labour MP for Grimsby who has tried to introduce a private members’ bill to protect workers rights post-Brexit, also raised concerns that the government may try to chip away at employment protections after the UK has left the EU.

“I suspect there will be an incremental loss over a period of time. A lot of rights are currently covered by EU law. The things I think will be particularly vulnerable are around situations in redundancies, protection against discrimination, health and safety regulation and working-time rights,” she said.

Onn also highlighted May’s position when the government under David Cameron introduced fees for employment tribunals, which has led to a dramatic decline in the number of claims of discrimination by employees against businesses.

There are also questions over whether employment case law from the European courts will be taken into account by British courts after the UK leaves the EU.

The official leave campaign attacked a variety of employment laws emanating from the EU before the referendum. Priti Patel, then part of the Vote Leave campaign and now one of May’s cabinet ministers, attacked the cost of EU social and employment law for businesses.

“If we could just halve the burdens of the EU social and employment legislation we could deliver a £4.3bn boost to our economy and 60,000 new jobs,” she claimed in May.

“This government’s commitment to building a country that works for everyone means we will maintain and enhance workers’ rights as we leave the EU,” he said.

“The process is straightforward: at the point of exit we will transfer the body of EU law into domestic legislation including all the protection provided for workers. The prime minister and secretary of state for leaving the EU have been absolutely clear about that.

“The fact that Labour is spending its time trying to pretend something different shows it is just trying to find excuses to undermine and thwart the referendum result. Only the Conservatives can be trusted to respect the result and work to make a success of it for workers and businesses.”

Lord chancellor’s statement judged ‘too little, too late’ amid febrile media reaction to high court’s article 50 decision
###########################################################
Theresa May and her justice secretary, Liz Truss, have been forced to defend the three high court judges who made the controversial high court judgment about Brexit in the face of days of public backlash.

Truss, whose silence on Friday as criticism of the judgment intensified had infuriated senior lawyers, issued a public statement on Saturday night defending the integrity of the lord chief justice, who had been accused by former Ukip leader Nigel Farage of being a pro-EU activist.

“The lord chief justice is a man of great integrity and impartiality. Like all judges, he has sworn an oath to administer the law without fear or favour, affection or ill will,” Truss said.

Separately, Theresa May, speaking to reporters on her way to Delhi for a trade mission on Sunday, defended the right of the judges to issue their ruling, but would not condemn the media backlash over the issue.

Asked about the controversial reaction to the ruling in which the judges were branded as the “enemies of the people” in coverage from pro-Brexit newspapers, the prime minister said: “I believe in and value the independence of our judiciary, I also value the freedom of our press. These both underpin our democracy.”

The prime minister also said her government was determined that its appeal to the supreme court would force the ruling, which prevents the formal process of exiting the EU from beginning without a vote in the Commons and the Lords, to be overturned.

Truss, whose role as lord chancellor means she must uphold the independence of the judiciary, was responding to comments by Farage, who told the BBC’s Marr on Sunday show that he believed the lord chief justice, Lord Thomas, should have recused himself from the case.

Farage highlighted the lord chief justice’s involvement in the European Law Institute, which seeks to harmonise EU legislation.

“Surely with that background he should have absented himself from this particular case?” he said, adding, “I’m afraid that the reach of the EU into the upper echelons of society in this country makes it quite difficult for us to trust the judgments.”

The prime minister hopes to use her visit to India to show that Britain can strike up new lucrative economic relationships with countries outside the EU after Brexit.

But back in Britain, the highly charged debate over the impact of the court’s decision intensified, with Farage suggesting any attempt by MPs to soften Brexit could unleash a wave of public anger that could spill onto the streets.

Farage, who is acting as interim Ukip leader while his party goes through its second leadership race since the summer, said: “If the people in this country think that they’re going to be cheated, that they’re going to be betrayed, then we will see political anger the likes of which none of us in our lifetimes have ever witnessed in this country. Those newspaper headlines are reflecting that.”

Asked on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show on Sunday whether he thought that could mean “disturbances” on the streets if parliament seeks to water down the result of the referendum, he said: “I think that’s right,” adding: “the temperature of this is very, very high.” He appeared on the programme alongside Gina Miller, the businesswoman who led the high court challenge.



Meanwhile Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn made clear that his party would not vote against a bill implementing article 50, after his insistence that he would welcome an early general election was interpreted as a threat to try to force the government to accept his red lines on Brexit, including safeguards for workers’ rights.

Instead, Corbyn said he would press for “transparency and accountability” about the government’s aims in the two-year negotiation process. However, senior Liberal Democrats, including Nick Clegg, have suggested they could try to use the parliamentary process to block Brexit altogether.

May condemned that idea, saying: “The people spoke on 23 June,” insisting there would be no compromise on her position that free movement was a red line in any post-Brexit deal.

“The people spoke on the 23 June and an important aspect that underpinned people’s approach to that was a concern about control of movement of people from the EU into the UK. I believe it is important for the UK government to deliver on that.”

Brexit secretary David Davis is expected to use a statement to the House of Commons on Monday to reiterate the government’s determination to appeal to the supreme court, and stick to its timetable of triggering article 50 by the end of March.

The prime minister highlighted the fact that a similar legal case in Belfast had resulted in an opposite ruling. “In terms of the legal situation we’ve had two court cases in the UK, they’ve come out with different decisions. The Northern Irish court found in favour of the government, the high court found against the government.

“We think we have strong legal arguments and will be taking those arguments to the supreme court,” she said. “What’s important for MPs and peers is to recognise that parliament voted to give the decision on our membership of the European Union to the people on 23 June. A majority voted and we should now deliver.”



Some Conservatives had reacted angrily to the tone of some of the coverage of the judgment, in which the justices involved were singled out as, “enemies of the people”. Former attorney-general Dominic Grieve said some of the headlines had made him feel as though he was in “Robert Mugabe’s Zimbabwe”.

Truss had issued a general statement on Saturday defending the legitimacy of the legal system, after communities secretary Sajid Javid had accused the high court of trying to “thwart the will of the people”.

Former Conservative minister Lord Patten condemned Javid yesterday, saying on ITV’s Peston on Sunday that the Bromsgrove MP should have been “out on his ear” for making the comments.

“We actually need to behave more decently to one another and with a great deal more respect,” he said, adding: “it is for Theresa May to give that sort of leadership.”

I would not hold out any great hopes for the recycled and tired initiatives announced by Liz Truss (Prisons given staff boost to tackle violence, 3 November). As a recently retired teacher of maths in prison, a job that I enjoyed immensely and where I came across a majority of motivated and diligent students with just a few resistant agitators, it seems to me that the general drift in offender education is the reverse of what is actually needed and has been given little thought in this radical new initiative, which is neither radical nor new.

The main provider of prison education in England sees this as a business opportunity and not a true mission to improve people’s life chances. Constant squeezing of the teachers’ terms, conditions and pay has led to an increasingly demoralised, casual and less-qualified workforce mirroring the situation in teaching in general, but amplified to an even greater degree. Closure of classes in painting and decorating, bricklaying and plastering – which would give real skills and job opportunities – for ones that can deliver immediate financial returns but fewer jobs in the real community does not work in the prisoners’ best interests. A constant drive to meet targets involving qualifications of doubtful benefit, notwithstanding the fact that the introduction of functional skills has been a good development, does not give prisoners the bits of paper that will really help them. I could carry on.

Prison education is a fundamental component of any reform strategy and needs creativity, imagination and a motivated, competent, decently rewarded and dedicated and secure staff, but if it continues to be driven as a commercial venture based on marketing, intimidation, target culture and a casual and cowed workforce with poor leadership it will continue to fail the prisoners.

• It isn’t just bleeding-heart Guardian readers who want prisons to rehabilitate rather than punish those who are let down by the understaffing of prisons. The “bang ’em up” brigade who demand security are being let down too.

Contraband is being delivered to upper cells in Pentonville prison in London by drone. All it needs is a warder outside with a mobile phone to call the inside staff and say: “It’s the end cell on The Twos” or whatever and it stops. But there aren’t enough staff to do this. The result is a rampaging drug-fuelled and illicit economy on the wings that engenders criminality rather than deters it.

There is scant scope for reform and rehabilitation inside today’s prisons but staff cuts ensure that ever more prisoners are released with experiences that ensure they will fail again. This a fraud perpetrated on the victims of crime by the state and must be stopped.

Nik Wood

London

• Welcome though the home secretary’s topping up of the recently announced 400-strong increase in the number of prison officers to 2,500 is, it still leaves the service 4,500 short of the number employed in 2010. Ken Clarke is right to criticise the government’s failure to acknowledge that we have too many people in prison, for too long, including many on remand who do not end up with custodial sentences. It’s shameful, and counterproductive, that we have the highest rate of incarceration in Europe with the unappealing exceptions of Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic.

Shadow justice minister, House of Lords

• Shouldn’t your headline have more accurately read “Government partially reverses previous prison staff cuts”?

Michael Miller

Sheffield

• It is quite remarkable that your editorial (Prison won’t work without changes to sentencing, 4 November) could fail to mention the important role probation services have in this process. Indeed, to see that prison is “a total institution”, without any reference to the transition from prison to the community (commonly known as “through the prison gate”), is simply to reinforce the lack of strategic vision that characterises government’s criminal justice policy.

More offenders are going to prison for a variety of reasons (some acceptable, some less so); prison officer numbers are reducing; violence in both the male and female estate is escalating at an alarming rate. The government introduces a complete shake-up of the probation service in order to assist in short-term prisoner rehabilitation. Reports from the Inspectorate of Probation suggest this is failing badly. Where is the strategic vision? Where is the understanding and realisation that penology requires a whole-system approach, not an issue-by-issue kneejerk response?

Andy Stelman

Bishop’s Castle, Shropshire

• Your leader could have been written 40 years ago when I first joined the probation service. In essence, the debate is unchanged from that time. Perhaps there is a crisis in prisons because of the significant reduction in operational staff, but you are right to point out that fewer prison officers has nothing to do with the unacceptable size of the prison population and the consequent pressures therein.

Clearly prisons need more staff, but what we are also now seeing is the deleterious effect of the ideological and systematic changes imposed on the probation service from the mid-1990s onwards. The fundamental shift from care and control (rooted in rehabilitation) to punishment and enforcement (rooted in “protection of the public”), which began around that time, has meant that probation service interventions have tended to add to prison numbers rather than being significantly influential in their reduction. I’m not saying that protection of the public isn’t a necessary consideration for any criminal justice agency, or indeed that the probation service does not still undertake valuable rehabilitative work. But its position with courts, policymakers and the community at large, as a primary alternative to custody, somehow has got lost and it is hard to see things changing for the better with regard to sentencing and prison numbers until that important ground is regained.

Michael J Miller

Shipley, West Yorkshire

• There has been no mention of the probation service in all the press coverage of the prisons crisis.

I qualified as a probation officer at LSE in 1956. When asked at the Home Office why I chose to do so I replied: “To keep women out of prison.” I supervised many women offenders on probation. All cared for their families and did not offend again.

Nowadays prison very rarely works. The probation service needs to be given proper recognition again.

Last week, the US supreme court announced it will hear the transgender bathroom rights case, GG v Gloucester County School Board. Gavin Grimm, a trans senior at Gloucester high school in Virginia, is fighting for his right to use the boys’ bathroom at school, and the school district is appealing to the highest court in the country to keep him out.

A ruling is unlikely before Gavin’s graduation, and he will continue to face crippling discrimination every day of what should be his celebratory senior year.

But the impending ruling has effects beyond Gavin. Parents of transgender children across the nation are holding our collective breath, because our children’s safety and dignity are at stake, too.

The Scotus announcement lands amid continued outrage surrounding North Carolina’s now infamous HB2 law, prohibiting transgender people from accessing the facilities appropriate to their gender identity all in the name of “protecting women and children”.

Let’s talk about privacy, since those who oppose transgender bathroom rights are so fixated on its protection. As middle school girls, many of us were so insecure about our bodies that we were mortified by the idea of changing openly. Personally, I don’t remember looking at anyone’s bodies. Singling out our transgender daughters as a threat to the other girls’ privacy simply based on their genitalia is sexualizing them, plain and simple.

Every bathroom controversy is a direct hit to our children. In particular, the argument against transgender rights in the name of protecting female spaces is – as the mothers of transgender daughters – what threatens our hard-fought progress combating dangerous anti-trans legislation. It also undermines our even harder-fought progress teaching our girls, transgender and cisgender alike, that they are valued members of society, and legitimate shades of womanhood.

We all want to safeguard our children, and some of us have cisgender (that is, not transgender) daughters and sons as well as transgender children. But when it comes to our daughters’ safety, we, the mothers and co-signers of this piece, are far more wary of men emboldened by a generalized epidemic of misogyny and permissive rape culture than we are of the transgender women who are just trying to live an authentic life with dignity.

Transgender women themselves – particularly trans women of color – are marginalized and singled out as victims of brutal violence at a staggering rate. In 2016 to date, 23 transgender women were murdered in the United States, nearly all women of color, most of them black. There is no question that transphobia coupled with racism is a lethal combination.

Several of us have transgender daughters who are brown, black or biracial. The clear and present danger for these girls as they develop into young trans women is chilling. As long as we perpetuate the unsubstantiated threat of trans people in intimate spaces, our vulnerable trans youth will continue to be viewed as the monsters under the bed.

My own daughters are young enough to bathe together. They are sisters. I imagine in the locker room, all of our trans girls will view their friends as most girls do: like sisters, genitalia aside. Some radical feminist groups would say that our trans daughters’ membership to the sacred sisterhood is empirically denied, simply because of their anatomy. They are effectively reducing women to our genitalia. That sounds more like a Trumped-up brand of feminism than the real thing, if you ask me.

Fringe groups may play the heavyweights, funding anti-LGBTQ legislation across the country, but their special breed of transphobic evangelism must not be representative of who we are as a nation. Transgender activist and actress Laverne Cox of Orange Is the New Black famously said that “loving transgender people is a radical act”. In America, countless thousands of families across religions, races and political views are engaging in that very radical act of loving and advocating for our transgender children every day.



Gavin Grimm is a young man, regardless of what is between his legs. Our daughters are girls, regardless of what is between theirs. Like Gavin – like all trans people – our children are merely fighting to use the bathroom they feel is the safest, and most appropriate, without fear or shame.

Our phrase of the week – “enemies of the people” – starts out, in the singular, as the ironic description of a hero in Henrik Ibsen’s play, battling corruption in a public health scandal and prepared to endure vilification for his efforts.

This was not quite the sentiment behind the headline, used last week in the Daily Mail to describe the high court judges, after they ruled that parliament must be consulted on Brexit. From my days in the East German archives reading about documents about the Volksfeind (applied in the 1950s to pretty much anyone who disagreed with the dimwitted Stalinist leader Walter Ulbricht), it’s awfully familiar.

Germans already knew it from the Nazi lexicon. It was popularised by a Karl Astel, a National Socialist university rector who declared tobacco an “enemy of the people”, when not otherwise busy on the racialist eugenics programme and trying to set up an SS university. You cannot keep a good bad phrase down.

In a democratic culture, the way we communicate our political battles is heated when contentious subjects are in play. Yet language, in such circumstances, is not just the funnel of arguments. It has its own momentum and impact, deepening divides and replacing the instinct of moderation and compromise with the assumption that anyone who disagrees with the speaker must be an idiot or traitor.

I say all this not as a Brexit wound-licker, hoping the lofty men in wigs will magically unravel the result of a referendum. Legal language often hides its own self-importance behind big words. Brexit, the ruling claims, is “justiciable”, which is a fancy way of judges deciding that it is fine for them to rule on the triggering of a policy decision taken by the prime minister about the exit mechanism from the EU.

Increasingly, from press freedom to the PM’s day job, there is little judges don’t feel is their duty to rule on. That presents a serious risk of the balance of power tipping too much to the courts, which do not, as their backers in this case claim, just “uphold” law, but re-interpret it with a view to challenge or changing a political decision.

Many progressives support this, in the high court’s recent example, because the change happens to suit their own wishes. But when a democratic vote has taken place with high participation, there is a question mark over using the courts to throw sands in the wheels of what follows.

So we should expect this to be hard fought on both sides. And that is exactly the time at which language needs to be tempered, namely, when we feel least like being temperate. Alas, a particularly fractious zeitgeist is our backdrop. Exhibit A, as we contemplate the US election, is Donald Trump’s crass demagoguery and hokey claim to an “authentic” people-speak, concealing a nihilistic prospectus for power.

It is, however, glib to fault only the rhetoric of those we dislike. Look, too, to the kind of language used by those who would proudly disparage Trump and the Brexiters – and accord a too comfortable moral equivalence. It’s so easy to arrive at a point where a set menu of phrases shows that we have stopped thinking about the alternative position at all. So as soon as someone starts a sneery conversation featuring air quotes around the “£350m for the NHS” claim in the referendum campaign, and around “experts” and “control”, I know that they have probably not given much thought as to what drove the Brexit vote and why these arguments prevailed over their own.

Just as surely, we know that the words “migrants” and “breaking point” were intentioned to alarm voters and quell arguments about the balancing benefits of immigration.

Whingeing or listening back to an echo chamber of the like-minded will not address this. Liberals have not done a good job. On both sides of the Atlantic, they slip into a reactive language of being “terrified” or declaring political events “catastrophic”, when they mean that they are troublesome, difficult or just not to their taste. (It leaves us wondering what words might be left in which to describe events in, say, Aleppo.)

We have lost a political language of the moderate against the extremes, in the tradition of Orwell championed by this newspaper’s great ex-editor David Astor: one that conveys the benefits of the open against the closed and the pluralist against the autocratic, the flexible against the obdurate.

On the far left, Corbynism has opened the floodgates of that dreary old terminology of class hatreds. You only need to see the tweets about “Tory scum” to hear the ripples of hatreds and petty resentments. Left and right miserably collude in the weakening of tolerant discourse, because seeing the other person’s point of view might occlude their own certainties.

In his book Enough Said, Mark Thompson, the ex-BBC boss, now head of the New York Times, argues that the result is “just a fight to the political death, a fight in which every linguistic weapon is fair game”. A fair point. But the question of where to draw the line – and how to do so will decide whether we make things worse or better. Overdo it and liberals come across as pearl-clutching hysterics loath to be challenged. Without doubt, that was one of the traits and tonal inadequacies that let down the Remain camp’s arguments. Do we go down the road suggested by Alastair Campbell, formerly New Labour bruiser, last week suggesting that the Mail’s editor be arraigned for incitement to hatred? Old feuds, new battles.

Yet more windy threats are unlikely to clear poison from the air and a lot more likely to stoke the next round of hostilities. We could easily run around for the next few years, trading aggressions and caging every unwelcome thought as an “incitement” to something or other. My right to speak out is your micro-aggression. Down the plughole, meanwhile, goes the culture of debate, a British asset better valued in the rest of the world than at home right now. So on Brexit and beyond, let’s speak plainly but courteously across the lines. And if it sounds like a hand-me-down from Hitler or Stalin, just leave it to their monstrous memories.

Jeremy Hunt has said giving MPs a vote on Theresa May’s Brexit negotiating plans would harm the economy, but parliament was “highly likely” to get a vote on the final deal.

Last week the prime minister’s plans for leaving the European Union were thrown into disarray when three senior judges ruled that parliament, not the executive branch, was responsible for starting the process.

But the health secretary said it would be damaging to force the prime minister to reveal her hand. “The impact on the economy will be far worse if through some parliamentary mechanisms Theresa May is forced to lay out her entire negotiating strategy,” Hunt told BBC1’s The Andrew Marr Show.



“Parliament passes laws – it always has – but government negotiates treaties,” he said. “You can’t decide international treaties by a simple vote of MPs … you have to give the government latitude to make a deal.”

MPs were already involved in scrutinising the plans, Hunt said, adding: “Government has said it is highly likely there will be a vote to ratify the deal.”

The justice secretary, Liz Truss, faced criticism this weekend from senior lawyers for failing to condemn media attacks on the high court judges who ruled on the case. But Hunt said: “The idea that the government does not passionately defend the independence of the judiciary and the sovereignty of parliament is absolute nonsense.”

He described the legal challenge as “processology” that was really aimed at stopping the UK from leaving the EU “at all costs”. The government is to appeal against the ruling to the supreme court, with a hearing expected early next month. Theresa May said on Sunday she was confident the court would overturn the decision.



Most MPs supported the remain campaign, but Hunt said he would still expect them to vote in support of leaving the union. If the Lords voted against the proposal it would be “incredibly difficult” and “unprecedented”, but, he said: “I think it’s highly unlikely that parliament wouldn’t in the end back a decision to trigger article 50.”

Hunt earlier warned: “The damage to the fabric of our democracy would be far, far worse if people felt the establishment was trying to unpick the decision they have made.”

He aimed to play down suggestions that fallout from the court case could force an early general election. “I think a general election is, frankly, the last thing the government wants. Theresa May wants to get on with the job – and, frankly, it’s the last thing the British people want,” he said.

Meanwhile, Gina Miller, the businesswoman behind the successful legal challenge, said the high court ruling had stopped the government behaving like a “tinpot dictatorship”.

The investment fund manager and philanthropist also said the press had “behaved disgracefully” following the court judgment. She told Andrew Marr: “This is about creating legal certainty and, actually, everyone in the country should be my biggest fan because I’ve used my own money, and a few of us used our own money, to create legal certainty for Mrs May to move ahead.”

She said it was “misdirection” to claim that the decision was unpicking parliamentary sovereignty. “The case is that she cannot use something called the royal prerogative to do it because we do not live in a tinpot dictatorship,” she said.

Miller, 51, was born in Guyana but grew up in Britain. She co-founded the firm SCM Private and previously launched a campaign with her hedge-fund manager husband, Alan, against mis-selling and hidden fund charges in the City of London’s fund management industry.

Reaction to the Brexit case had been fuelled by sexism, racism and homophobia, she said. “I was aware there would be nastiness because if there’s anything to do with the word Brexit, people lose their minds and it’s all about heart,” she said.

Nigel Farage warned there would be disturbances on the streets if parliament attempted to thwart Brexit. The interim Ukip leader said political anger – “the likes of which none of us in our lifetimes have ever witnessed” – would emerge if voters felt they were going to be “cheated” over the June referendum result to leave the EU.

He called on Brexit backers to “get even” through peaceful protests and oppose at the ballot box anyone who sought to overturn the process. But Farage claimed he was “finished” with party politics, as he sought to play down the possibility of him returning to the long-term leadership of Ukip.

The MEP said: “We may have seen Bob Geldof and 40,000 people in Parliament Square moaning about Brexit. Believe you me, if the people in this country think they’re going to be cheated, they’re going to be betrayed, then we will see political anger the likes of which none of us in our lifetimes have ever witnessed in this country. Those newspaper headlines are reflecting that.”

Asked if there was a real danger of “disturbance in the streets” if Brexit was thwarted by parliament, Farage replied: “I think that’s right. I heard you talking to Gina Miller earlier about the nasty things that have been said about her. Believe you me, I’ve had years of this, I’ve had years of hate mobs – taxpayer-funded hate mobs – chasing me around Britain.

“The temperature of this is very, very high. Now, I’m going to say to everybody watching this who was on the Brexit side: let’s try to get even, let’s have peaceful protests and let’s make sure in any form of election we don’t support people who want to overturn this process.”

The justice secretary, Liz Truss, is embroiled in an extraordinary row with the country’s barristers, after she was accused by the Bar Council of not fulfilling her role as “the conscience of the government”.

Truss has failed to condemn vitriolic attacks on the three judges who last week ruled that parliament must be given a vote before Britain triggers article 50, launching the Brexit process.

Chantal-Aimée Doerries QC, the chairman of the Bar, the representative body for barristers in England and Wales, told the Observer that the cabinet minister had a duty to uphold the rule of law. “[Her job] is sometimes called the conscience of the government and one would expect her to speak out on something like this,” she said.

The high court ruling on Thursday, which the government has said it will appeal, unleashed a torrent of personal abuse directed at the judiciary, with one prominent cabinet member claiming the judges’ decision was “unacceptable”.

Under huge pressure to defend the independence of Britain’s judges, Truss – who is also lord chancellor – issued a terse statement on Saturday, observing: “The independence of the judiciary is the foundation upon which our rule of law is built and our judiciary is rightly respected the world over for its independence and impartiality.”

Former Tory minister Anna Soubry condemned Truss for failing to say more. She said: “[The] lord chancellor has a duty to condemn the vilification, including a homophobic attack, of our judiciary. [She] has failed in her duty to defend our judiciary. As a former barrister I’m embarrassed and appalled.”

Truss’s statement came nearly two hours after the Bar Council passed a resolution regretting the justice secretary’s lack of a public statement and calling on her to condemn the “attacks” as a “matter of urgency”. However, Doerries said the statement did not offer the required defence of the judiciary, at what she described as a “dangerous” moment.

She said: “We would wish her to go further. The resolution passed by the Bar Council called upon her to condemn the attacks on the judiciary and it is that we are still looking for. It is that which is so potentially damaging to the justice system in this country. As lord chancellor, it falls within her role to uphold the rule of law.”

Asked if Truss had lost the confidence of the legal community, Doerries said: “It is an early stage in her appointment. All I am prepared to say is that we were disappointed that she hadn’t made a statement. She has now made a statement and I don’t think it goes far enough.”

Doerries said the Ministry of Justice had been aware that the resolution had been tabled at the Bar Council’s meeting at 11.40am, before the vote was passed at 12.10pm. The one-sentence statement from Truss, lacking any condemnation of the attacks, was issued at 1.46pm.

The leading barrister said: “One of the things that is disappointing, even as of this morning before the resolution, is that the lord chancellor hadn’t made a statement given the extent and the direct nature of the attacks in the press.”

By convention, judges cannot defend themselves from personal attacks, and rely on the government to step in. In the wake of Thursday’s ruling the three high court judges had been described by the Daily Mail as “enemies of the people”. The newspaper’s website ran a headline that read: “The judges who blocked Brexit: One founded a EUROPEAN law group, another charged the taxpayer millions for advice and the third is an openly gay ex-Olympic fencer.”

Asked on BBC Question Time if the high court judgment flew in the face of democracy, the communities secretary, Sajid Javid, said: “Yes, it does.” He added: “This is an attempt to frustrate the will of the British people, and it is unacceptable.”

The former Ukip leader Nigel Farage also tweeted: “After today’s judgment I’m really beginning to question the independence of our judiciary.”

The archbishop of Canterbury said he was “horrified” by the trolling the judges have received. “British values call for honest but good disagreeing, [we] need reconciliation not abuse,” he said.

On Saturday a spokesman for Theresa May said the prime minister accepted the judges’ right to rule on article 50, but May issued a statement attacking those “who seek to tie our negotiating hands”.

The prime minister added: “MPs and peers who regret the referendum result need to accept what the people decided. Now we need to turn our minds to getting the best outcome for our country.”

Keir Starmer, a former director of public prosecutions, claimed it had been Truss’s duty to come to the aid of judges as justice secretary and lord chancellor, and accused the cabinet minister of making a “non-statement” on Saturday.

Starmer, who is now the shadow Brexit secretary, said: “The prime minister’s statement is a pretty desperate attempt to deflect attention from the failure of the justice secretary to do her duty. After a long deafening silence, the justice secretary has finally come out with a non-statement.

“The government should have condemned the personal attacks on our independent judges straight away. Undermining our judiciary is corrosive of democracy. Judges cannot answer back and that’s why it’s important for the government to defend them. It has failed to do so.”

The shadow justice secretary, Richard Burgon, said Truss, whose lack of experience and legal background had already led to criticisms of her appointment, had now lost the confidence of the legal community. “Many now have no confidence in the lord chancellor to fulfil her statutory duty to protect the independence of the judiciary,” he said.

Writing in the Observer, Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, came to the aid of the judiciary, and suggested that she would be seeking a key role for the Scottish parliament and the Welsh assembly before the triggering of article 50.

She writes: “The high court’s ruling could not be a surprise to anyone who followed the case. That it has come to this is not the fault of the judges or those who took this action to court – it is entirely down to the arrogant determination of the UK government to plough their own furrow without consulting parliament or the rest of the country about their negotiating strategy.”

Jeremy Corbyn has said Labour will join forces with Tory Remain supporters and other parties to block article 50 if May does not guarantee access to single market. He suggested May, who has a slim Commons majority, would be forced into an early election if she fails to meet Labour demands, according to the Sunday Mirror.

In a landmark legal decision last Thursday, the high court upheld a legal challenge brought against the government by Gina Miller and others, and ruled the government cannot use the royal prerogative to trigger article 50 of the Lisbon treaty, and so formally commence the process to leave the EU, without parliamentary approval.

The court’s judgment means that the process must be subject to parliamentary control and oversight. Importantly (especially in the light of some recent media comments), the court stressed that this is purely a question of law and that the court is not concerned with, and does not express any view about, the merits of leaving the EU. That is a political consideration.

In brief, the case arose because article 50 allows the UK to withdraw from the EU “in accordance with its own constitutional requirements” – but there was disagreement as to what the UK constitution actually requires.

The government argued that it could use royal prerogative powers (namely, that residue of monarchical authority now exercised by ministers) to authorise the UK’s withdrawal. While it is clear that prerogative powers cover international relations and the conclusion of treaties, it is settled UK constitutional law that an act of parliament – in this case the European Communities Act (ECA) 1972 – cannot be supplanted by the exercise of a prerogative power.

The court accepted the claimants’ arguments that, once notice is given under article 50, some rights under EU law (as incorporated into domestic law by the ECA) would inevitably be lost on completion of the article 50 process. Therefore, the government cannot give notice under article 50 without reference to parliament. This judgment can be seen as a victory for parliament. During the EU referendum, voters were constantly urged to “take back control” and regain parliamentary sovereignty from the EU.

Yet in what sense is parliament taking back control, if the government is able, using its ancient prerogative powers, to manage the whole EU withdrawal process without any significant parliamentary involvement? That would be extremely undemocratic – and democracy is what we are told the EU referendum was about.

Furthermore, the court’s judgment makes clear that the exclusion of parliament in the process is not only undemocratic, it is illegal. There is a wealth of case law supporting the claimants’ case, some of it dating back to the 17th century and the English civil wars. Those wars, and the ejection of two kings during that century, established that parliament is sovereign and that the executive cannot ignore it, where it has no legal authority to do so.

This judgment makes clear that the government does not have any such legal authority in the context of triggering article 50. However, it must be stressed that the judgment also makes clear the importance of rights in the Brexit process. Much of the judgment concerns legal arguments over the ECA, which can seem arcane. Yet they are of vital importance to every citizen.

The EU has been described as a “new legal order” and it is in many important aspects different from ordinary international law. One such aspect has been the extent to which it confers rights on individuals. Through the ECA, every UK national has been endowed with rights under EU law – rights of free movement and residence in other EU countries, but also many other types of rights, such as employment rights, consumer rights, or rights to information. Some of these will vanish as a result of triggering article 50 and the withdrawal process.

The government has said it will transfer some EU law into UK law through a “great repeal bill”, and then decide in future whether or not to retain it. Thursday’s judgment makes clear that decisions that inevitably remove rights may not be taken by the executive alone. Parliament must be consulted.

What are the practical consequences of this judgment? First, a government spokesperson has said the government will appeal, in which case it will be fast-tracked and heard very quickly by the UK supreme court. The government might try to change its position, and argue that a notification under article 50 could be revoked – this would be the opposite of its high court concession that triggering article 50 would inevitably result in the withdrawal of the UK from the EU (and so lead to loss of individual rights). At present both government and claimants are treating the triggering of article 50 as the inevitable point when it becomes clear that the ECA will be repealed.

But if it were acknowledged that such a move is reversible, the point would be that, in triggering article 50 by executive act, the government would not be subverting statute at that point, it would not be rendering the ECA a dead letter, inevitably leading to a loss of rights.

Some believe a notification under article 50 is revocable. But this would involve a question of EU law, and the final answer could only be given by the European court of justice. Moreover, such a reversal of the government’s arguments would be politically risky, as it would amount to acknowledging that the UK might decide not to leave the EU, and that Brexit does not mean Brexit after all, perhaps not a very likely position for the government to take.

Thursday’s ruling is a strong judgment, by a powerful trio of judges including the lord chief justice, and its reasoning looks hard to overturn. If the ruling stands, it will be necessary for a bill to be introduced in parliament. Although it is highly unlikely parliament will vote against triggering article 50, parliament may well seek to impose certain conditions on the government.

The June referendum resulted in a vote for the UK to leave the EU. However, it did not determine the way in which the UK leaves the EU. The court’s judgment means that the elected parliament will have a role in debating and deciding many matters, rather than their being determined in private by the executive.

Finally, the judgment raises a question of the role of the devolved nations. If Westminster is to be involved, what about the devolved parliaments? By constitutional convention, devolved parliaments are asked for their consent when Westminster either legislates with regard to devolved matters (see section 28(8) of the Scotland Act) or where it legislates to increase or reduce their powers. If a bill is introduced allowing article 50 to be triggered, would this require legislative consent motions, and, if so, would the devolved nations give their consent? Conflicting answers have been given on this point, and the issue is highly politically charged.

One thing is clear – Brexit is constitutionally fascinating, as well as constitutionally problematic. It also raises as many difficult questions for our understanding of the British constitution as it does of the UK’s relationship with the European Union.

In itself no, because this is a ruling about how Brexit is achieved – the process – not the desirability or otherwise of it. The decision to leave has been taken and would require another referendum to reverse. What the judges decided was how the process of leaving had to be carried out. They determined that parliament should be the body that decides on matters to do with UK law, in this case the triggering of article 50, which sets the UK on a two-year path to exit and will mean EU laws no longer apply here. The government had argued this could be done by royal prerogative, effectively side-stepping parliament. The judges disagreed.

There is no doubt, however, that the judgment gives the Remain side, which has a majority in the Commons and Lords, new opportunities to try to ensure Brexit is not too hard, that we remain tied into as many of the EU’s projects – the single market, police cooperation, and research – as possible, while leaving full membership of the club. Longer term, some Remainers believe there is a chance that the public will turn against Brexit if and when people see that the rosy future they were promised outside the EU is not quite so easy to achieve after all. If the judgment means the dangers of leaving come more into the public mind, it is possible it could mark a turning point.

Theresa May made clear last week that she will appeal against the decision in the supreme court. The case will be heard next month, and a ruling made quite swiftly. If, as most people assume, that appeal fails, ministers will have to prepare legislation so that parliament can play the role the judges said it must, in setting in motion article 50.

The nightmare for the prime minister, however, is that she will no longer be able to hide behind her stock, stalling phrases, “Brexit means Brexit” and “we won’t give a running commentary” – that have covered the fact that ministers are unclear how to proceed as they never expected the public to vote to leave.

If May does not reveal quickly what kind of Brexit she wants (single market membership or not?), MPs will use the parliamentary process which the courts have insisted on to force decisions and clarity on her. They can seek to amend the bill which will have to be presented to them, to shape Brexit as they want to see it. A majority of MPs across all parties could then force her hand. If the Commons does not amend the bill, the House of Lords certainly will seek to do so.

Ministers have to try to find a position on Brexit that will win the backing of MPs and peers. How they do it, no one knows.

This will be the subject of great debate in both the Tory and Labour parties. Cabinet ministers were allowed to campaign as they wished before the referendum vote so it is difficult to see how Conservative MPs can be forced to vote against their wishes at this stage, particularly if amendments are submitted on issues such as single market membership. The Tory manifesto committed the party to safeguard the UK’s position in the single market, whether we left or stayed in the EU. So to force MPs to vote to leave it would not be popular with many. The danger of imposing a whip on MPs is that many will rebel. Informal cross-party alliances will be more important than the strictures of the whips.

It makes it more likely because the ruling has undermined the government (it lost in the courts) and highlighted May’s lack of a personal mandate and weakness in parliament. Her tiny Commons majority, shrunk further by the resignation of the Tory MP Stephen Phillips, leaves her in a perilous position in any contentious vote.

As she has insisted she does not intend to go to the country before 2020, doing so would be seen as a sign of her being buffeted around by events. An election – while likely to deliver a larger Tory majority – would be no easy fix, however. It would highlight profound splits in the Conservative party in parliament and between its MPs and supporters in the country.

Brexit would be put on hold for three months of national debate and squabbling and the economy could be harmed by more uncertainty. Labour would have to back an early election which most of its MPs would dread. It would be an election that nobody wanted. Rather than healing the divide over Brexit it could well deepen it.

The irony behind the arguments over the judges’ ruling is that Leave campaigners insist that – above all else – they want to “take back control” from European institutions and vest it again in British ones. But now that the UK’s own courts have made a ruling that complicates the passage towards a hard Brexit and argues for the very thing that Leave campaigners wanted most (parliament to be given back control) they complain that the judges’ assessment is a betrayal of the people. The danger now is that it will not just be faith in politicians that is harmed, but faith in the UK legal system as well.

The country’s unwritten constitution operates a delicate set of checks and balances, determined through precedent, involving the Crown, parliament, the executive and the judiciary. The call by the Bar Council for justice secretary Liz Truss to condemn attacks on the judges was the opening salvo in what could become a toxic and hugely destabilising inter-institutional war between key components of the system. The Brexit debate has asked fundamental questions about where power lies in the UK. It was simpler when parliamentary democracy operated on well trodden paths. But on 23 June the people spoke and the system is uncertain as to how to deliver their will.

Sensing that it could stir the Brexit-backing part of the population into a mass revolt against the judges, the Daily Mail labelled them “enemies of the people” on Friday and pointed out that one, Sir Terence Etherton, was “openly gay”.

What began as a question about the EU’s power has become a potentially very dangerous one about the power of the people and how far it can trump that of parliament and the courts.

Lord chancellor’s statement judged ‘too little, too late’ amid febrile media reaction to high court’s article 50 decision
###########################################################
A woman accused of beating herself up and faking her own violent rape has launched a bid to clear her name.

Layla Ibrahim, 29, from Carlisle, was seven months pregnant when she was given a three-year jail sentence in 2010 for perverting the course of justice. She had no history of mental illness and no previous criminal record. Her daughter spent the first year of her life in prison following Ibrahim’s conviction.

Now released, but reportedly unable to find work because of her criminal record, Ibrahim is launching an appeal with the criminal cases review commission, which examines possible miscarriages of justice. Ibrahim’s lawyers claim crucial forensic evidence was destroyed or ignored and that police failed to properly investigate witness sightings and possible suspects. In a letter written to the commission, her legal team allege that Cumbria police spent £153,990.95 to “prove” their hunch she had invented the entire account.

During her trial in July 2010, the prosecution accepted that Ibrahim had sustained significant injuries to her breasts and genitals before police had been called to see her on 4 January 2009. She had turned up distressed at her sister’s house in Carlisle in the early hours, saying she had been attacked on her way back from a night out with friends. She was in a dishevelled state, with her dress, bra and leggings showing signs of damage. She had also suffered a blow to her head, which may have been caused when she was knocked to the ground, and had lacerations, scratches and bruising to her knees, breasts and face, and was bleeding from the vagina.

A forensic physician, Dr Jason Payne-James, gave evidence at the trial suggesting most of her injuries “could” have been self-inflicted, with the intimate bruising perhaps caused by consensual sex of some sort. But Ibrahim’s new legal team argue Payne-James’s evidence was “highly speculative” and unreliable. It was challenged in court at the time by another forensic expert, Dr Catherine White, who has now written questioning the conviction.

When interviewed by police, Ibrahim said she had been attacked by two strangers and had lost consciousness but was not sure if she had been sexually assaulted. She talked only of recalling a “thud” in her vagina which she described as being like having an object in her vagina that was too big.

She told officers she had defended herself against the men with a pair of scissors from her handbag, swinging them at one of her attackers. The second man had taken the scissors from her, she said, and used them to cut her hair, before both men fled the scene. They took one of her shoes, perhaps to slow her escape.

She was taken for a forensic examination, in which a blond pubic hair was discovered – strongly suggesting intimate contact between her and another. But this potentially vital piece of evidence was destroyed in the lab during DNA testing, her lawyers say. Bloodstained leaves were found near the scene –the blood came from a male and was capable of forming a complete profile; however, this did not match any profiles on the DNA database at the time. Ibrahim told police she had fought off her attackers with her hands, yet her lawyers assert that her bloodstained ring was not tested for DNA, despite one of the officers writing in their notebook that this should be done. Ibrahim says she was later told the ring had been lost and it formed no part of the court case.

Her shoes and leggings were also not tested for DNA, according to her legal team. In their submission to the review commission, they note: “There can be little worse than suffering an attack of this nature and then being disbelieved, prosecuted and imprisoned. If Ms Ibrahim’s account is true (and, for the avoidance of doubt, we believe that it is) the injustice of her wrongful conviction is one of the most serious failures of the criminal justice system in recent times. We would ask you to note that our client has now served her sentence and has been released – this is not an attempt to appeal by a person seeking release from custody, but by a person seeking justice.”

The CCRC has the power to send cases to the appeal courts if its experts think there is a real possibility that appeal judges will quash a conviction or change a sentence. Usually the CCRC only considers cases where someone has already tried to appeal, unless there are “exceptional circumstances”.

Ibrahim did not appeal while in prison, claiming her barrister told her there was no point. She was also preoccupied inside with being a first-time mother, after her daughter was born in August 2010.

Her lawyers believe her circumstances are exceptional, because her name could be cleared with fresh evidence they cannot obtain but which may fall within the CCRC’s special investigative and information gathering remit.

Her solicitor, Nigel Richardson, from Hodge Jones and Allen, argues that three local suspects were not investigated thoroughly. “More information about these suspects – namely their involvement in other sexual assaults – has come to light since the conviction. This information demands further scrutiny and investigation,” he writes in the submissions.

One possible suspect was a paranoid schizophrenic from the local area. Shortly after Ibrahim claims she was attacked, a 25-year-old man was jailed for grabbing and violently raping a woman. According to Thompson, by the time the man was arrested for that crime, Cumbria police were no longer investigating Ibrahim’s rape, having decided she had made it all up.

Yet Ibrahim insists the efit she provided to police bears a “striking” resemblance. The manner of his attack also bears the same hallmarks as her own.

Unused evidence bundles from the trial have yielded witness statements from members of the public who reported men seen the area at the time of the attack. Their descriptions matched those given by Ibrahim yet were not followed up by police.

During Ibrahim’s trial in the summer of 2010, no real motive was offered by the crown. In his draft opening note, the prosecuting barrister, Tim Evans, makes reference to a text conversation Ibrahim had with her ex-boyfriend a few hours before the attack. The ex “fobbed her off”, Evans told the jury. In the judge’s summing up there was also mention of an argument over a tomato sandwich with her ex a few days before the attack.

Evans also suggested she was cross because her friends refused to share a taxi home with her. A year after the incident, one of those friends, Richard Dent, told police he remembered her saying, shortly before walking home, “what would you do if something happened to us?” According to Ibrahim’s lawyers, Dent sent texts to her saying the police had pressed him and her ex to make her look bad in their statements.

Opening the case, Evans suggested Ibrahim may have faked the attack in order to teach Dent and her ex “a lesson” and gain some sympathy. Much emphasis was placed on inconsistencies in her evidence – perhaps unsurprising considering she had been drinking on the night in question and claimed to have been knocked out during the attack. The prosecution also said that clumps of her hair were found too far away from where she claimed to have been attacked, suggesting she cut her own hair, as well as her dress, on her way home.

Almost eight years on from that night Ibrahim is now happily married with three children. But she remains furious at what she insists was her wrongful conviction. “This is my life,” she said. “This has ruined my life.”

She said she was speaking out to raise awareness of others prosecuted for making false rape allegations – figures compiled by campaigners in 2014 suggested 109 women had been in that position in the previous five years. “I want people to understand that this does happen. One day it could be your sister, your aunty or your cousin being told by a judge that they have ‘wickedly fabricated a grave crime’,” she said.

“I know deep down that one day my name will be cleared. There will be some way to clear my name. My kids deserve that too. That’s all that matters to me,” she said, insisting she had no interest in compensation. “There’s no money in the world that would justify what happened to me.”

Her application to the review commission is being supported by Women Against Rape. Director Lisa Longstaff said in her submission: “It is our considered view that a number of miscarriages of justice have resulted from negligent and biased investigations into the original rape complaints. Ms Ibrahim’s is such a case. We believe that her conviction is unsafe and should be quashed, and that there should be a new investigation so the men who attacked her can be brought to justice and stopped from attacking others.”

Godwin’s Law does not apply in dangerous times. If you want to hear echoes of today’s threats against liberal democracy, turn to Nazi Germany. It denounced everyone, from Germans who sympathised with Jews to the “clique of criminals” in the army who failed to assassinate Hitler, as Volksverräter. In the Soviet Union, from Lenin via Stalin to the fall of communism, the same sentiment found a different expression. The millions who failed to please the glorious socialist motherland were vrag naroda, who deserved exile and death in Siberia for the sabotaging the workers’ paradise.

The English translation of Volksverräter and vrag naroda is “enemies of the people”, which was how the Daily Mail described three judges, who decided that the law required the prime minister to seek the approval of parliament before triggering Brexit. “The most fundamental rule of the UK constitution is that parliament is sovereign,” they said. It was hardly a controversial argument. Britain had fought civil wars in the 17th century to make the point clear, after all.

For this assertion of a fundamental conservative principle, the Mail said the judges were the enemies of the people, the Telegraph said they were frustrating the will of the people and the Sun said they were a “loaded foreign elite” defying the will of “Brit voters”.

It is true but still not accurate enough to say the British right is on the rampage for the first time since Margaret Thatcher’s day. (Those too young to remember Thatcher will soon learn why you should must never allow the right out of its cage.) But the analogy does not hold. The Thatcher generation of conservatives subscribed to a comforting story about Britain that was not wholly a lie. Unlike the continentals, it ran, the sensible British did not have the guillotines of the French Revolution or the terrors of Nazi Germany and communist Russia. We believed in gradual change, the rule of law, the independence of the judiciary and the sovereignty of parliament, not totalitarian theories with genocidal consequences.

You cannot say the same about the new demagogic right now in power. When checks and balances stand in its way, it wants to smash them in the name of “the people”. To escape the Europe of the present, it is reviving the language of the Europe of the past.

If the judges had tried to overturn the referendum result, or parliament was threatening to keep us in the EU, you could at least excuse them.

But the court merely said Theresa May had no power to implement one of the most complicated tasks modern Britain has attempted without the authority of the sovereign legislature.

You might object that I am building a grand theory on a few press cuttings. But the Tory leadership was as keen on denying the rule of law as the Tory tabloids. May and her justice secretary had to be forced to defend the judges even when the yobs of Ukip demanded their dismissal. Stephen Phillips, one of May’s own MPs, who supported Britain leaving the EU, incidentally, could nevertheless smell the faint but sharp stink of Putinism coming from Downing Street. He resigned, saying that May and her ministers think they “can do what the hell they like without asking parliament”.

Look around the world and everywhere you see the name of the “people” being used to insulate over-mighty states from dissent. Putin’s mobbish henchman in Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov, has called for a revival of the communist-era denunciation of vrag naroda. For him, the people’s enemies were Russia’s handful of independent politicians. He wanted them put on trial “with maximum severity, for sabotage”.

In Poland, the authoritarians in the Catholic nationalist Law and Justice government dismiss those who protest at their attacks on constitutional freedoms as traitors, German stooges and “gorszy sort Polaka” – the worst type of Pole. Meanwhile, Donald Trump is so convinced the people will vote for him that he has said in advance that his defeat at the polls could only be the result of fraud by the people’s enemies.

You can now read thousands of analyses of how the new right is sweeping western democracies. Journalists, political scientists, sociologists and economists have written with care about the pessimism and xenophobia of the left behind and the power lusts of the leaders of the radical-right middle class. Welcome, though their thoughts are, they habitually fail to offer any idea of how to fight back. Like the analyses of the crisis of the left, or the crisis of social democracy that preceded them, discussions of the crisis of liberalism are long on description and short on prescription.

I accept that in Britain, where the Labour party has perpetrated the most irresponsible act in its history by throwing itself into sectarian irrelevance, the task of organising resistance appears impossible. A start can be made, however, by twisting your knife into the cracks between the “elite” and “the people”.

By definition, the elite is composed of the men and women in power. May proves her elitism by thinking that she can govern like a monarch – Queen Theresa I. And yet she, her ministers and the Tory press think they can pose as the people’s friends. As with Putin, trying to squeeze funds for his wars from Russia’s arthritic economy, or Trump, preferring wild lies to the truth that he may be a loser, Tory authoritarianism conceals insecurity. Even a prime minister as unprepared as May knows Brexit will be horrendously difficult.

She and her supporters are turning on anyone who might point out the difficulties: the governor of the Bank of England, the chancellor, the judges and a phantom “liberal elite” that is so far from being an elite it is out of power. Their punishment beatings are warnings to MPs and peers of what will happen to them if they ask hard question. Their cries of victimhood are the beginnings of the new right’s stab-in-the-back myth that one day will blame all the problems of Brexit on everyone but them.

Tony Blair has not always had the closest of relations with the truth, but he was fair and accurate when he said of the right’s opponents, “we are the insurgents now”. At the referendum, the Brexiters were not the “voice of the people” but the voice of 52% of the people. As that small majority vanishes, as the costs mount and the complexities drag on year after year until the country becomes sick of hearing about them, be ready to ask the oldest question in politics: in whose name are you doing this to us? Not the people’s, surely?

The lord chancellor, Liz Truss, has broken her silence on the high court’s Brexit ruling, saying the independence of the judiciary was the “foundation upon which our rule of law is built”.



Truss had come under pressure from barristers to condemn the “serious and unjustified” attacks on judges in the wake of the article 50 ruling on Thursday.

She said on Saturday: “The independence of the judiciary is the foundation upon which our rule of law is built and our judiciary is rightly respected the world over for its independence and impartiality. In relation to the case heard in the high court, the government has made it clear it will appeal to the supreme court. Legal process must be followed.”

The shadow justice secretary, Richard Burgon, condemned Truss for failing to adequately stand up for the three judges who ruled against the government. “All Liz Truss has done is recite the well-known principle of the independence of the judiciary. [She] has still failed to condemn these attacks on the British judiciary as being ‘enemies of the people’ and talk in the press of the sexuality of a judge,” he said.

“I’m afraid that it’s far too little, far too late from Liz Truss. The last few days mean that much of the legal community now has no confidence in the lord chancellor to fulfil her statutory duty to protect the independence of the British judiciary.”

Earlier in the day the Bar Council, which represents barristers in England and Wales, urged Truss to defend the judiciary from the febrile media coverage – the three judges were condemned as “enemies of the people” by the Daily Mail – which former ministers said was poisoning public debate.

Chantal-Aimee Doerries QC, the Bar Council’s chair, emphasised that the judgment was not about the merits of leaving the EU, but rather the constitutional process of triggering article 50.

“It is the judiciary’s role to ensure the rule of law underpins our democratic system. Without it fulfilling this vital role, the people would have very limited scope to hold the government in power to account,” she said.

“Publicly criticising individual members of the judiciary over a particular judgment or suggesting that they are motivated by their individual views, political or otherwise, is wrong, and serves only to undermine their vital role in the administration of justice. It also does no favours to our global reputation.

“None of the parties suggested that the court did not have jurisdiction to decide the point at issue. They are simply doing their job – impartially ruling on a dispute between parties, one of whom happens to be the government in this instance.

“The right to appeal is there to challenge the court’s decision if a party feels they have grounds to do so. Whilst acknowledging that this question is one of potentially significant constitutional importance, the independent role of the court should be respected, particularly by those who disagree with the outcome.”

Politicians from all sides have condemned the attacks on the judiciary, which the former attorney general Dominic Grieve said were “chilling and outrageous” and “smacking of the fascist state”.



Hilary Benn, the Labour chair of the Commons Brexit select committee, said coverage such as the Mail’s was not helpful. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that the media and politicians had a responsibility not to attack those who had made the decision.

Ministers should remind their colleagues “that even if you don’t like the judgment, you have to respect it”, he said.

Bob Neill, the Conservative chairman of the justice select committee, said the attacks were “threatening the independence of our judiciary” and had “no place in a civilised land”.

Meanwhile, Jeremy Corbyn avoided questions about whether he would welcome an early election and accused the media of harassing him. In a speech to a leftwing thinktank in London on Saturday, the Labour leader said the prime minister must set out her Brexit negotiating terms to parliament without delay in the wake of the high court ruling.

“We accept and respect the decision to leave the European Union. But there must be transparency and accountability to parliament about the government’s plans,” Corbyn said. “I suspect the government opposes democratic scrutiny of its plans because – frankly – there aren’t any plans beyond the hollow rhetoric of ‘Brexit means Brexit’.”

Thursday’s legal ruling, which was followed by the resignation of the Tory MP Stephen Phillips, has fuelled speculation that May will seek a general election before 2020.

Corbyn refused to say whether he would be happy if there was an early election when asked by ITV. As aides intervened to stop further questions from the media, Corbyn walked away saying: “Can we go outside because we are being harassed here?”

A woman who had accused Donald Trump of raping her when she was a 13-year-old dropped her lawsuit against the Republican nominee on Friday.

One of the accuser’s attorneys, Thomas Meagher, filed a one-page voluntary dismissal in district court in New York late on Friday. Neither he nor a second attorney listed immediately responded to questions about the document.

The woman, who had filed suit earlier this year under the pseudonym Jane Doe, had alleged that Trump and billionaire Jeffrey Epstein had raped her in 1994, when she was a 13-year-old aspiring model.

This week she abruptly canceled a plan to speak publicly about the allegations, and another attorney, Lisa Bloom, cited “numerous threats” against her client.

“She has been here all day, ready to do it, but unfortunately she is in terrible fear,” Bloom said on Wednesday. Bloom’s mother, Gloria Allred, is an attorney representing several women who have accused Trump of sexual misconduct.

Trump had been given a tentative court date for the civil lawsuit of 16 December and has denied all the accusations made against him.

After Doe’s suit was filed in June, Alan Garten, a lawyer for the Trump Organization, told the Guardian the claims were “a complete fabrication”.

“This is basically a sham lawsuit brought by someone who desires to impact the presidential election,” he said.

A virtually identical lawsuit was filed in April in California and dismissed for technical errors. An investigation linked the lawsuits to Norm Lubow, a former television producer with a history of disputed allegations against celebrities. Both suits named Epstein, a financier who was convicted of soliciting sex from an underage girl in 2008.

The court order to Trump and Epstein’s attorneys gave no details of Doe’s complaint, but the original suit alleged that Trump assaulted her at Epstein’s home in Manhattan and at parties hosted by the financier.

The finding that Rolling Stone magazine defamed a University of Virginia administrator is the latest in a series of legal decisions that experts say signal a hardening attitude to the media and other institutions.

A jury on Friday found that Rolling Stone and writer Sabrina Rudin Erdely met the extraordinary standard of acting with “actual malice” in their depictions of Nicole Eramo, the university’s former associate dean.

In her lawsuit for $7.5m, Eramo claimed the publication’s story cast her as the “chief villain” who “silenced” Jackie or “discouraged” her from reporting her alleged rape to police.

The story published in November 2014 told the story of a University of Virginia student identified only as “Jackie” who claimed that seven members of Phi Kappa Psi raped her in a gruesome fraternity initiation. The story initially spurred an outpouring of outrage until it fell apart under scrutiny from other news outlets. Within weeks, Rolling Stone had to apologize for not thoroughly fact-checking it.

Jurors in this case had to find that the magazine’s reporter and editors not only made a mistake but had knowledge of the falsity or reckless disregard for the truth.

“It has to be egregious,” said Samantha Barbas, a law professor specializing in media at the University at Buffalo. “The press has to know that something is false and print it anyway.”

The verdict comes on the heels of several recent high-profile cases where juries have found against institutions in cases involving invasion or privacy or defamation issues.

Last month the News & Observer of Raleigh was ordered to pay about $6m in a state bureau of investigation agent’s libel lawsuit.

Earlier this year a jury in St Petersburg, Florida, delivered a $115m verdict against Gawker Media after it posted a sex tape of Hulk Hogan with his best friend’s wife. The verdict forced the sale of the company, and last week Hogan and Gawker’s former owners settled for $31m – but not before the now-defunct site filed for bankruptcy.

A month earlier, US sportscaster Erin Andrews was awarded $55m against Marriott Hotels after a Tennessee jury found the chain had not protected her from being filmed in the shower by a stalker.

Barbas argued that the series of decisions signal that juries, reflecting public sentiment, are “disenchanted with freedom of speech” since many had personally experienced, through social media, the damage that online speech can have.

“We’ve entered an anti-media cycle and we’re seeing people, particularly public figures, getting a lot more litigious about what appears in the media, whether that’s libel or invasion of privacy.” At the same time, Barbas said, “Public figures are becoming more confident juries will be more sympathetic to them.”

Unlike the Gawker case, which claimed invasion of privacy, Eramo sued the magazine for allegedly casting her as the “chief villain” in its article. Because the judge ruled that Eramo was a “limited-purpose” public figure, she couldn’t simply claim that Rolling Stone was negligent in its reporting – she had to argue that the publication acted with “actual malice”.

While Rolling Stone went to great lengths to unpick the failures of its reporting and fact-checking, including commissioning a report from the Columbia School of Journalism, it did not retract its characterization of Eramo.

Mary-Rose Papandrea, a University of North Carolina law professor, said the greatest surprise in the case was that “there wasn’t a greater awareness to the high risk of litigation”.

“This can only happen when journalists are too trusting in their sources and seemed to be hiding their heads in the sand to the truthfulness of what they’re publishing,” Papandrea said.

In finding Rolling Stone liable, jurors accepted Eramo’s claim that Erdely, the reporter, acted with actual malice on six claims – two statements in the article and four statements to media outlets after the story’s publication. Barbas said the statements in the original article went from being inaccurate to libelous when Rolling Stone republished the article with corrections.

“Rolling Stone knew that Jackie was not a credible source yet despite that they published the story and let it stay on their website. They reaffirmed the truth of it despite, by that point, having serious doubts about Jackie’s credibility. So that was enough to constitute actual malice.”

In one objectionable statement, Erdely wrote that Eramo had a “nonreaction” when she heard from Jackie that two other women were also raped at the same fraternity. Another was Erdely’s statement to the Washington Post days after the story was published that the University of Virginia administration chose not to act on Jackie’s allegations “in any way”.

Barbas believes the consequences of this verdict could be farther-reaching than the Gawker verdict, which was based on the broadcast of a sex tape on a site known for sensationalistic or gossipy material.

“It’s not a sex tape, it’s reporting on a legitimate subject. For a jury to say there’s actual malice – a reckless disregard of the truth – is pretty strong and that’s why this may have a stronger impact on the media than the Gawker case.”

For Rolling Stone, once at the forefront of 60s social upheavals, the verdict will come as a bitter blow. Not only has its reputation suffered, but it still faces a $25m defamation lawsuit from the University of Virginia’s Phi Kappa Psi fraternity – where Jackie claimed her sexual assault took place. That case is set to go to trial next year.

A referendum being held alongside the US presidental election could result in the District of Columbia becoming the country’s 51st state.

Invoking the colonial-era demand of “no taxation without representation”, supporters say becoming a state would end Washingtonians’ status as second-class citizens because they lack representation in Congress. But opponents dismiss the referendum as a “fool’s errand” destined to fail because of partisan political hurdles and the need to amend the US constitution, a procedure accomplished only 17 times since 1789.

The District of Columbia was created to serve as the US capital, but is not a state. Its 672,000 residents pay federal taxes but have no voting representative in the Senate or House of Representatives although they pay federal taxes, though they do have a delegate in the House.

A yes vote on Tuesday could help pressure the new Congress and president – either Democrat Hillary Clinton or Republican Donald Trump – to admit the District of Columbia as a state, though even advocates admit that is unlikely anytime soon. A yes vote would simply be an expression of public support for statehood, a non-binding measure without any legal force.

“Statehood is the only way that we can have the same rights and responsibilities as all the other citizens of the United States,” the District of Columbia council chairman, Phil Mendelson, said.

The overwhelmingly Democratic capital city was, he said, fed up with Republican lawmakers espousing the rights of states and cities to self-governance and then interfering with local issues, such as abortion and marijuana legalisation. “That’s so antithetical to democratic principles, but that doesn’t seem to bother some of these folks.”

The referendum, the first to be held on the issue, seeks to upend the constitution’s provision giving Congress legislative control over the District of Columbia. Voters will cast a single yes or no vote on the referendum’s four parts: admission as a state, its boundaries, approval of a constitution and guarantees of a representative form of government.

The new state would embrace the current 68 sq mile (176 sq km) district except for a core of federal property around the White House, Capitol and monument-rich National Mall.

The district council approved the referendum unanimously, and a Washington Post poll in November 2015 showed 67% of residents backed statehood. The Democratic party’s national platform also supports the idea.

“If you’re not part of a state, large parts of the constitution don’t apply to you,” said statehood advocate Ann Loikow.

The mayor, Muriel Bowser, and other statehood supporters took the vote’s design from the successful bid in the 1790s by Tennessee, then a federal territory, to become a state through a referendum and petition to Congress.

Supporters and sceptics alike have said that even if the referendum passed it would face a dead end in Congress, where Republicans would oppose statehood since it would add Democratic senators and a representative to Congress.

Roger Pilon, of the libertarian Cato Institute, called the statehood quest a “fool’s errand” because of constitutional obstacles.

For the district to become a state, Congress would have to propose an amendment to the constitution, which would then have to win a two-thirds majority vote in both the Senate and the House. Even if an amendment could win approval in both houses of Congress, it would face another big hurdle: approval by the legislatures of at least three-quarters of the 50 states.

Washingtonians have tried to achieve statehood before, but never by a referendum. Congress ignored a statehood petition that included a constitution voters ratified in the 1980s. The House of Representatives rejected a statehood bill in 1993, and it failed to reach a Senate vote. A constitutional amendment for voting rights in Congress fizzled in the 1980s.

‘Molly”, “Uranian”, “intermediate type”, “LGBT”. The changing words used by gay people to describe each other can be read as a kind of history in themselves. Their evolution from social to psychological to political categories mirrors changes in the real-life experience of sexual nonconformity. Side by side are the insults thrown by the majority: “sodomite”, “queer”, “invert”, “degenerate”, some of which betray the influence of prevailing religious or medical attitudes. As ever, culture leaves its imprint on language. So where are we now? Is “LGBTQQI” the natural end point in a story of emancipation, where everyone is free to express their sexuality and identity as they like?

Coming Out by Jeffrey Weeks tries to take the long view. A “history of LGBT identities in Britain from the 19th century to the present”, it was first published in 1977, in a decade when Dennis Altman prophesied “the end of the homosexual” – a world where being gay or straight wouldn’t matter. A second edition in 1990 took in the Aids crisis, and this version, with a new foreword and postscript, brings us up to date.

The action begins in the late 19th century, with an unprecedented entwining of law and sexual morality. It’s hard to be certain why this happened: Weeks offers up the “grappling for control” by central government in an era of mass urbanisation, industrial capitalism and potential disorder. The professionalisation of policing was another factor. Whatever the causes, gay men (the law ignored lesbians) faced unprecedented dangers. The Labouchère amendment to the 1885 Criminal Law Act introduced the offence of gross indecency, punishable by hard labour. It did for both Oscar Wilde and, 50 years later, Alan Turing. It was on the statute books until 2003.

In this context, the life and work of someone such as Edward Carpenter is extraordinary. Born in 1844 in comfortable circumstances in Brighton, he had become, by the 1890s, a radical socialist, gay mystic, a “prophet” to some, with poetry, political writings and countless public speeches to his name. Weeks describes how the cottage in Derbyshire where he lived with his working-class boyfriend, George Merrill, became a mecca for “vegetarians, dress-reformers, temperance orators, spiritualists, secularists, anti-vivisectionists”. A former lover, George Hukin, recounts that one day “two very pretty young ladies turned up with a donkey and cart and a dog. They had come all the way from Essex with bare feet and sandals … they said they were pilgrims”.

While providing a model for gay life, and alluding to it in unmistakable ways in his writing, Carpenter had to be circumspect. He trod a careful line in a response to reviews of his 1908 book The Intermediate Sex: A Study of Some Transitional Types of Men and Women: “I am certain there is not a single passage … where I advocate sexual intercourse of any kind between those of the same sex. I advocate sincere attachment and warm friendship.”

Despite these limitations, Carpenter’s vision was influential in an era where most expressions of hope for sexual freedom were idealistic, literary or couched in scientific terms. He was part of a milieu that included the novelists EM Forster and Radclyffe Hall and the sexologist Havelock Ellis. As the century wore on, these currents gave way to more technocratic attempts to effect legislative change. The Homosexual Law Reform Society (HLRS) was founded in 1958, after the publication of the Wolfenden report, which recommended the decriminalisation of gay sex, but still a decade away from decriminalisation itself. As a project to convince parliament and society of the need for a new approach, it was respectable to a T. The HLRS argued that its mission was vital, “for reasons of justice, security, public health” – a slogan with nods to the risks of both blackmail and venereal disease. For now, the case for change had to be based on something other than “gay pride”.

The fact that, post-decriminalisation, prosecutions for gross indecency actually increased, combined with the example set by the Stonewall riots in New York in 1969, meant that as the 70s rolled in a new spirit of truculence emerged. With the formation of the Gay Liberation Front, some gay men and women decided to stop apologising for themselves, to abandon being as discreet and decorous as possible in order to win allies. Instead there were new forms of protest like rowdy “zappings”, which targeted homophobic institutions or people, “gay-ins” and pride marches. Though small in scale (Weeks says that around 2,000 attended the first gay pride march in 1971), it was a paradigm shift that probably had more effect on gay people’s sense of themselves than decades of quiet lobbying.

Weeks was an activist in the 70s, not merely an observer, and has been criticised as promoting a gay “end of history” argument – something that might look naive in the light of today’s proliferation of both freedom and reaction. He addresses this in the foreword: “Although I certainly believed that the new identities did represent an advance on the closeted and often persecuted identities that came before, I did not believe that there was anything automatic about their emergence – after all, this book is in large part a history of struggle, which by its nature goes in many, often divergent directions.” As for today’s alphabet soup of Qs and Gs and Is: “Nor did I think that lesbian and gay identities, themselves very varied, exhausted all other possibilities, and where we had got to in the 1970s was where we wanted to be.”

The book has its flaws. The sweep and ambition are impressive but the texture is uneven. The pre-1967 chapters comprise skilled, enjoyable history writing in a fairly conventional mould. By the 70s, however, Weeks’ own history in the gay liberation movement subtly directs his attention. A hurried look at the 80s, and the brevity of the more recent postscript add to a sense of lopsidedness.

More problematically, the short passages on attempts by advocates of child abuse to ally with the gay movement come across as too equivocal. Weeks writes, “Libertarians asked: if an encounter between a child and adult was consensual and mutually pleasurable, in what way could or should it be deemed harmful? This led on to questions of what constituted harm, what was consent … These were real questions which had to be faced if any rational approach was to emerge, but too often they were swept away in a tide of revulsion.” It is discomfiting that Weeks doesn’t make it clearer these arguments fail because no child can “consent” to sexual activity.

Despite the efforts to update it, Coming Out retains the flavour of a period piece, albeit a significant one. For a record of contemporary gay life, I suspect we’ll have to wait until those now making it are ready to commit their own histories to paper.

Judges' actions around the world show they are no enemy of the people

As Indonesia’s president, Joko “Jokowi” Widodo, touches down in Australia for the first time since assuming the presidency, will human rights feature at all in the talks? Indonesian officials are already working overtime to control the agenda, with the defence minister, Ryamizard Ryacudu, warning Australia against “interfering in the West Papua issue” and asking Australia to send a message to Pacific Island nations that support autonomy for Papuans.

Ryamizard told an Australian journalist, with no apparent irony: “Those countries better keep their mouths shut and mind their own business. It is better that Australia speaks to them gently. If it was left up to me, I would twist their ears.”

Although Australia has consistently supported Indonesian sovereignty over Papua, the issue remains one of various sensitivities in the Australia–Indonesia relationship. But that discomfort does not give Indonesia a free pass to commit human rights abuses in the province, nor should Australia shy away from discussing such matters at the highest levels.

The provinces of Papua and West Papua are a remote, isolated region, where the OPM (Free Papua Movement) has led a low-level insurgency for decades. That insurgency has long been the excuse for significant military involvement in Papua. With the heightened police and military presence, there have been reports of security force abuses including killings, torture, excessive or unnecessary use of force, and mistreatment of peaceful protesters.

At least 37 Papuans remain behind bars for peaceful acts of free expression or expressing solidarity with the independence movement. All of this impunity is aided by reduced scrutiny of abuses as foreign journalists and human rights organisations face a half century-long restriction on visiting the province.

Perhaps Indonesia feels especially confident in rallying Australian support, since it scored something of a coup in August with the Papua visit by the attorney general, George Brandis. He was the first Australian cabinet minister to visit Papua, and human rights were glaringly absent from all public statements he made about that visit. His choice of travelling companion was also troubling – he was accompanied by Wiranto, Indonesia’s poster child for impunity for serious abuses.

Wiranto, the co-ordinating minister for political, legal and security affairs, was Indonesia’s armed forces chief in 1999 when the military and government-backed militias carried out atrocities against the East Timorese after they voted for independence.

In fact, given that background, it’s even more important for the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, and foreign minister, Julie Bishop, to ask some hard questions about what Indonesia is doing to address human rights violations in Papua and how Australia can help.

Australian acceptance of Indonesian sovereignty over Papua does not mean discussion of human rights concerns in Papua should be taken off the table. Let’s remember that Jokowi himself has previously called for greater respect for human rights in Papua and for the Indonesian government to stop blocking foreign journalists and observers from visiting Papua.

Here’s one suggestion that Turnbull could broach with Jokowi: if Indonesian officials are so keen to gain Australia’s support on Papua, then why not allow a multi-party parliamentary delegation from Australia, accompanied by journalists, free access to visit the province?

Australia’s parliament has long had an interest in the region, with a Parliamentary Friends of West Papua group co-chaired by Jane Prentice MP and Senator Richard Di Natale. Such a visit, not a junket, should include a range of Australian politicians armed with expertise in trade, tourism, economic and social portfolios and include meetings with Papuan leaders, civil society, imprisoned activists and ordinary Papuans.

In fact, when General Luhut Pandjaitan, then coordinating minister for political, legal and security affairs, visited Canberra in June he extended an invitation to the Australian government to visit Papua, saying,

A visit would help Australian politicians understand more about a region only a few hundred kilometres to our north that remains isolated and undeveloped. It would enable Australians to hear directly from Papuans about the issues affecting their lives – surely this is part of what Jokowi wants in trying to win the hearts and minds of Papuans.

A Playboy model who used social media to shame a woman at her gym was charged with invasion of privacy by the Los Angeles city prosecutor on Friday, just three months after her Snapchat post mocked the 70-year-old.

The charge was filed against Dani Mathers, a 29-year-old model, on Friday afternoon for secretly photographing a naked woman at her gym “with the intent to invade the privacy of that other person”, according to the complaint.

In July Mathers shared the photo with thousands of followers on Snapchat, with the caption: “If I can’t unsee this, then you can’t either.”

Mathers eventually apologized in a video, saying the public posting was accidental: “That was absolutely wrong and not what I meant to do.”

“I know that body shaming is wrong,” she added. “That is not the type of person I am.”

The gym, LA Fitness, revoked her membership and banned her from all its locations. At the time its executive vice-president, Jill Greuling, called Mathers’ actions “appalling” and the gym reported the post to Los Angeles police, who said they began an investigation into “illegal distribution” of the photo.

“While body shaming, in itself, is not a crime,” city attorney Mike Feuer in a statement, “there are circumstances in which invading one’s privacy to accomplish it can be. And we shouldn’t tolerate it”.

“Body shaming is humiliating, with often painful, long-term consequences,” he added. “It mocks and stigmatizes its victims, tearing down self-respect and perpetuating the harmful idea that our unique physical appearances should be compared to air-brushed notions of ‘perfect’.”

Tom Mesereau, Mathers’ attorney, told the Guardian on Friday that his client never intended to violate privacy law. “I am very disappointed that Dani Mathers was charged with any violation,” he said in a statement. “She never tried to invade anyone’s privacy and never tried to break any law.”

Mathers faces up to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine for the misdemeanor count of invasion, and she is scheduled for arraignment on 28 November.

Earlier this year a California court ruled that a Snapchat secretly taken of a teenager, apparently masturbating in a bathroom stall, was an illegal invasion of privacy. Civil rights attorneys have largely agreed that, under California law, photography or filming without consent in a bathroom is a violation of the “reasonable expectation of privacy”.

Taking that photograph was “a flagrant violation of privacy law”, explained Danielle Keats Citron, a law professor at the University of Maryland who specializes in privacy and cyber law. “Naked in the bathroom – it’s uncontested.”

Like so many of the biggest formats in the golden era of reality TV, Brexit is set on an island. Back in the early years of the millennium, you were nothing in unscripted programming unless you were marooned on an island or in a McMansion, then forced to fight your way to the prize by scheming, screaming, demeaning, and not forgetting the lyrics to Dance with My Father. The transatlantic spirit of the age was Simon Cowell, a populist whose love of plebiscites did little to disguise his totalitarian ambition. When he declared, “No one is ever going to publish a book called Simon Cowell, My Struggle’’, I wept for the loss of the German edition.

The holy grail of reality formats was conflict, as orchestrated by cynical, unseen producers, who manipulated participants into degrading themselves and the public into voting – at financial cost – for the result. Absurd props and esoteric MacGuffins were spoken of as solemnly as if they were articles of a country’s constitution. Tribal Council. The Diary Room. Bushtucker Trials. The £350m Bus . Judges’ Houses. Unelected Judges’ Houses. Hang on – a couple of those have ended up in the wrong list. Still, you get the idea.

As any number of dystopian fictions from Rollerball to The Hunger Games have long warned us, the future is a televised contest played for the highest stakes. So we must have known the current shitshow was in the post. Either way, it turns out all those who used to tut, “How low can reality TV go?” were totally asking the wrong question. Look how high it’s gone! Never mind history repeating itself as farce – reality TV is repeating itself as history. On the other side of the Atlantic, arguably the biggest reality star of that golden era is currently the Republican nominee for the presidency. Over this side, to many narcotised by two decades of the genre, the uncomplicated certainties of its voting are regarded as less of a conspiracy than judicial process.

With the exception of X Factor, where the hostility was more covert, reality TV voting was always disapproval voting. You voted off. You voted out. And that was that. A significant section of the population believe the EU was voted off on 23 June, and now are beginning to openly dismiss the rule of law, as though it were Jedward, or a Survivor contestant who disparaged the Ulong tribe’s plans for a shelter with an awesome sex crib attached. Who does Cayla even think she is? What even is the rule of law? Who made it queen of everything? Tory MP David Davies doesn’t believe in it; half the papers don’t believe in it; others have already taken their lead without encouragement. Maybe the rule of law’s “journey” on the show has come to an end, and we should crank up Everybody Hurts and bid it farewell with a montage of its best bits.

Today’s Daily Express front page likened the “threat” of a high court ruling on the triggering of article 50 to that of Hitler. Guys – if you hate Hitler so much, stop publishing front pages that read like future exhibits in a museum show called Before the Militias. The second most WTF-laden intro was in the Daily Mail, which assigned ark-of-the-covenant-like qualities to a leaflet whose only prior claim to fame was being dismissed as a biased disgrace in the Daily Mail. As Friday’s paper had it: “MPs last night accused judges of failing to read the £9m taxpayer-funded publicity leaflet that stated the referendum result would be followed directly by ministers.” Wait – MPs accused judges of failing to read a leaflet? Did they also accuse them of failing to follow the rules of Bootcamp? Can we settle this with an immunity task/a sing-off in the karaokosseum/ a catfight between the leaflet and the bus? Also: didn’t the Daily Mail watch the shows? The mean judge is always a Brit – and in this case, there are three of them. Can’t at least one of these leaflet-shunners be replaced by X Factor judge – and Brexiteer – Sharon Osbourne?

Having banged on about their failure to remotely understand what they were asking for at the time, I do have to offer another slow handclap for the generation of politicians such as Gordon Brown – a man so obsessed with the X Factor that he once wrote personal letters to the finalists – who were forever on about wanting “an X Factor politics”. Newsflash, Gordon: this is what X Factor politics looks like. Try not to choke on it!

Now his ratings are on the slide, Cowell can at least take comfort that his plan to “give politics the X Factor” has come to pass. “The fact we’re allowing the public to make the decisions most of the time is a really good thing,” Cowell once mused of his various shows. “The great thing is when you start seeing it in places like China and Afghanistan. It’s democracy. We’ve kinda given democracy back to the world.” Man, he had it all figured out, didn’t he? A bit like his best mate Philip Green – whose report into government efficiency concluded that running the vast and complex machinery of the state was akin to retail – Cowell’s reputation as a man with the answer to everything is likely to oxidise rapidly.

At one stage he punted the idea of a TV show where the public voted every week on a political issue – and perhaps Simon passed on this faith in frequent referendums to David Cameron, whom he backed in a major Sun splash on the eve of the 2010 election. Cameron, he reckoned, was a man of “substance” with “the stomach to navigate us through difficult times”.

In the end, it’s amazing – considering how histrionic and uncivilised many found it at the time – quite how rule-abiding and righteous reality TV now looks compared to actual reality. There were parameters on the shows, even on many of the ghastlier ones. I mean, at least soundstages were frequently equipped with lie detectors. Imagine how much better this US election would have been with a polygraph. Imagine how much better the referendum campaign would have been with a polygraph. Imagine how much better both would have been if politicians had been bleeped and called into the producers when they said something racist.

Please don’t take all this as the view from above. It is hardly a matter of pride, but I suspect I am as unwittingly, hopelessly addicted to the horrifyingly debased dramas of today’s politics as many others. I used to watch lots of reality shows, but they haven’t done it for me for years now. Maybe the hit I used to get off their dramas and conflicts – was it dopamine? – requires a bigger stimulus. In the mad fever dream of the US election and the increasingly frightening divisions of Brexit, both amplified by social media, maybe I and countless others have found it. This used to be the way we watched. Now it’s the way we seek to govern; the way we govern; the way we live.

The rule of law is the bedrock of a democratic society. It can check corruption and abuses of power. It permits individuals to order their lives. It allows private corporations, public bodies and the executive to regulate effectively their own activities. If the rule of law is to be upheld, it is vital that there should be an independent judiciary. This fact appears lost on Brexiter rabble-rousers. This voluble, influential political sect has unleashed gales of fury on the high court judges who ruled that only parliament has the authority to trigger article 50 of the Treaty on European Union, the legal route for Britain to leave the EU. Leading the charge are rightwing newspapers, which claim themselves to be champions of free speech and traditional British liberties. Yet since the Brexit vote they have sought to delegitimise their opponents’ views and silence them through intimidation. This morning these newspapers laced racial innuendo with accusations of treachery, casting themselves as representatives of the people against unelected “out of touch” judges and their “loaded foreign elite” remainer acolytes.

This is rhetoric that goes beyond character assassination and rightwing posturing into something darker and more dangerous. Remember, we are only months away from the gunning down of a pro-remain MP in broad daylight. During the course of this case, the bench – headed by the lord chief justice – was compelled to remind the gallery that threats against the claimants would be taken as contempt of court. The hysterical, and frankly ludicrous, response to the ruling was to claim that the judges’ decision had sparked a crisis akin to that faced by Winston Churchill during world war two when he called on Britons to “fight them on the beaches”. This intolerance threatens to undermine political freedom and judicial independence. No court is infallible. One can dissent from judgments without trying, via newsprint and social media, to shatter a nation’s confidence in judges as impartial guardians of the rule of law. Judges don’t do opinions unless they are legal ones. Hence the need for politicians to speak up.

So we ask: where is the prime minister in all this? Has she lost sight of the obvious – that the rule of law requires that the courts have jurisdiction to scrutinise the actions of government to ensure that they are lawful? Where, pray, is the lord chancellor, Liz Truss, who – as former office-bearer Charles Falconer notes – has a constitutional duty to defend the judges? The government will have its appeal heard in the supreme court next month. Unless ministers make clear their support for the judiciary, it looks as if the government is colluding to try to cow the highest courts in the land. The high court used Jacobean case law – “the King by his proclamation or other ways cannot change any part of the common law, or statute law, or the customs of the realm” – to spike the government case that ministers have a right to invoke article 50 under the royal prerogative. The citizen must be able to challenge the executive before an independent judiciary. Because it is the executive that exercises the power of the state and because it is the executive which is a frequent litigator in the courts, it is from executive pressure or influence that judges require particularly to be protected. By standing by, ministers are encouraging mobocracy to overwhelm the rule of law.

Now the members of the demagogic right are demonstrating that they are not only a threat to our economic wellbeing but our constitutional settlement (Scotland weighs up whether to join in article 50 legal fight, 4 November). When Nigel Farage threatens those parliamentarians who delay or block Brexit with public anger (which he will do his best to provoke), he is denying parliament the right to hold the executive to account. He has no understanding of the role of the MP as the representative of the people and not its delegate (as defined by Edmund Burke) which until now was regarded as the correct understanding of the role of the MP. Britain is a representative or parliamentary democracy, not one ruled by plebiscite which is more characteristic of authoritarian states, such as Hitler’s Third Reich.

When Ukip’s Suzanne Evans demands the sacking of the judges, she is undermining the independence of the judiciary, yet another of the bulwarks intended to prevent the arbitrary exercise  of power by governments. Politicians such as these when they speak of the will of the people are using it as a means of removing from the constitution all those elements that they don’t like, in particular those that protect the rights of minorities, in this case the 48% who voted remain. The Brexit debate is no longer just a debate on EU membership but a fight to retain those elements of the British constitution that make it a liberal democracy.

• The Burkean philosophy quoted by your correspondent (Letters 3 November) is the root of arrogance and self-righteousness of some members of parliament. Burke’s flowery language can be reduced to ignoring your constituents’ wishes if they do not accord with the representative’s enlightened conscience entrusted by providence. Messianic zeal should have no place in a secular society.

• The death threats made to Gina Miller are both scandalous and extremely worrying coming so soon after the tragic death of Jo Cox. Such scurrilous comments, bordering on xenophobia, should be refuted by our free press and not encouraged as we have seen from the rightwing press, describing the high court judges who ruled in the article 50 case as “the enemies of the people”. Upholding the rule of law is at the cornerstone of our democracy and the judges involved have done just that. The true “enemies of the people” are those who rail so provocatively against them.

George Longstaff

Bidford-on-Avon

• The argument about whether parliament or the prime minister should trigger article 50 clouds another issue: that article 50 is impossible to use. Under article 50, the other 27 member states can present an ultimatum, since the UK’s membership will automatically cease after two years. Worse, even if a compromise is reached, it has to be approved by the European parliament. If MEPs reject the agreement, the UK will still have to leave. Thus, the 27 cannot credibly commit. The setup imposed by article 50 makes negotiation impossible. Invoking article 50 is close to unconditional surrender before negotiations have begun.

Hopefully, parliament will have sense enough to see the futility of negotiating without any leverage and rule out the use of article 50. And hopefully, EU leaders and leaders of other member states will realise that their commitment not to negotiate before article 50 is invoked is not credible. A deal has to be struck, and it is pointless to demand that the UK surrenders all weapons before the fight has even begun.

Brexit can mean anything. Just as the British crown has all sorts of arrangements with its various affiliated nations – the constituent nations of Great Britain, Northern Ireland, crown dependencies, etc – so can the EU have a variety of arrangements with the UK, possibly with special provisions for Scotland. This needs to be achieved by a treaty change or by some other means, instead of through the unusable article 50.

• Steve Flatley (Letters, 3 November) suggests, perhaps tongue in cheek, that the government could appeal to the European court if they lose their article 50 case in the supreme court. I can’t see that it’s been pointed out yet that the supreme court must refer the case. The reasoning of the high court in deciding that the crown prerogative cannot be used proceeded from the initial assumption, agreed by the parties to the case as “common ground”, that notice of withdrawal under article 50 cannot be revoked. This is a matter of interpretation of article 50, and as the final court of appeal, the supreme court will be obliged to refer the case to the European court of justice under Article 267 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU.

• What a shambles. Cameron takes a bill to parliament to have a referendum he expects to vote remain to see off Ukip. The entire scrutiny process of the passage of the bill fails to ask whether this is our MPs’ last say in the matter. So now our learned friends are making a pretty penny at our expense sorting out what I thought we paid our MPs to do. The only good thing is Nigel Farage being so cross that a British court has made a decision.

John Beer

• The day after Sir John Chilcot, before a parliamentary committee, criticised Tony Blair because on several occasions between 2002 and 2007 “things were decided without reference to cabinet”, the high court rules that government does not have the power it claimed to trigger article 50 without consulting parliament. Prime ministers should not have to be told these things.

Adrian Betham

• The government should accept that parliament must have the right to debate and vote on the outcome of Brexit negotiations once these have been conducted. Conversely parliament should accept that the government is obliged to trigger those negotiations and that in doing so it is taking its instructions from the people.

• I am a pro-European. My issue with the court judgment is thus more one of efficiency than principle. International negotiations are complex and thus can only be a crown prerogative. On that same principle the deployment of British forces can only be a crown prerogative as parliamentary involvement can only forewarn those on the other side, like Isis terrorists.

The Brexit-supporting press has mounted a vicious assault on the three high court judges who ruled in the article 50 case. And it has undermined our constitution in the process. The government appears to be fuelling this attack. Sajid Javid, the local government secretary, described the judges as seeking to “thwart the will of the people”.

The judiciary is a pillar of our constitution. Allow faith in the judges to be eroded and that pillar is eroded at a huge cost to our freedoms.

The front page of the Daily Mail labelled the three judges “enemies of the people”. It described Sir Terence Etherton as the first “openly gay” judge, detailed Sir Philip Sales’ earnings when he was a barrister and worked for the government and captioned a photograph of the third judge “The Europhile: Lord Chief Justice Thomas”. The Sun and the Daily Telegraph stooped to spraying abuse with the same lack of concern for the constitutional place of the judiciary in our democracy.

Our judges do not do politics. They do law. They are selected to be judges on their legal ability. Their political allegiance is irrelevant and plays no part in their selection – which is not, for example, the case in the US. The judges of the American supreme court, when confronted with the choice of Al Gore or George Bush in the 2000 election, which was contested in the courts, each came down on the side of the party that had nominated them. So Bush won because there were more Republican-nominated judges than Democratic. One of the things that has made the UK such a strong player in the global economy is that politics does not affect the rule of law or the decisions of our courts. This attracts business to the UK, because people know court rulings will not be influenced by politics.

The British public continues to have confidence in the independence and quality of judges. But both are undermined by this Brexit-inspired media vitriol. The attitude of the Brexiters seems to be: who cares about constitutional protections such as that which prevents the executive from just removing people’s rights on the prime minister’s say-so, and undermining casually the authority of judges? It is intensely damaging and sets up yet another conflict: judges against the people.

We must leave the EU in accordance with the referendum vote. But we must take care not to damage our constitutional framework in the process. Democracy and the rule of law are the two pillars of our constitution.

There is very little doubt, when you read this judgment, that the judges have loyally obeyed their judicial oath and decided the case in accordance with the law and the facts. The principle that citizens have legal rights that cannot be taken away on the say-so of the executive without parliamentary authority was not in dispute. The question the judges had to decide was the extent to which rights given by the European Communities Act of 1972 were an exception to that principle. The court concluded unsurprisingly that these rights, which had been incorporated into our domestic law, weren’t an exception, and they cited previous cases stretching back decades, which made that clear. The ruling did not say there should be no Brexit or that Brexit should be delayed, but that Brexit must be done constitutionally not unconstitutionally. As a piece of legal reasoning it is firmly rooted both in accepted principle and decided cases. The decision reaffirms well known principles and applies them to Brexit in an authoritative way.

Yet the quality and impartiality of the judgment appears to cut no ice with either the Brexit media or some elements of the government. We trust our judges to uphold the law and the constitution impartially. This impartiality depends on judges not expressing views, so they can’t defend themselves. That’s why the government has an obligation to defend them and why the constitution places a duty on the lord chancellor to do so.

The government needs to make it clear that they dissociate themselves from these attacks and come to the defence of the judges. Ministers need to make it clear that they do not doubt for one minute either the integrity of the three judges, or that the judges have given what they believe to be the correct answer.

They should make it clear that the judges have in no way acted undemocratically or in opposition to the people, and that attacks on their integrity and attempts to undermine them personally are factually unfounded and undermine our country.

There is a world of difference between judicial decisions that have political consequences, as this one does, and decisions that are motivated by wanting a political outcome – which this one is not. To create a sense that the government is at odds with the judiciary and that judges are somehow in a different political camp from the government is both wrong and damaging.

The lord chancellor, Liz Truss, has a constitutional duty to defend the judges. She needs to make it clear immediately that the government has no quarrel with the judges and has total confidence in them. Disagreement with the judges is dealt with by appeal not by abuse. So far Truss has been completely silent, no doubt waiting for guidance from a prime minister who appears so mesmerised by the fear of what the public may do or think that she is willing to throw constitutional propriety overboard.

Truss’s silence feeds the sense that the government is either hopeless at avoiding conflict or couldn’t care less about the constitution.

Moroccans must rebel against the country’s “medieval laws”, the winner of France’s top literary prize has declared, following the arrest of two teenage girls who were caught kissing.

Leïla Slimani, who this week became the first Moroccan woman to win the prestigious Prix Goncourt for her novel Chanson Douce (Sweet Song), lambasted her homeland’s human rights record and the way women are treated.

A joint statement from about 20 human rights groups said the girls, aged 16 and 17, were badly beaten by their families after being filmed by a neighbour with a mobile phone kissing on the roof of a house in Marrakesh last week.

The statement said the pair, identified only by their first names, Sanaa and Hajar, were denied food for three days by the police who then forced one of them to sign a statement before releasing them on Thursday.

“The humiliation of citizens, the way they are kept down, encourages a political system based on disdain, humiliation and the abuse of power,” Slimani told France Inter radio.

“I think it is time people took this in hand and rebelled. The laws in Morocco are completely medieval, completely disconnected from reality … they ban sex outside marriage, homosexuality and adultery,” said the 35-year-old, whose award-winning novel is based on a real-life case of a nanny in the US accused of killing two children she was looking after.

The Moroccan Association of Human Rights has appointed a lawyer to defend the girls who, if convicted, could be imprisoned for between six months and three years. “We shouldn’t be hypocrites. Moroccans have sex lives outside marriage, and it’s good that there are homosexuals,” the author said.

Slimani, who raised eyebrows at home with her debut novel last year about a female nymphomaniac, said the oppression women suffered had nothing to do with religion.

“Lots of imams and enlightened theologians will explain that to you … It is a question of human rights, sexual rights, the right to dignity and in particular the dignity of women’s bodies.”

Slimani said a woman should not just be regarded as “a mother, nor a sister, nor a wife, but as a woman, an individual with their own rights”.

Torn between religious conservatism and opening up to the west, the overwhelmingly Muslim north African country has been the centre of a series controversies over moral issues in recent years.

Do you eat Nutella by the spoonful? Or just spread it on toast?

The answer to that question might seem like an intensely private matter, but it is one that is currently being studied by regulators at the US Food and Drug Administration, which is asking consumers how much of the famous Italian nut-cocoa concoction they eat, in an attempt to determine whether Nutella is a “spread” or a “topping”.

The answer could lead to a change in how Nutella is labeled in the US – which in turn could make it more attractive to calorie-conscious consumers.

Ferrero, the multibillion-euro behemoth Italian confectionery company behind Nutella, has launched an effort in Washington to change Nutella’s current designation, which was established in 1993.

Under current rules, Nutella is considered a “dessert topping”, along with fruits, syrups, spreads, marshmallow cream, nuts and dairy and non-dairy whipped toppings. Critically for Nutella, the designation, which the FDA said was based on a 1991 consumer survey that showed a “significant” number of respondents used Nutella as a dessert topping for ice cream, meant that the average serving size was considered to be two tablespoons.

The product’s US label lists that this estimated serving size contains 11 grams of fat, or 17% of the daily recommended value, and 200 calories.

If Ferrero gets its way, the FDA will soon change Nutella’s designation so that the “nut cocoa-based spread” is regulated in the same way as honey, jams, jellies, fruit butter and molasses. The average portion size for those is one tablespoon. The change would therefore reduce by 50% the amount of fat and calories listed on Nutella’s US nutritional label.

The UK, France and Australia, among others, use the one tablespoon as an average serving size.



Nutella, which is made with sugar, palm oil, hazelnuts and cocoa, has also provided the FDA with its own research suggesting that most people consumed about one tablespoon every time they ate Nutella, and that in about half of those occasions, it was eaten with bread. Ferrero cited a 2012 survey of 722 Nutella consumers that showed just 6% eat Nutella on its own.



According to public documents listed on www.regulations.gov, Ferrero has been lobbying for the change since 2014 with the help of its attorneys, Washington law firm Hogan Lovells. A May letter from the law firm to the FDA requesting a meeting on the issue was signed by Joseph Levitt, a Hogan Lovells partner who previously served as the director of FDA’s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition.

In Italy, Nutella is ubiquitous, used both as a spread on bread, but also as a filling in flakey cornetti, Italy’s version of croissants, in cookies, cakes and ice cream.

In its coverage of the news, La Repubblica said a final decision would be made in two months “and the pounds gained, accordingly”.

On Thursday Gina Miller won her case against the British government in the high court. The court agreed with her that the government acting alone cannot trigger article 50 – the mechanism by which the UK starts the process of leaving the EU.

Many people, including the national press, have characterised this ruling as a subversion of democracy and a violation of the will of the people. The truth is the opposite.

The government’s position is that it is legally able to trigger article 50 using the royal prerogative. The royal prerogative constitutes the powers the monarch used to have, and which are now enacted through the government of the day. It has long been an established part of the UK’s unwritten constitution that the royal prerogative cannot be used to make or alter the law made by parliament.

Miller’s position is that the royal prerogative cannot be used to trigger article 50 because, as the government agreed, the triggering of article 50 inevitably would result in fundamental rights enacted by parliament being swept aside once the withdrawal process is completed.

This removal of rights would happen regardless of whether or not the government has been successful in negotiating a withdrawal agreement, and without the say of parliament.

The most fundamental rule of the UK constitution is that parliament is the supreme law-making entity in the UK. It can make or undo any law. Neither the courts, nor the government acting alone, can overrule the legislation of parliament. That is what the government was seeking to do – and why this ruling is so important. The court has upheld the fundamental principle that laws parliament has enacted cannot be swept away by the government.

Parliament did vote on the European Union Referendum Act 2015, which was a short piece of legislation establishing only that a referendum would be held on whether the UK should remain a member of the EU. This was the question put to the British electorate, and on which the conclusion was reached that Britain should leave.

Neither the British people nor parliament have, however, voted on what form that leaving should take, or on which fundamental rights will be removed as a result of leaving. Those are questions that can be decided only by our sovereign parliament.

This ruling is a victory for democracy. It upholds the fundamental principle of our democracy: that laws enacted by parliament cannot be undone by a government acting through the royal prerogative. For the court to hold otherwise would have given the government free rein to sweep away any legislation it did not agree with and remove the power of parliament as the maker of our laws. This would have torn up the established principle of parliamentary sovereignty, which has been the most important part of our constitution since 1610. Gina Miller’s case is a victory for process over politics.

The three judges who ruled that the UK government would have to pass an act of parliament before it could trigger article 50 to leave the EU have come in for intense criticism domestically.

But in examples from around the world this week, the judiciary has been on the frontline in the defence of freedom. Far from being seen as the enemy of the people, judges are often viewed as their most trusted allies.

An independent judiciary can be a last bulwark against corruption, press censorship and an overweening executive, whereas a weakened judiciary subjected to political influence gives governments a free hand.

In Hong Kong, for instance, many people hope the judiciary will help their fight against Beijing’s growing encroachment on the city’s autonomy. A judge there will shortly rule on whether two young pro-democracy politicians who have refused to swear an oath of allegiance to Chinese rule can be recognised as legislators.

The judgment will determine the independence of the legislature, assuming the Chinese government does not in effect overrule the courts.

In South Africa, a country still learning to love its constitution, high court judges and the former public protector Thuli Madonsela have played a key role in exposing corruption allegations against the president, Jacob Zuma, and the ruling ANC party. This week Zuma dropped his opposition to the publication of a report by Madonsela that recommends a commission of inquiry headed by a judge be set up within 30 days to investigate alleged influence peddling in government.

Similarly, in Zimbabwe, independent judges have repeatedly challenged Robert Mugabe’s efforts to ban public demonstrations.

In Brazil a federal judge, Sérgio Moro, could topple the recently installed president, Michel Temer. Moro has become the public face of the battle to uncover corruption across Brazil. He ordered the arrest of four members of the senate’s own internal police force, who have been accused of obstructing an investigation into the Petrobras scandal.

In India, journalists and media organisations are asking judges to intervene after the government was accused of censorship reminiscent of the country’s 1970s emergency. A network was ordered off the air over its reporting of an attack by Pakistan-based militants.

In an example of the dangers of a non-independent judiciary, Venezuela’s supreme court, which is controlled by government sympathisers, this week allowed President Nicolás Maduro to remove budgetary authority from the congress, the country’s main source of political opposition.

And in Turkey, where opposition MPs were arrested early on Friday, the chances of judges intervening are slim. A law passed this year has gutted the bulk of the judiciary. A total of 3,700 judges have been arrested or prosecuted. MPs have lost their immunity from prosecution and press censorship has been imposed.



Meanwhile, the rightwing attack on the British judiciary comes at a time when the role of Britain as an international legal beacon is under pressure. Theresa May in her brief leadership campaign may have shelved plans to remove Britain from the European convention on human rights and introduce a British bill. But the persistence of the attack on the ECHR by ministers has had an impact.



Equally, the government has removed a reference in the ministerial code to the requirement that ministers comply with international law. The government said it was merely an innocent tidying-up process, but it comes at a time when the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, frequently makes reference to plans to bring Russian or Syrian perpetrators of war crimes to justice in international courts.

Moreover, the current attorney general, Jeremy Wright, like his predecessor, Dominic Grieve, underlines “the intense public scrutiny that the UK’s government actions attract on the world stage and the importance of international law to both frame and defend those actions.”

With African nations from South Africa to Gambia rushing to leave the international criminal court, it is arguably even more important that British ministers, starting with the lord chancellor, Liz Truss, speak out to defend the rule of law, as is their statutory duty, rather than through silence connive in judicial intimidation.

For all its faults, the UK judiciary is seen as fair and predictable. It is the international gold standard, and one of the key sources of the UK’s soft power.

The refusal of the lord chancellor, Liz Truss, to defend three senior judges from “the vitriol” of sustained media attacks following the Brexit judgment has been condemned by Lord Falconer, who previously held the post.

The former Labour cabinet minister asked why Truss, who is also justice secretary, remained silent in the face of personal denunciations in the rightwing, pro-Brexit papers. 



The Daily Mail described the judges – the lord chief justice, Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd, the master of the rolls, Sir Terence Etherton, and Lord Justice Sales – as “enemies of the people”. 



The Daily Telegraph carried front-page pictures of them with the headline: “The judges versus the people.” Their judgment on Thursday declared that only parliament has the legal power to trigger article 50, which would initiate Brexit.

Writing in the Guardian, Lord Falconer, who was lord chancellor between 2003 and 2007, said: “The British public continues to have confidence in the independence and quality of judges. But both are undermined by this Brexit-inspired media vitriol.

“The lord chancellor, Liz Truss, has a constitutional duty to defend the judges. She needs to make it clear immediately the government has no quarrel with the judges and has total confidence in them. 



“Disagreement with the judges is dealt with by appeal not by abuse. Liz Truss’s silence feeds the sense the government is either hopeless at avoiding conflict or couldn’t care less about the constitution.”

Labour’s justice spokesman, Richard Burgon MP, also urged Truss, to uphold the independence of the judiciary in the face of “hysterical headlines … Some of the headlines in today’s newspapers personally attacking the judges who heard this case are unacceptable,” he said.

“As lord chancellor, Liz Truss should not stay silent. It is the lord chancellor’s job to uphold the independence of British judges and she must speak out urgently against the hysterical headlines of some papers and these attacks on British justice.”

The Liberal Democrat leader, Tim Farron, said: “Where is Liz Truss? Her job is to uphold the rule of law and defend the judiciary and yet she is utterly silent while judges are being attacked by some newspapers. Our hard-fought rights and freedoms are protected by the law, British law that the Brexiteers claim that they wish to uphold.”

Truss is under a statutory obligation to defend the independence of the judiciary, the solicitor and legal blogger David Allen Green has pointed out. Section 3(6) of the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 sets out the lord chancellor’s duty to protect judicial independence.

Asked whether Truss wished to comment, the Ministry of Justice said she would not be making a statement. 



The prime minister’s spokesman refused to condemn the language, saying: “I don’t think the British judiciary is being undermined.” He added: “I’m not commenting on newspaper coverage.”

Brendan Cox, widower of the Labour MP Jo Cox, cautioned against allowing the tone of the debate about Thursday’s judgment to become too febrile.

He tweeted: “Whatever our views on the court ruling I hope we can take a step back & debate it soberly. Inciting hatred has consequences.” Jo Cox, who represented the Batley and Spen constituency, was killed in the run-up to the EU referendum.

During the high court Brexit case the claimants challenging the ministers’ right to trigger Brexit received death threats and online abuse. 



The term “enemies of the people”, coined in Roman times, was adopted by Robespierre during the French Revolution and was later favoured by Lenin and the Bolsheviks.



Politicians from the three main parties leapt to the defence of the judges. A former attorney general, Dominic Grieve, expressed alarm at attacks on the judiciary. “They are entirely unjustified and are either made in ignorance or out of malice, it’s impossible to know which,” he said.

“The judges are the safeguarders of our unwritten constitution. Nothing they have done ought to take anybody by surprise. To accede to the principle that you can change primary legislation by royal prerogative is a constitutional monstrosity and would totally undermine everything that our forebears struggled to give us. It would trash the constitution.”

The Conservative chair of the Commons justice select committee, Bob Neill, and Anna Soubry MP, a barrister, also condemned the headlines. She described the coverage in a tweet as: “Hysterical, dangerously inaccurate & bullying”.

Jonathan Marks, the Liberal Democrat justice spokesman, said: “The headlines in much of the press today and the anti-judge rhetoric from some politicians is extremely worrying. This hostility to the rule of law is irresponsible; the personal attacks on judges are plain nasty.

“British citizens won our freedoms from the tyranny of the crown painfully and over many centuries. The rights of minorities to think as they will, to live at peace and to claim the protection of the law against an over-mighty state are at stake here.”

Lord Macdonald of River Glaven QC, a former director of public prosecutions, said: “These are risible and constitutionally illiterate attacks from politicians who should know better. The high court has reaffirmed the sovereignty of parliament within the rule of law. In other words, it has fulfilled precisely its most critical function in a democratic society. The idea that judges would be better employed kowtowing to the executive is shameful heresy from political pygmies.”

Chantal-Aimée Doerries QC, the chair of the Bar Council, which represents barristers across England and Wales, said: “Publicly criticising individual members of the judiciary over a particular judgment or suggesting that they are motivated by their individual views, political or otherwise, is wrong, and serves only to undermine their vital role in the administration of justice.”

The Welsh Assembly announced on Friday that it would seek permission to intervene in the anticipated supreme court hearing in which the government will appeal against the high court ruling. Announcing the Welsh government’s involvement, Mick Antoniw, an assembly member and counsel general for Wales, said he would raise concerns about the impact of Theresa May’s attempt to use royal prerogative powers on the devolved assembly.

When the justice secretary, Liz Truss, launched her white paper on prison reform on 3 November, she referred to another Elizabeth: prison reformer Elizabeth Fry. In the 1800s, Fry campaigned passionately for a more human system and her spirit continues today, in more than 1,500 charities that are equally passionate. If she wants to reform the system, Truss has to place the voluntary sector front and centre.

The sector’s achievements include creating the probation service, introducing prison visiting, independent inspection of prisons, and ending the death penalty. It started the first service to support people’s re-entry into society in 1921. From the chaos of the Strangeways riots in the early 1990s we saw the emergence of proper family services. The pioneering work of the Young Review and organisations like the Trust, founded following the death of Zahid Mubarak, have tackled racism in our system head-on.

But reform can’t be the exclusive domain of the voluntary sector – we need to work with government. These prison reforms provide an opportunity for change that we need to grab with both hands.

It’s positive to hear there will be 2,500 more prison staff. Prisons are unsafe for staff and prisoners alike. Too much of the time, cells are locked and people can’t get the support they so desperately need.

But before we get these new staff on the wings, the real challenge is understanding what a prison officer should – and shouldn’t – do. This is the time to consider how those staff could work as part of a multi-disciplinary team to turn around lives and address the complex needs experienced by the majority of people in prison.

Empowering prison governors, allowing them to shape their services locally and adapt their regime to the needs of the people in their care, makes sense. But they shouldn’t have to do that alone. They should work with the expertise in the voluntary sector, making prisons think beyond their walls and reaching out into communities.

There’s an opportunity to bring back the strategic coordination of voluntary agencies in every prison, really capitalising on the goodwill and enthusiasm of the sector. There is a lot more in the reforms of huge interest for charities, including the commitment to better education, cracking down on drugs, and the welcome announcement that there will be new smaller custodial units for women. There are also things that still need attention, such as how we stem the tide of people going into prison in the first place. This requires us to look seriously at sentencing as well as how we divert people away by using well-evidenced alternatives to custody.

There needs to be a whole system view – diversion, sentencing, prison experience, but crucially how prisons and probation link with the ecosystem of support in our communities to rehabilitate and resettle people effectively. The most recent public service reform in probation showed us that the voluntary sector can easily be left behind or be taken for granted.

These reforms need to learn from past mistakes and move forward alongside the voluntary sector, utilising its vast experience and expertise. Anything less would be a mistake.

Finally, we can’t forget the most important voices in this debate, those with lived experience of the prison system. The prisoners, their families, men and women from different ethnicities and backgrounds that have passed through prisons. They hold the answers. So far, we haven’t heard their voice in this debate, but we need to.

On Thursday morning, the high court ruled that parliament – and not the prime minister by use of prerogative powers – would need to trigger Article 50 to start the UK’s exit from the European Union.

On Thursday evening, a portion of the British media exercised its own prerogative: to attack the judges behind the ruling.

Some lawyers and legal experts thought “enemies of the people” was perhaps a little over the top:

Others homed in on the finer detail:

How about that fencing, though?

The Telegraph also pits the judges against “the people” and turns them blue, to hammer home an unspecified point:

There are, though, reasons beyond the fact that they’re silly to object to headlines like these:

Mind you, Kelemen is professor of political science and Jean Monnet chair in European Union politics at Rutgers University, New Jersey, and sounds suspiciously like one of those “experts”. As does this Bagehot chap:

Telegraph columnist (but pro-Remainer) Mary Riddell appears to be giving Friday’s edition a miss:

Meanwhile, over in Daily Express-land:

Spare your pinch-zoom fingers; here’s that first paragraph:

It’s not just as bad as the second world war, though, as the Express goes on:

By contrast, the Sun’s take is fairly tame, plumping for the cosy familiarity of foreigners, elites and a blink-and-that’ll-be-funnier-than-actually-seeing-it pun. It’s almost as if they don’t genuinely believe that Brexit has been blocked after all.

The number of workers taking claims of unfair dismissal or discrimination to employment tribunals has slumped since charges came into force, a study has revealed.

Unfair dismissal claims have fallen by 73% and there have been huge reductions in discrimination cases on grounds of sex (71%), race (58%) and disability (54%), since charges of up to £1,200 were introduced, the Trades Union Congress said.

The number of workers taking claims to a tribunal averaged 16,000 a month in 2012-13, but that figure fell to 7,000 in the past year, the TUC said.

The TUC general secretary, Frances O’Grady, said: “These figures show a huge drop in workers seeking justice when they’ve been unfairly treated. Now bosses know they can get away with it, discrimination at work can flourish unchecked and people can be sacked without good reason.

“The evidence is there for all to see. These fees – of up to £1,200, even if you’re on the minimum wage – are pricing out thousands each month from pursuing cases.

“Theresa May has repeatedly said she wants to govern for ordinary working people. Here is a perfect opportunity. She could reverse employment tribunal fees, and make sure workers can challenge bad employers in court.”

The government is being urged to abolish the fees in this month’s autumn statement.

Theresa May is heading for a rebellion over her Brexit strategy after the high court ruled that the UK could not leave the European union without the permission of the British parliament.

Three senior judges ruled on Thursday that the government could not press ahead with triggering article 50 of the Lisbon treaty, the formal process for beginning Brexit, without first consulting MPs and peers in the Commons and Lords.

The decision, made after a legal challenge brought following the EU referendum result in June, is a dramatic setback for the prime minister, who had argued that she had the personal authority to begin the process without a parliamentary vote on the issue.

Downing Street has said they will challenge the judgment and an appeal with the supreme court is expected to be lodged. But David Davis, the Brexit secretary, acknowledged that the ruling (pdf) as it stood meant the UK’s departure from the bloc would require the consent of both MPs and peers through an act of parliament. “The judges have laid out what we can’t do, and not exactly what we can do, but we’re presuming that it requires an act of parliament and therefore both Commons and Lords,” he said.

Parliamentarians are unlikely to block Brexit outright, given that 52% of voters among the public opted, on 23 June, to leave the EU, but the need for legislation gives MPs the opportunity to disrupt the process by demanding May reveals more details about her plan for negotiating the terms of departure.

The Guardian understands that a cross-party group of Tory and Labour MPs met this Thursday afternoon to discuss how the ruling could be used to force May to reveal more about her broad negotiating aims.

Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, said he now believed it was “inevitable the prime minister will have to answer the big questions” on whether she wanted the UK to be in the single market or the customs union, as there appeared to be a majority of MPs demanding greater transparency.

“This is about accountability and scrutiny,” he said. “Very many MPs accept and respect the referendum of course, but the terms upon which we exit are vitally important. I think there is now consensus that the prime minister has got to disclose the overarching strategy. The idea that we are all to be kept in the dark until some time in 2019 only has to be said to be rejected.”

May has repeatedly insisted that she will deliver the “best possible deal for the country” but has so far refused to specify whether that deal would include access to the single market or enhanced immigration controls.

Within hours of the judgment senior Conservatives were openly calling for a change of approach. Andrew Tyrie, chair of the Treasury committee, said May’s government needed to be “much more transparent about its objectives in the negotiations, in some detail, and the sooner the better”.

He added: “It should also ensure that parliament can scrutinise the objectives and vote on them. The UK is leaving; a public debate is needed about where we want to arrive. Before taking off, it is always a good idea for the pilot to discuss with the passengers and crew where they might want to land.”

Nicky Morgan, the former education secretary, told BBC Two’s Victoria Derbyshire show: “It does need to be not just a vote, but a formal short bill about the triggering of article 50, and then the focus is on that. The other thing, of course, that parliament will want then is a clearer plan on the government’s Brexit plans and that will be, I think, important in helping the government to win that vote.”

On the other side of the debate the ruling infuriated many eurosceptics, with several Tory MPs suggesting May should call an early general election to get another mandate from voters.

Dominic Raab, the former minister and Tory MP, said any attempt to stall the triggering of Brexit could increase the chances of an early general election. “If we get to the stage where effectively [some MPs] are not willing to allow this negotiation to even begin, I think there must be an increased chance that we must go to the country again. I think that would be a mistake and I don’t think those trying to break the verdict of the referendum would be rewarded,” he said.

Douglas Carswell, the Ukip MP, even suggested it showed there needed to be reform of judicial appointments, while the party’s interim leader, Nigel Farage, said he feared a “betrayal may be near at hand”. He said: “I now fear that every attempt will be made to block or delay the triggering of article 50. If this is so, they have no idea of the level of public anger they will provoke.”

The prime minister is expected on Friday to speak to Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, to discuss her plans for keeping the article 50 process on track.

However, the unanimous judgment delivered by three of the most senior judges in England and Wales will make it difficult for government lawyers to overturn the ruling in the supreme court and avoid delay.

The three judges, the lord chief justice, Lord Thomas, the master of the rolls, Sir Terence Etherton, and lord justice Sales at one stage dismissed the government’s argument as being “divorced from reality”.

Government lawyers had argued that prerogative powers were a legitimate way to give effect “to the will of the people” who voted by a majority to leave the EU in the referendum. But the lord chief justice declared: “The government does not have power under the crown’s prerogative to give notice pursuant to article 50 for the UK to withdraw from the European union.”

The judgment ruled: “The most fundamental rule of the UK constitution is that parliament is sovereign and can make and unmake any law it chooses ... By making and unmaking treaties the crown [ie the government] creates legal effects on the plane of international law, but in doing so it does not and cannot change domestic law. It cannot without the intervention of parliament confer rights on individuals or deprive individuals of rights.”

The pound surged to a four-week high in the hours after the ruling as investors interpreted it as a sign parliament could put the brakes on any attempt by May to pursue a so-called “hard Brexit” that prioritised controlling immigration over trade with the EU.

Although a related legal challenge failed in Northern Ireland’s high court, the claimants are expected to appeal against that decision, particularly on Brexit’s impact on the devolved legislation. Their claim will be joined at the supreme court hearing with the London case.

Nicola Sturgeon, the SNP first minister of Scotland, said the Scottish government would “actively consider” whether it would formally join in the next legal battle over the right of MPs to vote on article 50, opposing the Westminster government.

The two main claimants in the high court case in London insisted they were not attempting to prevent Brexit. Gina Miller, an investment manager and lead claimant in the case, said: “It was the right decision because we were dealing with the sovereignty of parliament. It was not about winning or losing. It was about what was right. Now we can move forward with legal certainty.”

Deir Dos Santos, a hairdresser and the other lead claimant, said: “Today’s judgment is a victory for everyone who believes in the supremacy of our parliament and the rule of law. I have never challenged the result of the referendum – in fact I voted for Brexit for the sole reason that I wanted power to be returned from Europe to the British parliament. But I did not think it was right for the government then just to bypass parliament and try to take away my legal rights without consulting parliament first.”

Uber is facing the likelihood of several hundred more legal claims from taxi drivers who believe they have been wrongly classed as self-employed and are owed backdated holiday pay and missing wages.



Lawyers for two former drivers who last week won an employment tribunal judgment that they were in fact employed as workers and should therefore benefit from the minimum wage, holiday pay and sick pay, said they were preparing to lodge multiple new cases with the same court.

The US taxi app giant has pledged to appeal against last Friday’s verdict, which was sharply critical of Uber’s treatment of its drivers as self-employed. Nineteen drivers lodged claims and two, Yasseen Aslam and James Farrar, were selected to test the issues in front of the tribunal. Uber is expected to issue proceedings at the court of appeal this month or next.

If successful the new cases could significantly increase Uber’s costs in holiday pay and compensation for underpayment of the minimum wage where it can be proved.

“We have received hundreds of inquiries from Uber drivers who are unhappy with their working conditions and are interested in bringing a claim for back pay of holiday pay and back pay of the national minimum wage,” said Annie Powell, employment lawyer at Leigh Day solicitors.

“We will lodge further employment tribunal claims with the support of the GMB union. It will be exactly the same claim as for the first 19 drivers and we will argue they should be workers rather than self-employed and so should be entitled to workers’ rights.”

Powell said there was no limit to the number of cases it could run. The firm had pursued class actions with over a thousand claimants in other matters. Uber has 40,000 drivers in the UK, but the company insists that according to its own survey, three-quarters of its drivers feel that “being self-employed and being able to choose their own hours is preferable to having things like holiday pay which come with being employed”. Uber argues it does not employ the drivers and that while it charges commission on each fare, the contract is between the driver and passenger.

However, in last Friday’s ruling the tribunal judges dismissed as “faintly ridiculous” Uber’s claim that its London operation was essentially made up of thousands of small businesses linked by a technology platform. Uber resorted to “fictions, twisted language and even brand new terminology” to portray their drivers as self-employed, they said, and ruled that it was “unreal to deny that Uber is in business as a supplier of transportation services”.

“Simple common sense argues to the contrary,” the tribunal ruled.

Uber is resisting the ruling and has told its drivers: “There will be no change to your partnership with Uber in light of this decision and we will continue to support the overwhelming majority of drivers who tell us that they use the Uber app to be their own boss and choose when and where to drive.”

Jo Bertram, Uber’s regional general manager in the UK said in a statement: “Tens of thousands of people in London drive with Uber precisely because they want to be self-employed and their own boss. The overwhelming majority of drivers who use the Uber app want to keep the freedom and flexibility of being able to drive when and where they want.”

Steve Garelick, secretary of the professional drivers branch of the GMB union, said the new claims were evidence that “drivers have finally realised they have a voice”. He said the GMB has received hundreds of calls from Uber drivers seeking advice or support in making a claim.

“I spoke to a driver this week who was so emotional over the fact that finally someone is listening to their plight,” he said. “People have not been able to articulate it before on a larger platform like the tribunal.”

Uber declined to comment on the potential new employment tribunal claims.

Pressure is mounting for a public inquiry into the adoption of hundreds of thousands of babies born to unmarried women over a 30-year period amid claims from some mothers who say they were coerced into handing over their children.

A letter will be sent to the home secretary, Amber Rudd, next week from solicitors at two eminent law firms calling on her to convene a public inquiry into historical adoption practices in the UK. The solicitors say an inquiry would uncover the truth about the practices – stretching over three decades after the end of the second world war – and hold agencies to account.

Meanwhile more women have come forward to tell their stories of being pressured into having their babies adopted.



The call for an inquiry will be sent to Rudd on Thursday, the day after the broadcast of a television documentary relating the stories of several women. That film has prompted an apology from Cardinal Vincent Nichols, head of the Catholic church in England and Wales, and a statement expressing regret from the Church of England. Religious institutions and agencies handled most adoptions until 1976, after which the process became the responsibility of local authorities.

Carolynn Gallwey, of Bhatt Murphy Solicitors, and Karon Monaghan, of Matrix Chambers, are demanding an inquiry to acknowledge the trauma suffered by young vulnerable mothers and the impact on their lives. On a practical level, they say an inquiry could lead to records being made available and professional counselling offered.



“It is the only way to get a proper understanding of what happened and identify any systemic issues which amounted to coercion, whether there were policies – formal or informal – which discouraged young women from keeping their babies,” said Gallwey.



About half a million babies, most born to unmarried women, were adopted in the 1950s, 60s and 70s when the Catholic church, Church of England and the Salvation Army ran “mother and baby homes” and adoption agencies in the UK. Adoption reached a peak in 1968, when more than 16,000 babies born to unmarried mothers were handed over to new families.



In recent years, some women have publicly said they feel they were effectively forced to hand over their babies. Now mostly in their 60s and 70s, they say that as vulnerable young women they were made to feel shame and guilt, and were told that adoption was in the best interests of themselves and their babies.



“There is a very compelling set of facts from a recent period of our history which is still having an impact now,” said Gallwey. An inquiry, she added, could “correct the myth that these women gave away their babies voluntarily”.

She added: “All the women I’ve spoken to say that [the women acted voluntarily] could not be further from the truth. The saddest thing is the number of women who say, ‘no one told me there was another way’. It’s still very raw even after so long.”



The call for a public inquiry was backed by Graham Allen, Labour MP for Nottingham North, who sponsored a parliamentary motion last year calling on the government to apologise for “unacceptable adoption and care practices of the past”.



He said an inquiry “would draw a line for everyone”, adding: “No monetary amount could compensate for what these people have been through, but it could be cathartic and cleansing.”



Veronica Smith, co-founder of the Movement for an Adoption Apology, also backed the call. “We’ve been trying to get something done for years. We want acknowledgement of bad practice – the coercion of often teenage girls into losing their children,” she said.



Now 75, Smith gave birth to a daughter in 1964 who was, she says, taken from her for adoption. “It has coloured the whole of my life,” she said.



She would be willing to testify to an inquiry. “But there are lots of women who can’t even verbalise what happened to them. They are screwed up with pain and shame and guilt. There are thousands who have never come forward, but every time there is publicity on this people make contact wanting to tell their story, often for the first time.”



Among the mothers and adopted children who responded to a Guardian appeal on Thursday was “Linda”, who became pregnant aged 15 in the early 1970s. “It was the ultimate sin. I was so scared that I didn’t tell my parents until it was too late to ‘do’ anything about it, by which time I was about seven months. I had been wearing girdles and starving myself so it wouldn’t show,” she said.



Linda’s parents arranged through a Catholic adoption agency for her to go to a mother and baby home. She said: “A nun came and told me she was just taking my baby [aged about three weeks] to weigh him. That was the last time I saw him. I was absolutely devastated. Within the family we agreed not to ever talk about it and to pretend it never happened ... Every baby I saw on the streets made me want to steal it. I was seriously angry all the time but couldn’t talk about it.”



She added: “It’s my dirty little secret and I admit it has probably poisoned me a bit over the years. I think of it as the punishment that keeps on giving for doing what I did.”



Another woman, “Sandra”, lost her baby to adoption when she was 15, in the early 1970s. She said: “Physical and emotional consequences led me to be sterilised at age 25. I was far too traumatised to face another pregnancy and did not receive adequate health care after the birth, leading to a great deal of pain. I still suffer from PTSD. I grieve for my lost child every day and will do so until I die.”



“Janet” said that her husband had been adopted in 1963 through a Church of England agency. “He was subject to the most awful neglect and abuse mainly at [the adoptive mother’s] hands. There is a lot of emphasis put on the way the [birth] mothers were treated but little said about the fate of those babies that the church felt justified in giving to so-called Christian families,” she said.



Duncan Roy said he had been born in a Catholic mother and baby home in Kent when his mother was 16. “To do penance for the sin of getting pregnant out of wedlock she had to scrub floors every day she was there until I was born. She was verbally and physically abused by the nuns in the home,” the 56-year-old said. “When I was born I was taken away from her, but because I was half-Iranian and a dark baby they couldn’t find anyone to adopt me. Eventually my grandmother decided to take me back and raise me as hers. The whole experience had a huge effect on my mother’s life. She was very badly traumatised by her experiences at the home.”

An oil executive accused of impersonating Elon Musk in an email in an attempt to solicit company secrets from Tesla wants the lawsuit thrown out because he says his impersonation wasn’t credible.



Todd Katz was the former chief financial officer of Quest Integrity, which provides services to oil and gas companies such as ExxonMobil, BP, Chevron and Shell.

In September, Tesla filed a lawsuit against Katz, claiming he set up the email address elontesla@yahoo.com to impersonate the company’s CEO and then used it to try and extract sensitive information from Tesla chief financial officer Jason Wheeler.

According to the lawsuit, Katz sent an email from the elontesla@yahoo.com account to Wheeler on 3 August 2016 requesting more detailed information about Tesla’s second-quarter financial results that were released on the same day.

Wheeler did not respond and instead Tesla launched an investigation to find out who was behind the email, eventually tracing the address to Katz and his employer.

This week, Katz filed an objection to Tesla’s lawsuit arguing that the company’s reaction has been “over-the-top” and alleging that Tesla hacked into his Twitter in order to identify him.

The filing does not quibble that Katz sent the email but argues that “nobody who received this preposterous and grammatically deficient email ever believed it really came from Elon Musk” and as a result there was no credible impersonation and no direct injury to Tesla.

“It is clear that the email allegedly received by CFO Wheeler on August 3, 2016 was goofy, grammatically deficient communication that was not a ‘credible’ impersonation of Elon Musk in any way,” says the document, filed in the Santa Clara superior court.

Some of the reasons given for the lack of credibility include the use of a Yahoo email account and the “peculiar syntax of the email” that bears no similarity to that of Elon Musk “who is known to be a stickler for grammar and who would never use such atrocious syntax”.

It goes onto suggest that Tesla’s lawsuit is a “heavy-handed attempt to intimidate and silence Mr Katz, a Tesla critic.”

At the same time, Katz has filed a cross-complaint against Tesla for allegedly hacking into a Twitter account – @valuationmattrs – that he uses to criticize Tesla’s business practices. The complaint alleges that as part of Tesla’s investigation the company accessed the account illegally, causing Katz to suffer damages “including loss of earnings and damage to reputation”.

In a statement, a Tesla spokeswoman said: “The oil executive Todd Katz is perfectly capable of embarrassing himself with no help from Tesla. We did not even know that the Twitter pseudonym in question belonged to Mr Katz.

“What we are most interested in discovering is what people or organizations collaborated with Mr Katz in his attempt to gain information illegally from Tesla and who or what companies may have paid him to do so. That is of great concern to us and many members of the public.”

If you’re an ardent remainer hoping the high court judgment is a chink of light that could ultimately result in Britain remaining in the European Union, don’t hold your breath. Brexit itself was not on trial – but Theresa May’s bullish approach to it, and ultimately her political judgment, was.

If the government fails in its bid to have the ruling overturned on appeal, the Brexit secretary, David Davis, has made clear he would put a bill before both houses of parliament, presumably authorising the government to trigger article 50.

But while there are plenty of MPs on both sides of the House of Commons who backed remain during the referendum campaign, and still believe Britain would be better off in, only a handful of diehards now say they want to block Brexit.

One prominent pro-EU MP on the Conservative back benches told the Guardian “almost every one of my colleagues, apart perhaps from Ken Clarke, will vote to trigger article 50”.

In the House of Lords, meanwhile, where there is a strong remain majority, Labour’s leader Baroness Smith says there is little appetite for trying to prevent it. “It’s not a case of the Lords trying to block the government,” she insists.

Instead, parliamentarians in both Houses will seize on the opportunity to force the government to lay out in more detail the principles the government will adopt in the negotiations – and they feel emboldened to do so because of the way the issue has been handled since June.

During the months between taking office and the Conservative party conference, May moved from “Brexit means Brexit” to promising to deliver the best possible deal for the economy, consistent with taking back control of immigration and escaping the jurisdiction of the European court of justice.

But she also hardened up her position on the role parliament should play, or rather not play – insisting she would take the ultimate decision about triggering the two-year divorce process without giving MPs a vote.

It is perhaps too early in May’s premiership to judge how her government will operate, but some in Westminster suggest Thursday’s court judgment – and certainly MPs’ reaction to it – ultimately came about because of a characteristic decision-making style.

Perhaps a lack of boldness – or more charitably, swagger – prevented her from locking in parliament’s approval in her early days in Downing Street, by offering MPs a vote validating the result of the referendum, something it would have been very hard for them to refuse.

David Cameron had said throughout the referendum campaign that he would trigger article 50 immediately if the public voted to leave. May chose to delay, perhaps on the advice of Whitehall civil servants understandably anxious about the scale of the challenge of the negotiations.

But by stringing out the process, while appearing to give MPs and the public as little information as possible about the government’s stance, she has riled many in her own party.

Meanwhile, by carrying out such a sweeping reshuffle when she arrived in No 10, she has peopled the back benches with articulate advocates of a different, more collegiate approach – such as those sacked in the reshuffle, including Nicky Morgan, Anna Soubry and George Osborne, who have all begun to flex their muscles.

There have been other early indicators of a less-than-sure political touch, too: May blundered into a row with the Bank of England’s governor, Mark Carney, by breaking the convention that politicians don’t comment on monetary policy, expressing concerns in her conference speech she had concerns about quantitative easing.

She struck a pose as the champion of the people against big business but watered down Cameron’s planned obesity strategy so radically that even supermarkets said they would have liked tougher regulation.

On Heathrow, she partially suspended cabinet collective responsibility and shelved the idea of an immediate vote for fear of the scale of opposition in her own party. She still lost an MP over it and then chose not to stand a candidate against him. It hardly looks like deft political management.

And over a series of other questions: from Hinkley Point C to Amber Rudd’s language on immigration; to the Orgreave non-inquiry; to the secret Nissan deal; somehow the political dots haven’t quite joined up.

Whitehall insiders say, despite May’s loathing of Cameron’s “chumocracy”, that key decisions are made by a tight clique of close allies and are not always subjected to the test of open, robust debate.

If the supreme court upholds Thursday’s ruling, No 10 has conceded that the “logical conclusion” will be to place a bill on triggering article 50 before both houses of parliament. But to have been dragged into doing so is not a great look. One pro-remain MP muttered darkly yesterday: “At best, she’s been very badly advised.”
###########################################################
The high court’s ruling that the government needs parliament’s approval before invoking article 50 has provoked roars of predictable outrage from the Brexit camp. Cries of “betrayal” and “a war on democracy” swamp Twitter, in a way that suggests that those who campaigned in the name of sovereignty are remarkably reluctant to accept what that sovereignty means. Now the high court has issued a short and forceful corrective that, for the sake of clarity, can be summarised like this: because parliament is sovereign, unrestrained executive power can only be used in matters where parliament has no say. Parliamentary sovereignty means that primary legislation, like the act that subordinated some UK law to Europe’s in 1972, cannot be overturned just on the government’s say so. Therefore the government cannot invoke article 50 without parliament’s authority.

Brexiters’ cries of foul ignore the facts. Both sides accepted that the case was within the court’s jurisdiction. They agreed too that it was a matter only of how, not if, article 50 should be invoked. This was no backdoor attempt to reverse the outcome of the referendum. There was no conspiracy. Rather, three of the most senior judges in England and Wales heard arguments on both sides from some of the best legal minds in the country and unanimously agreed that the law demanded parliament had a say.

The decision was expressed with such force and clarity that it is hard to imagine a successful appeal. For that reason alone, the government is wrong to insist it is going to try anyway, a decision that will make it even harder to meet the prime minister’s pledge to trigger article 50 by the end of March. That means a four-day hearing of the full court, currently eleven permanent justices. Scotland, Wales and possibly Northern Ireland are all likely to want to be involved, exacerbating division. And each session will be live-streamed in full view of global markets eager to trade on uncertainty.

Instead of continuing an expensive and time-consuming fight in an attempt to seek legitimacy for riding roughshod over parliament, the government would be much wiser to do what it should have done from the start and ask for parliament’s approval to start negotiations on the basis of a clear explanation of what it hopes to achieve. However, the overwhelming political question remains how to manage the consequences of the referendum in a way that heals rather than deepens differences, and in the context of the narrative of betrayal so eagerly fostered by some of her MPs and activists, the prime minister may believe it is better to be seen to fight all the way even if she ends up with the same result. Yet at some point soon, she must stand up to the insatiable zealots in the debate and confront them with her vision for Britain’s future relationship with the EU, and she must do it in parliament.

Meanwhile the government’s business managers will be aghast. They know they will be unlikely to get away with a simple vote of both houses. It might appear the least-cost option, but while the high court’s judgement is carefully non-prescriptive, it indicates that new legislation is necessary. If the government thinks differently, it risks another legal challenge. Yet getting a bill of this consequence through parliament, however short and apparently non-committal it is, conjures up a long vista of revolt and negotiation that is likely to extinguish hopes of any other legislative initiative for the rest of the session.

But now, those MPs – a majority – who supported remain are handed the challenge of holding the government to account without feeding into the Brexiters’ conspiracy theories. In particular, it is time for Labour, not least because it is the official opposition, to get on and agree a clear position. Some pro-remain MPs like Nick Clegg who has made much of the running in this debate would like a cross-party alliance around a demand for a second referendum to approve the final deal, and a commitment to staying in the single market. That may be hard for Jeremy Corbyn to accept. But, not least because an early election is back on the cards, he must as a matter of urgency set out what he does want, and how Labour will judge the government’s approach. It is time for a strategy rather than a series of important but piecemeal demands. Parliament is back where it should be, at the heart of the debate. Now Labour must be in the thick of the contest, bold and principled in support of the national interest.

The justice secretary denies there is a prisons crisis, but what else should one call it? Assaults, self-harm and suicide have risen alarmingly over the last year: Nick Hardwick, the chair of the parole board and former chief inspector of prisons thinks that violence behind bars is at its worst ever level. None of this is surprising given the sharp decline in staff numbers and loss of expertise since 2010, leaving 18,000 officers overseeing 86,000 inmates and dealing with new challenges presented by the influx of “legal highs”, mobile phones and use of drones to smuggle in other contraband. The good news is that Liz Truss has carried through some of the more practical of her predecessor Michael Gove’s bold promises on reform in today’s white paper on prisons. Stressing that the system’s purpose is safety and rehabilitation, not just containment, the justice secretary promised to recruit 2,500 more officers and build 10,000 modern prison places – including five small women’s “community prisons” – so decrepit Victorian jails can close. Such change is welcome; and it is needed urgently.

Prisons have been used as dumping grounds, the last resort for dealing with social policy failures, as their population shows: around a quarter have been in care as a child, at least a third have a mental or physical disability, and half have the literacy levels of an 11-year-old. It is hard enough to tackle complex and deep-rooted problems at the best of times; it is impossible to do so under current conditions. It is pointless to talk about rehabilitation when there are too few prison staff to let inmates out of their cells for longer than an hour or two or ensure even the most basic levels of hygiene, let alone engage constructively with them as the new strategy demands. Even with today’s boost, there will be 4,500 fewer officers than in 2010. And no one has yet built their way out of a prison crisis. Yet while ministers’ rhetoric has changed, in reality they are still on the course set by Michael “prison works” Howard and David Blunkett: the sentence inflation that they oversaw – for theft and drug offences, as well as violent and sexual crimes – has doubled the prison population since the early nineties. Real reform demands the courage to address sentencing, as former home and justice secretary Ken Clarke pointed out, and redirect resources to credible community alternatives, found to have significantly lower reoffending rates than short sentences in the government’s own research.

Recidivism costs the country £15bn a year, Ms Truss warned; almost half of prisoners are reconvicted within a year of release. She maintains that the solution is to cut reoffending, as well as increase early intervention to prevent people from committing crimes. In truth, to be viable, such a reduction needs enough officers with the opportunity to build relationships with a smaller prison population in a better estate.

The alternative, as Mr Clarke pointed out, is simply condemning more people to “overcrowded slums”. Nowhere is more deserving of this name than Pentonville, where an inmate was stabbed to death last month. Back in 1938 it was described as long overdue for demolition, yet here it is still, almost 80 years later, now condemned as “the grimmest of the grim”. Mr Gove was right to single it out when he first proposed his “new for old” building scheme; Ms Truss must make sure it is one of the first to go.

The three judges who delivered the pivotal Brexit judgment included the most senior in England and Wales.



The lord chief justice, Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd, is head of the judiciary. He is a forthright defender of judicial independence and a supporter of modernisation in the courts where cases are still conducted from behind mounds of files and paperwork.

Born in Wales – he remains a supporter of courts outside London – Lord Thomas was educated at Rugby school and Trinity Hall, Cambridge, where he read law. He started off practising in commercial cases, became a QC and an assistant recorder (part-time judge) in 1984.

In 1996, Thomas was appointed as a high court judge. From 1998 to 2001 he was one of the presiding judges of the Wales and Chester Circuit. He joined the court of appeal in 2003 and became lord chief justice in 2013, succeeding Lord Judge.

Under the Constitutional Reform Act 2005, the lord chief justice has 400 statutory duties. Key responsibilities include representing the views of the judiciary of England and Wales to parliament and government. He appears before parliamentary select committees to answer questions about the state of the justice system.

In his annual report to parliament, issued this week, Thomas expressed concern about the danger of excessive court fees driving away international legal business from London and preventing access to justice.

The newly appointed master of the rolls, Sir Terence Etherton is the second most senior judge in England and Wales and head of the civil – as opposed to the criminal – division of the judiciary.

A former Olympic-level fencer, he is Britain’s first openly gay senior judge. He was educated at St Paul’s school in west London and Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. 



Etherton became a high court judge in 2001 and joined the court of appeal in 2008. The post of the master of the rolls dates back to at least the 13th century. His appointment took effect last month, following the retirement of Lord Dyson. 



Lord Justice Sales was appointed as lord justice of appeal in 2014. He is an expert in constitutional law and formerly practised in the same set of chambers as Tony Blair.

Educated at the Royal grammar school, Guildford, and Churchill College, Cambridge, he was called to the bar in 1985 and appointed first Treasury junior counsel – a position traditionally known as “Treasury Devil”, in 1997.

He became a QC in 2006 and continued to act for the government in the renamed post of first Treasury counsel (Common Law) until his appointment as a high court judge in 2008. 



Sales has been a member of the Competition Appeal Tribunal since 2008 and was appointed as vice-president of the Investigatory Powers Tribunal, which deals with complaints about the intelligence services and surveillance, in 2014.

It is hard to think of a legal ruling with bigger political consequences than the one the lord chief justice and his colleagues handed down in the high court on Thursday. As a result, the May government’s secretive Brexit strategy will have to be rethought to comply, parliament will have to stop cowering in the corner about the referendum as it has done too often, while the welcome likelihood of MPs using their influence to ensure some form of “soft Brexit” has dramatically increased – as the immediate response to the news in the markets showed.

Indeed, the political possibilities may go a lot further. The next general election is now much more likely to be a verdict on Theresa May’s Brexit stance, a prospect that ought to focus opposition party minds as well as the prime minister’s. That election could now take place earlier than May had originally intended. A second vote on the eventual Brexit terms, either in parliament or even another referendum, is also more likely. It’s even possible that Brexit itself just got a bit less inevitable. That’s still a distant prospect, but maybe it’s worth a little flutter.

The judges have done something else. By asserting that the UK parliament has sovereignty over a treaty issue with domestic implications, the court was in fact merely restating a fundamental principle. The precedent on which the court drew went back to Sir Edward Coke in the early 17th century and to the bill of rights of 1688-89. This is why the ruling is unlikely to be overturned in the government’s appeal to the supreme court. It may even be strengthened.

That Thursday’s ruling was needed at all is a reminder of how much in the British political and democratic system still needs fixing. On the one hand the judgment reopens the issue of the medieval prerogative powers that ministers continue to claim for themselves over Britain’s place in an increasingly interconnected world. These powers have no place in an open 21st-century democracy.

After Iraq, no prime minister can in practice take Britain to war without the authority of parliament. After this ruling, no prime minister can secretly renegotiate one of the most all-embracing treaties, the 1972 European Communities Act, ever made by the UK either. This is progress.

On the other hand, the ruling dramatically underscores the uneasy evolving relationship between referendums and parliamentary democracy in Britain. If ever there were an example of the way referendums create at least as many problems and cause at least as much instability as they resolve, here it was.

Parliament is far from perfect, but it is a lot better at making good, stabilising decisions than referendums, which give too much power to a biased and bad media of the kind we have here. The case for the kind of root-and-branch constitutional rethink that Gordon Brown made on Thursday continues to be overwhelming.

Nevertheless, parliament needs to rise to the occasion. Parliamentary sovereignty is a phrase that is more used than understood, let alone exercised. If you need proof, look at the Brexiters’ response to the court ruling. If there is one thing that united all wings of the leave campaign this year it was the belief that Britain should make its own decisions and “take back control”. Unless it means rule by the Daily Mail, that means parliament is the sovereign lawmaker and judges decide what the law means – which is exactly what the courts have just upheld.

But you would never think that from the Brexiter reactions, which would be laughable if they were not so disturbing and arrogant. Ukip funder Arron Banks complained about unelected judges and sabotage. Nigel Farage said it was a betrayal that would lead to a half-Brexit. Leadership contender Suzanne Evans said the judges should all be sacked. The supposed libertarian Conservative MP Dominic Raab condemned the claimants for going to law at all. Iain Duncan Smith said the courts should not tell parliament how to do its job – they didn’t, Iain. Doubtless tomorrow morning the bullying and triumphalist anti-European press will be in primal outrage mode too.

In many respects it is to parliament’s discredit that it has done so little to force the issue and protect its rights. Instead, it has taken Gina Miller and Deir dos Santos to stand up against those who believe the June referendum is the be-all and end-all of all discussion about the future of this country in Europe. Thursday was a noble restatement of the importance of parliamentary sovereignty, but parliament itself has done pathetically little to deserve the outcome.

That needs to change. With the exception of the Scottish Nationalists, who march to a different drum, most English and Welsh MPs have been browbeaten into feeling they can’t say much about the detail of Brexit for fear of being labelled anti-democratic. Now’s their chance.

They need to start by asking for information; demand a green paper about Brexit plans and options. Labour, in particular, has to focus on the issue far better than it has yet done. Every time shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer opens his mouth on the subject, though, there is a glimpse of the possibilities.

May will not be able to duck this ruling. It is a big humiliation for her approach. She may be tempted to go for a quick one-off vote in order to minimise the problem. But the supreme court appeal, where judgment is likely to come in January, gets in the way of that strategy. If the opposition wins the Richmond Park byelection at the start of December, a leader who thrives on being in control will not want to look as if she is on the run. Meanwhile, keep an eye on George Osborne.

Until now, May has combined secretiveness with hinting that a tough negotiation stance on migration would make single market access difficult. That approach will not withstand the impact of the need to consult parliament. She must face the likelihood that both the Commons and the Lords will focus on securing single market access in ways that could split the cabinet and provoke resignations.

These things are real possibilities now, not daydreams. The courts have left May little alternative but to change course on the most important issue of her premiership.

Increasing numbers of people have been warming to the notion that Brexit may not have to mean Brexit after all. This was probably inevitable given that those who voted for it did so for a very wide range of reasons, and it is abundantly clear that the cabinet is about as unclear as the rest of us. The announcement that the UK government has lost its high court case about article 50 (Report, 3 November, theguardian.com) means that, subject to appeal, it will have to be debated in parliament. This presents a golden opportunity for MPs to throw a spanner in the works by refusing to vote for article 50 to be triggered without knowing precisely, or at least, generally, what Brexit will actually look like. When we know the awful truth I predict a stampede towards Brexit exit.

Any arguments about this thwarting the will of the people needs to be shown up for the nonsense it is. It would not be thwarting the will of the 48% who voted against and, I suspect, a high proportion of those who voted to leave didn’t vote for hard Brexit, having believed some of the lies of leading Brexiters. Perhaps we can still pull back from the brink if parliament is prepared to face the fury of Ukip and the Tory right, two groups that are increasingly difficult to tell apart.

• The high court decision is not about whether we stay in or leave the EU, it is about common sense. I have always been a reluctant remainer – not against Brexit as such, I simply believe that the decision was reached in a fatally flawed way, partly because the leave campaign never had to explain exactly what leave would mean. People were being asked to vote for a blind option.

We can’t turn back time and redo the referendum, but at least if there is a full debate in parliament we will get a proper discussion on the reasons for leaving and the options for the future. It is highly likely that parliament will vote to leave, but at least the decision will have been reached in something close to a proper process. This could make a big difference in healing the fractured and politically intolerant mood that has emerged in the country since the vote.

Ken Abbott

Portishead, Somerset

• Claims that the high court ruling is an attempt to scupper Brexit altogether are ridiculous. In addition to committing the cardinal sin of defining a word using the word itself (“Brexit means Brexit”), the government has also made no sense when arguing against parliamentary ratification of article 50.

Theresa May has stated, rather patronisingly, that any negotiator knows you should not show your hand to those on the other side of the table before negotiations have even begun. She is correct.

However, it is not implicit that anyone but parliament is able to see our negotiating hand. Parliament is able to sit in private, meaning only MPs may be present and no media coverage may take place. This was done in 2001 when MPs debated the anti-terrorism, crime and security bill.

Parliamentary involvement in Brexit will not reverse the referendum result, it will simply scrutinise the terms of withdrawal and it can be achieved without showing our hand to the EU.

Gabriel Osborne

Bristol

• “Brexit means Brexit” is a meaningless and unhelpful phrase and today’s high court judgment reminds us of this. Two words, one repeated, designed to make us forget the constitutional framework and legal process. Brexit (a consultative referendum) means (voted for by a narrow majority) Brexit (that we should leave the EU without further parliamentary scrutiny or consideration of the implications or constitutional foundations of the vote).

Our constitution, despite being unwritten, is based in law. Parliament (not the government) decided to ask the public their opinion and parliament should decide what to do with this. The House of Lords must be given the chance to do its job too – if it exists at all surely it is for moments like this, to intervene and apply perspective in a situation when the government of the day is trying to do something deeply unconstitutional. And to ensure that the proper time and consideration is given to a decision with such significant consequences.

The result of the referendum is causing divisions not just because of how deeply many people feel about the issues or that the result feels inconclusive, but because the referendum itself was not put in a robust constitutional framework, and as a result its consequences are open to debate.

Kevin Olding

• Liam Fox and Dominic Raab don’t seem to understand the high court’s ruling. The nub of the matter is that the executive cannot by royal prerogative alter the rights that British citizens currently enjoy as members of the EU. The most important of these is the right to live and work freely in 28 European countries. If we leave the EU, Poles and Romanians will have that figure reduced from 28 to 27; British citizens meanwhile will have it reduced from 28 to 1.

• What a lovely irony! Having spent months arguing for the return of British sovereignty, the Brexiters don’t seem to like it much.

• Whether you supported leave or remain, the decision of an unelected judge to prevent the prime minister from triggering article 50 is disgusting. Rarely has there been a clearer example of the establishment frustrating democracy and disrespecting the will (for good or ill) of the majority of the people.

Tim Raymond

• If the government fails to overturn the decision to allow parliament a vote on article 50 in the supreme court, then they could always appeal to the European court…

• On 3 November 1774, Edmund Burke spoke as follows to the electors of Bristol:

“Certainly, gentlemen, it ought to be the happiness and glory of a representative to live in the strictest union, the closest correspondence, and the most unreserved communication with his constituents. Their wishes ought to have great weight with him; their opinion, high respect; their business, unremitted attention. It is his duty to sacrifice his repose, his pleasures, his satisfactions, to theirs; and above all, ever, and in all cases, to prefer their interest to his own. But his unbiassed opinion, his mature judgment, his enlightened conscience, he ought not to sacrifice to you, to any man, or to any set of men living. These he does not derive from your pleasure; no, nor from the law and the constitution. They are a trust from Providence, for the abuse of which he is deeply answerable. Your representative owes you, not his industry only, but his judgment; and he betrays, instead of serving you, if he sacrifices it to your opinion.”

Three senior judges ruled on Thursday that the British government does not have the authority to proceed with the UK’s exit from the European Union without the approval of parliament. A legal challenge to the prime minister’s power to trigger article 50, the clause that formally begins Brexit, has proved controversial since being launched in the aftermath of the EU referendum vote earlier this year.

The government said the decision to leave the EU was taken by the public in the referendum on 23 June and that its executive powers, under the royal prerogative, were sufficient to give notice to the EU on behalf of the cabinet. But this was challenged by the claimants who said that the referendum was merely consultative and only parliament had the power to decide.

One of two main claimants who led the challenge, Gina Miller, a businesswoman and philanthropist, said at the outset that the case was not an attempt to overturn the referendum decision. Miller said the intention was to “answer a fundamental legal question about the powers that can be used by the prime minister and whether they can side-step parliament”.

Almost certainly not. But it does make the position much more confused. MPs are talking of the high court triggering a constitutional crisis without any indication of how to get out of it.

It also risks driving an even bigger wedge between leavers and remainers, particularly since the leavers are likely to interpret this as one more desperate attempt by the Metropolitan liberal elite to thwart the will of the people (a suspicion that is going to shape the thinking of a lot of MPs).

The government has said it will appeal against the decision and it has permission to go straight to the supreme court, which has set aside time for what might be a four-day hearing starting on 7 December . All 11 of the justices in position will sit – the biggest court ever assembled – to decide on a matter that goes to the heart of the UK’s unwritten constitution.

The supreme court will be extremely sensitive to public opinion about the role of the court, and whether it is making decisions that are more political than judicial. However both sides, government as well as the petitioners, accept that it is a proper matter for the courts to decide, whatever the Brexiteers are shouting about declaring war on democracy.

Although both Downing Street and Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, have said it will, there are plenty of voices counselling against. The high court’s ruling was comprehensively in favour of parliament and against invoking Article 50 using prerogative powers. Appealing will just add to the delay. But there are politics at play here that may yet make no 10 feel they must fight all the way.

The biggest question of all. Is a straight yes or no vote – a kind of parliamentary referendum – enough? Technically, that is possible. The risk – some say the likelihood – is that if government tried to bounce parliament into that kind of snap judgement, it would be vulnerable to another legal action.

Some sources are already indicating it will be legislation, as the judges appear to suggest is necessary. The people who brought the case argued that it would be constitutionally impossible to change the law of Britain (as of course leaving the EU would, massively) without an act of parliament.

If there has to be a whole new bill that goes to the Commons and Lords stage by stage, it will be a long and (for the government) dangerous fight. If it’s just yes or no, the vote could happen quickly - and probably within Theresa May’s previously stated timetable of triggering article 50 by the end of March.

That’s not clear. Most MPs supported remain, but most represent constituencies that voted leave. This will go right to the heart of how the British constitution works: whether MPs should vote according to the wishes of their constituents or in their best judgement (leaving the electorate to decide whether to keep them in a job at the next election).

Having said that, leave was the majority view in nearly 70% of Labour seats for example, so it would probably be electoral suicide for the party’s MPs to rebel (or perhaps even abstain). Such a move could open the gates to Ukip.

Yes, it must. That is one thing that MPs could possibly do to sort out the conflict between what they think is in the national interest and what their voters want. Although it is hard to think of a single Labour MP who would fancy the idea right now - and it would take a two-thirds majority in the Commons to trigger an early election under the Fixed Term Parliaments Act.

Of course it would be churlish not to welcome the recruitment of 2,500 more prison officers announced by the justice secretary Liz Truss today. But it would also be disingenuous not to see such apparent largesse against the loss of 7,000 officers since 2010. New recruits must be found for £9 per hour, and then there’s the training, which at 10 weeks is the shortest of any jurisdiction across the world, with entry requiring no basic minimum qualifications. There was mention in the white paper of graduate recruitment and a prison version of a Teach First scheme – all laudable but at best only incremental. It is in the workforce that the answer lies to our crisis-hit prison system (as we identified in our recent report for the RSA).

Recent analysis of the current malaise in our prison system talks of sentencing, mental health, drugs and overcrowding, but it is staff-prisoner relationships and the chasm that has opened up between those living and working in our prisons that has caused the current situation. The need for savings over the last five years was brutally translated into reductions in both numbers and experience. The process, known as benchmarking, has had catastrophic results.

As the disaster unfolded, it was prison governors, treated more like deck chairs than chess pieces, who were left to carry the can. Some courageous individuals rose to the challenge, others were sacrificed on the frequent damning reports by the chief inspector of prisons.

The issue of leadership was noticeably absent from the secretary of state’s pronouncements. There were, however, plenty of sticks with which to beat governors: yet more league tables, powers for inspectors, and the potential for the secretary of state to “intervene” (though how remains unclear).

It was David Cameron and Liz Truss’s predecessor, Michael Gove, who talked of a crushing bureaucracy preventing governors from running their jails. The white paper does nothing to address the structural change essential to allowing a more devolved approach that tackles over-centralisation and gives governors greater local autonomy and accountability. There is a tacit acceptance that governors should work with local communities, employers and services, but no mention of the fact that this can only be done if they are allowed to look outwards to the communities they serve, rather than upwards to bureaucracies that serve only themselves.

While governors and staff will feel there is little in this for them, it is likely prisoners will feel much the same. Despite what many people think, prisoners want to be safe and active, and to tackle their chaotic lives. They will not be influenced by drug testing and millions spent on sniffer dogs. Neither do anything to tackle the problems of illicit drug use – but they sound good. No-fly zones to prevent the use of drones just sound silly. Prisoners will embrace education and employment if given the chance, but merely measuring how the system fails to provide them will make little difference.

What should also be centre stage in prison reform is the fact that 70,000 prisoners are handed back to communities each year, and in that process we are failing miserably. Therein lies the inconvenient truth of another crisis denied by government. Chris Grayling’s calamitous destruction of the probation system through privatisation is seeing more prisoners being recalled to prison – less because of the risk they pose, than to do with private companies realising that there is no profit in tackling the complex issues of prisoner resettlement.

For many prisoners today there is nothing for them on the inside and nothing on the outside. Even if when released you survive, the supposed supervision process, housing and employment will remain elusive for those with a criminal record. Demoralised staff and governors meet demotivated prisoners: a perfect storm.

The white paper gives us no solutions, merely rhetoric on how bad it all is. We knew that long ago. It suggests prisons can measure their way back to success. They can’t. There is a real opportunity for change – precisely because things are so bad.

Political courage would see the abolition of the National Offender Management Service and some reduction in the costs (£500m a year) and bureaucracy of the Ministry of Justice. Liz Truss has promised five new prisons by 2020, so far there is the hint of only one. If they are to be constructed, they are an opportunity to build in new structures and designs and avoid the erection of 21st-century warehouses.

In new or old prisons, well-selected, trained and supported governors would work with and be accountable to communities through local boards. They would decide in co-operation with local providers on the skills of their workforce and the delivery of services to prisoners. It is only in such a climate that staff-prisoner relationships can be rebuilt and a safe, decent and humane prison system created.

Official reaction on the continent to the high court’s ruling on article 50 has been muted, with national governments and the European commission regarding the decision as an internal matter.

Privately, however, EU diplomats said they were worried the British court’s decision – that the UK government could not start Brexit without parliament’s approval – might complicate the process and cause unwelcome delay.



A spokesman for the commission said its president, Jean-Claude Juncker, would discuss the Brexit process with Theresa May, the UK prime minister, at her request in a phone call on Friday, but declined to comment on the ruling. 



The EU’s executive “will not comment on any issues that pertain to the internal legal and constitutional order of our member states”, he said, adding that all remaining EU members would like to see a swift notification of article 50 and any agreement would require the consent of the European parliament.

EU diplomats in Brussels and London said it was not immediately clear what the decision would mean for the bloc’s remaining members. “This wasn’t about whether article 50 will be invoked, but how,” said one.

Another EU government official said: “This may complicate things for the prime minister, but she has said the Brexit timetable will not be affected. For the EU-27, we must still wait to hear what Britain wants.”

EU-27 governments and the Brussels institutions have been increasingly tough on the bloc’s negotiating position but have stressed since the referendum that while they regret the vote the will of the British electorate must be respected.



Markets and sterling responded favourably to the ruling, with traders and investors apparently hopeful it could delay the Brexit process or make it harder for the government to push through a hard Brexit.

But some diplomats said member states would be concerned that May’s promise to trigger article 50 before April 2017 might not now be kept, stressing any delay in the exit process would not be welcome.

“The most important thing is that we keep on track with the timetable,” a diplomat said, adding that it seemed possible MPs might now seek to put conditions on May’s negotiating remit. “It makes something that was already very complicated even more complicated.”

One official said parliamentary scrutiny could “slow things down a lot, which would not be good news”, and another added: “We all know that involving parliaments in complicated, detailed, negotiations is not the smoothest way to go.”

Keen to avoid uncertainty and instability in the bloc, the EU-27 have said since the referendum in June that Britain should leave as soon as practically possible – although it was accepted that London needs time to define its position.

The EU is also eager to get the formal two-year article 50 leaving process started before the spring, both to avoid clashes with potentially difficult elections in France, Germany and the Netherlands later in 2017 and to ensure Britain is out before the next European elections in spring 2019.

It has also repeatedly made clear than Britain will not be allowed to “cherry pick” and cannot expect to enjoy EU rights, such as special access to the single market, without obligations such as people’s freedom of movement.

The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said on Wednesday that she hoped the negotiations would not lead to friction between the UK and the EU, but that the EU’s “four freedoms” – movement of goods, services, capital and labour – were non-negotiable and had to form the basis for Brexit talks.

Some EU politicians, however, were less reluctant to pass comment on the court’s judgment. “The high court’s decision is a victory for parliamentary democracy in Britain,” said Axel Schäfer, deputy chair of Germany’s Social Democratic party.

“The attempt to smuggle such a momentous decision past parliament has luckily been stopped by the court. Now … Labour and Liberal Democrats would do well to say no to a calamitous exit from the EU during the parliamentary debates.”

The leader of the anti-migrant, anti-EU, Northern League party in Italy said the decision demonstrated a lack of democracy. “Britons have voted and what matters for me is the vote of the people,” said Matteo Salvini. “This position surprises me – but I don’t think it will change anything.”

But Mercedes Bresso, an Italian MEP in the Democratic party led by the prime minister, Matteo Renzi, welcomed the court’s decision. “I have always thought the [UK] parliament should be involved, just as the European parliament is involved from the side of the EU,” she said. “For me, this is democracy.”

She said it was possible Brexit would not happen due to the decision, but that although the vote had been close she believed parliament would “probably respect the decision of the people”.

This year’s US presidential election has been part political thriller and part reality TV show. It comes to a climax next week as polls narrow and stock markets adjust to the renewed possibility of a Trump victory.

Joining Heather Stewart to discuss it all are Guardian columnists Hadley Freeman, Jonathan Freedland and Martin Kettle.

Also this week: the high court has ruled against the government in a verdict that states that parliament must be involved in the triggering of article 50 – the legal requirement in beginning Brexit talks with the EU. Legal correspondent Owen Bowcott explains what it all means.

The justice secretary, Elizabeth Truss, has been warned by her Conservative predecessor Ken Clarke that her major prison reform programme will be “impossible to achieve” unless she addresses the “prison works” sentencing policies of the past 20 years that have doubled the jail population to a record 85,000 in England and Wales.

Clarke welcomed the justice secretary’s new prison plan but told MPs she needed to “take the courageous decision to start addressing some of the sentencing policies of the 1990s/2000s, which accidentally doubled the prison population in those overcrowded slums and actually make sure our prisons are for serious criminals who need punishment”.

His warning came after the Prison Governors Association welcomed Truss’s decision to recruit an extra 2,500 prison officers to “help halt the staggering rise in prison violence” but said her package will not have an immediate impact “as the real challenge now is actually getting staff through the gates”. The justice secretary acknowledged that there are serious recruitment problems in London and the south-east.

In the Commons, Truss confirmed that a prison safety and reform bill would be introduced into parliament in the new year to increase freedoms for governors, improve education opportunities for offenders and close old and inefficient jails as part of the biggest overhaul of the prison system for a generation.

She rejected, however, Clarke’s warning of the need to tackle the inflation in sentencing that was introduced under Michael Howard’s punitive “prison works” policy and which has seen the jail population in England and Wales jump from 42,000 in 1990 to more than 85,000 this week. Truss said she was not in favour of such “arbitrary reductions” in the prison population.

The detailed white paper published on Thursday, Prison Safety and Reform, confirms the plans for a new anti-drugs strategy, to devolve budgets to governors and to introduce a system of league tables and a new trigger for the justice secretary to intervene in failing prisons.

It discloses that the prison authorities intend to tackle deliveries of drugs and other contraband by drone with trials to detect and block them. They are also talking to the drone industry about the potential to programme the GPS coordinates of prison no-fly zones into the majority of drones on the market so they are blocked from overflying jails.

The white paper confirms the plans to open the next “supersized” 1,000 plus-inmate jail at Wellingborough in Northamptonshire and says a planning application will also be submitted to build a new prison at Glen Parva in Leicestershire.

It also discloses plans to open five new “community prisons” for women as part of a £1.3bn programme to provide 10,000 modern prison places by 2020.

The white paper also confirms the commitment to a “major programme of closures” of the “oldest and most inadequate” prisons over the next five years including a plan to reconfigure the estate, which has a surplus of 10,500 local prison places and a shortage of 14,400 resettlement and training places.

Truss says that former prisons at Dover and Haslar, Portsmouth, which have recently been immigration removal centres, will not be reopened as prisons. The white paper doesn’t name Pentonville, the Victorian jail dubbed the “grimmest of the grim” and which Michael Gove identified as a candidate for closure. But it does mention another Victorian London jail, Wandsworth, which is supposed to be a remand prison and yet only a third of its 1,600 population is awaiting trial or sentence.

The white paper also confirms that the prison service intends to press ahead with anti-extremism plans to set up a network of separate specialist units to house “the most subversive individuals” in the prison system despite a recent French decision to abandon a similar system.

Truss said that the recruitment of an extra 2,500 staff, including 400 she announced at the Tory party conference, would enable a new system of dedicated officers with each responsible for six inmates. She acknowledged that there were particular recruitment difficulties in London and the south-east but said she hoped new recruits would come from the armed forces among others. A prison officer apprenticeship scheme to be introduced next year will provide 1,000 new officers and a graduate scheme will provided 40 more a year.

The shadow justice secretary, Richard Burgon, criticised the package as “too little, too late”, saying: “It’s 2,500 extra [officers], after over 6,000 fewer on the frontline. Will the secretary of state now admit that there is a Conservative cuts-created crisis in safety in our prisons?

“The root cause of this prison crisis is the political decision to cut our prison service back to the bone. Today’s announcement feels a lot like too little, too late,” he said.

A professional US poker player has lost his appeal against a London casino over winnings of £7.7m due to his use of “edge-sorting”, a gambling technique that involves exploiting design irregularities on the backs of cards.

Phil Ivey, 39, had challenged a 2014 high court decision to dismiss his case against Genting Casinos UK, which owns Crockfords Club in Mayfair. After successfully playing a version of baccarat known as Punto Banco at the casino two years earlier, Ivey was told his winnings would be wired to him and he left for home in Las Vegas, but it never arrived. Instead, his stake money of £1m was returned to him.

Genting, which owns more than 40 casinos in the UK, said edge-sorting, which Ivey used to gain a competitive advantage, was not a legitimate strategy and the casino had no liability to him.

The tactic allows players to predict whether a card may be high or low – and therefore beneficial to their hand – by finding tiny irregularities in the back of each card.

The manufacturing process in some decks of cards causes tiny differences on the edges of playing cards. Some cards printed for the Genting Group have this characteristic, as the machine that cuts them leaves a pattern – a white circle broken by two curved lines – that is more pronounced on some cards than others.

Genting claimed that Ivey’s exploitation of the printing differences defeated the essential premise of the game of baccarat, thereby invalidating the gaming contract at best, or cheating at worst.

The casino’s chosen manufacturer, Angel Co Ltd, says this is not a defect and is within a contractually specified tolerance of up to 0.3mm.



On Thursday in the court of appeal, Lady Justice Arden said it was common ground that there was an implied term in the contract not to cheat and the meaning of cheating for that purpose was to be determined in accordance with the Gambling Act 2005.

“In my judgment, this section provides that a party may cheat within the meaning of this section without dishonesty or intention to deceive: depending on the circumstances it may be enough that he simply interferes with the process of the game,” Arden said. “On that basis, the fact that the appellant did not regard himself as cheating is not determinative.”

There was no doubt, Arden added, that the actions of Ivey and another gambler, Cheung Yin Sun, interfered with the process by which Crockfords played the game. “It is for the court to determine whether the interference was of such a quality as to constitute cheating. In my judgment it had that quality.

“In particular the actions which Mr Ivey took or caused to be taken had a substantial effect on the odds in the game and Crockfords were not aware of this at the relevant time. In these circumstances, no lower standard applied in this case because Mr Ivey was an advantage player who was in an adversarial position with the casino.”

Ivey has maintained that he did nothing more than exploit Crockfords’ failure to protect themselves against a player of his ability. “I was upset as I had played an honest game and won fairly. My integrity is infinitely more important to me than a big win,” he said.

Arden and Lord Justice Tomlinson dismissed the appeal but the third member of the panel, Lady Justice Sharp, allowed it, saying that the trial judge, Mr Justice Mitting, was wrong to construe the issue of “cheat” in the way that he did.

Mitting had said the fact that Ivey was genuinely convinced he did not cheat and the practice commanded considerable support from others was not determinative of whether it amounted to cheating. He added that Ivey had gained himself an advantage and did so by using a croupier as his innocent agent or tool.

In the judge’s view, this was “cheating for the purpose of civil law”.

After the ruling, the Genting UK president and chief operating officer, Paul Willcock, said the company was “obviously very happy with the decision”.

But Ivey said the decision made no sense to him. “The trial judge said that I was not dishonest and the three appeal judges agreed, but somehow the decision has gone against me. Can someone tell me how you can have honest cheating?” he said.

The poker player’s lawyer, Matthew Dowd, said: “The court of appeal’s decision leaves the law totally unclear as to what constitutes cheating at gambling.

“Four judges have looked at this issue now and none of them have been able to agree on the correct interpretation of section 42 of the Gambling Act.

“It is essential that the law is clarified and, in light of today’s decision, we are seeking permission to appeal to the supreme court.”

Ivey has also been embroiled in a legal battle over edge-sorting with an Atlantic City casino. Last month, a US district judge ruled that while Ivey and Sun didn’t cheat, they were liable for breach of contract when they used the technique to win $9.6m.

Parliament alone has the power to trigger Brexit by notifying Brussels of the UK’s intention to leave the European Union, the high court has ruled.

The judgment (pdf), delivered by the lord chief justice, Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd, is likely to slow the pace of Britain’s departure from the EU and is a huge setback for Theresa May, who had insisted the government alone would decide when to trigger the process. 



The lord chief justice said that “the most fundamental rule of the UK constitution is that parliament is sovereign”.

A government spokesman said ministers would appeal to the supreme court against the decision. The hearing will take place on 7-8 December.



Thomas said: “The court does not accept the argument put forward by the government. There is nothing in the 1972 European Communities Act to support it. In the judgment of the court, the argument is contrary both to the language used by parliament in the 1972 act, and to the fundamental principles of the sovereignty of parliament and the absence of any entitlement on the part of the crown to change domestic law by the exercise of its prerogative powers.”

Unless overturned on appeal at the supreme court, the ruling threatens to plunge the government’s plans for Brexit into disarray as the process will have to be subject to full parliamentary control. 



Government lawyers had argued that prerogative powers were a legitimate way to give effect “to the will of the people” who voted by a clear majority to leave the EU in the June referendum. 



But Thomas declared: “The government does not have power under the crown’s prerogative to give notice pursuant to article 50 for the UK to withdraw from the European Union.” 



The international trade secretary, Liam Fox, said the government was disappointed by the high court decision but added that “the government is determined to respect the result of the referendum”. 



The Ukip leader, Nigel Farage, said he was angered by the decision. “I worry that a betrayal may be near at hand … I now fear that every attempt will be made to block or delay the triggering of article 50. If this is so, they have no idea of the level of public anger they will provoke.”

The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said: “This ruling underlines the need for the government to bring its negotiating terms to parliament without delay. Labour respects the decision of the British people to leave the European Union. But there must be transparency and accountability to parliament on the terms of Brexit.”

The Lib Dem leader, Tim Farron, said he was delighted by the ruling. “Given the strict two-year timetable of exiting the EU once article 50 is triggered, it is critical that the government now lay out their negotiating to parliament, before such a vote is held,” he said.

By handing responsibility for initiating Brexit over to MPs, the three senior judges – Thomas, the master of the rolls, Sir Terence Etherton, and Lord Justice Sales – have ventured on to constitutionally untested ground.

The legal dispute focused on article 50 of the treaty on European Union, which says any member state may leave “in accordance with its own constitutional requirements” – an undefined term that has allowed both sides to pursue rival interpretations.

The decision may undermine the prime minister’s authority in conducting negotiations with other EU states in the run-up to the UK’s withdrawal.

Gina Miller, the lead claimant in the case, said: “It was the right decision because we were dealing with the sovereignty of parliament. It was not about winning or losing. It was about what was right. Now we can move forward with legal certainty.”

Deir Dos Santos, a hairdresser and the other lead claimant, said: “Today’s judgment is a victory for everyone who believes in the supremacy of our parliament and the rule of law. I have never challenged the result of the referendum – in fact I voted for Brexit for the sole reason that I wanted power to be returned from Europe to the British parliament. But I did not think it was right for the government then just to bypass parliament and try to take away my legal rights without consulting parliament first.”



John Halford, the solicitor at Bindmans who represented the People’s Challenge group, said: “The oversight, control and democratic accountability needed for decisions on Brexit have to match the consequences of those decisions for UK citizens. That is why our constitution empowers parliament, not the government, to take decisions.”

John Shaw, chair of the organisation Fair Deal for Expats, said: “This is superb news. We were convinced that our case was just. We’re delighted that the court agrees with us. There now needs to be a proper debate about how the rights of expats will be protected.”

The three judges’ ruling was unanimous. It stated: “By making and unmaking treaties the crown [ie the government] creates legal effects on the plane of international law, but in doing so it does not and cannot change domestic law. It cannot without the intervention of parliament confer rights on individuals or deprive individuals of rights.”

At one point the judgment dismisses arguments deployed by lawyers for the government – about whether rights within the EU were conferred by act of parliament or international treaty – as being “divorced from reality”.

The judges said: “The reality is that parliament knew and intended that enactment of the European Communities Act 1972 would provide the foundation acquisition by British citizens of rights under EU law which they could enforce in other member states.

They added that “the claimants are entitled to say that it would be surprising if they could be removed simply through action by the crown under its prerogative powers”.

They concluded: “In our judgment, the clear and necessary implication from these provisions taken separately and cumulatively is that parliament intended EU rights to have effect in domestic law and that this effect should not be capable of being undone or overridden by action taken by the crown in exercise of its prerogative powers.”

Part of the judges’ reasoning was based on legal precedents dating back to the 13th century, in particular the Case of Proclamations. That case involved merchants who were prevented from working in London by proclamation of Henry IV which was found to be in breach of a parliamentary act dating back to 1297. Parliament triumphed and the crown had to withdraw its ban.

A momentous constitutional decision was taken by the high court of England and Wales this morning. A prime minister’s absolute power to do what they like, when they like, regardless of laws and treaties, was struck down. Theresa May cannot tear up our right to be EU citizens without the authority of parliament. Those rights were bestowed by parliamentary votes in a series of treaties. She can’t high-handedly abandon them and trigger our exit from the EU without parliament’s agreement.

Judges, wisely, do not generally want to usurp the power of elected governments to govern. Laws made by judges are a poor substitute for those made by elected MPs in parliament. But this is a matter of the profoundest constitutional importance, with deep implications, controversial whichever way they had decided. They rightly pronounced that parliament is sovereign – which is what the Brexiters claimed we were voting on, until it no longer suited them.

What now? The government will appeal to the supreme court in December, though some suggest May should dash to the Commons immediately for a quick vote, before an as-yet hazy coalition of cross-party remainers has time to organise and solidify. If the appeal fails, will MPs galvanise? Leaving it to the unelected Lords is no answer.

There are times when MPs need to rise above their party interests, their own interests and the views of their constituents. That may risk being voted out, but they may earn more respect by standing up for the national interest as best they can determine: that’s what representative democracy is for. In times of war or national crisis, defending the country from grave error, at whatever personal cost, is their duty. Brexit is the greatest threat to national wellbeing since the war, and this will test the mettle not just of individual MPs, but of the nature and purpose of a representative democratic system.

How difficult and brave that is: Labour MPs are painfully mindful that 70% of their seats returned majorities in favour of Brexit. Raucous anger against any parliamentary attempt to let the country pause for thought is bellowed out daily by the Tory press denouncing all 48% of remain voters as an anti-democratic remoaning metropolitan elite. Stifling all experts just for being experts, intimidating even the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, is a bullying demagoguery that paralyses many who should speak out. A non-binding referendum, voted on amid a thicket of utterly cynical lies and promises, cannot be a tombstone block to the judgment of MPs on this vital matter of national interest. It’s not anti-democratic to try to stop what so many other countries see as an incomprehensible act of economic suicide.

Why does the government fight so hard against what would almost certainly be a parliament that folded instantly on an article 50 vote? Because during such a debate they would have to bring forward some kind of plan for how they will negotiate Brexit. No such plan exists, because the split cabinet could not possibly agree even a vague outline to satisfy both Liam Fox and Damian Green. Even a wishlist of impossibilities would be impossible, with the demented John Redwood/Daily Express faction calling daily for an immediate crashing out, with no deals and no treaties.

Best news of the day came from a BBC interview with Lord Kerr, former head of the foreign office and ambassador to the US and the EU. It was he who drafted Article 50 and he says: “It is not irrevocable. You can change your mind while the process is going on.”

The pound soared following today’s high court news because markets are idiotic, shaped by punters second-guessing one another’s idiocy. This doesn’t suggest, alas, that Brexit is much closer to being reconsidered. Reality will take the pound back down, predicted to sink further with each step towards to the exit gate. Next year’s prices will rise, NIESR reckons, by 4%, hitting those who are “just managing” even harder.

Every day another bad effect is revealed before anything has even happened. Today reveals an acute labour shortage in the food processing industries, as east Europeans are reluctant to come here. The shrinking pound decreases the value of their pay, and they hear awful stories of racist attacks and abuse. Without actually leaving, we are already keeping EU immigrants away. The damage is beginning already.

The latest regreters are the £4bn curry house operators, who voted out. They were lied to outright, as Priti Patel and others told them fewer EU migrants would open the door to the chefs they desperately need and promised a points-based system to let chefs in. This has now been reneged on. There will be massive closures, they say. How naive could they be? A public stirred by Mail and Sun anti-migrant horror stories were made even more fearful of Muslim refugees pouring than of Poles: of course the government now says the screw is tightening and there will be no more Asian visas. Others too will find how badly they were lied to.

There is time for people to change their mind, and polls suggest opinion is on the move. The vote was narrow. But MPs can’t wait for public opinion to shift by itself. They have a role to play - as leaders not as followers. Today’s judgment tells them exactly that.

Once in a while, by mistake, Boris Johnson tells a truth: “Brexit means Brexit and we are going to make a titanic success of it”, he said last night at the Spectator awards. Yes, we are on the Titanic and he’s the captain. God help us. Can parliament help save us from him and the damage he has done before we sink?
###########################################################
Surely those who should be cheering today’s high court judgment the loudest are the people who have been the most passionate defenders of parliamentary sovereignty. So rejoice, Daniel Hannan: the judges have heeded your earnest plea to make parliament supreme. Put out the bunting, Michael Gove: your insistence that Westminster be the ultimate arbiter of our national affairs has been given the judicial seal of approval. Let all those who spent the spring trumpeting the glory of England, hailing it as the mother of parliaments, now celebrate their victory.

Except, of course, they won’t. Those who campaigned for leave in the name of wresting power from Brussels to Westminster went strangely quiet when it came to the question decided by the court today: who has the power to trigger article 50? Suddenly they found that parliament was not quite so sacred or central – that some things were best left to ministers to decide. Well, the judges have called out that hypocrisy. They have decided that the Brexiteers should have to comply with their own logic – and bow to parliament.

Does that mean, as Nigel Farage has said he fears, that a “betrayal” is imminent – that parliament might opt for a “half Brexit”, as the former Ukip leader put it, or even that it might halt Brexit altogether? You can see why that’s a possibility: the remain camp still has a majority in the Commons, when you add up not just Labour, the SNP and the Liberal Democrats but also the estimated 185 Tory MPs who wanted to stay in the EU. If they all united and voted as they did on 23 June, they could block Brexit tomorrow.

They won’t do that. Too many would regard it as a constitutional offence to go against the public’s verdict delivered in the referendum. Others have a more practical fear of contradicting the wishes of their own local electorate, anxious they would pay the price with their own seats.

But that fear will only fully kick in if Theresa May presents them with a straight, up-or-down choice: a one-line motion to trigger article 50 or not. If the choice is any less stark than that, if May proposes detailed legislation – then that would give anti-Brexit MPs plenty of wriggle room. They could say that while the public voted to leave, they did not vote for this kind of leave. That would give the remain majority in parliament the chance to slow things down and demand a much softer Brexit.

Two other factors could prove decisive. The coherence of Labour in parliament now matters. If the party can get its act together and unite around, say, the demand that Britain remains a member of the single market then it will have real muscle. The early signs were not encouraging: recall that the first public figure to demand the immediate triggering of article 50 was Jeremy Corbyn, hours after the vote. But Keir Starmer and others have set a good lead: Labour needs to press the case against hard Brexit strongly and coherently.

The other thing to remember is that parliament is not just the Commons. The Lords will have a say too. Unelected peers thwarting the will of the people may look like a democratic outrage. But Gove, Hannan and the rest can hardly complain. The Lords are an ancient part of our parliament. And parliament – as they never stopped reminding us – is sovereign.

For those of us who voted leave in order to ensure that it’s our MPs who make political decisions in this country, this morning’s ruling in the high court is a nice irony. I personally don’t have a problem with anyone using any democratic or legal means to achieve any political end they want. And there’s no doubt that MPs have the right to cancel Brexit if they choose to do so.

But I would advise them to use their power respectfully and wisely. The reputation of the political classes in this country is already very low, and any attempt to overturn the referendum result is likely to send it down even further with baleful consequences.

Whether it’ll make any difference in the long run is a moot point. There are powerful vested interests in the UK already at work to get the ballot overturned or render it meaningless. There are equally powerful interests in the EU itself who are willing to help them out. Personally, I wouldn’t bet against them succeeding. As the French, Dutch, Irish and Greeks have discovered, referendums in the EU are flexible friends. But that will leave a pertinent question – do votes actually count for anything in Europe these days, or are they merely glorified opinion polls?

Given the Conservative party’s long-standing commitment to the principles of parliamentary representative democracy, it is disappointing that today’s decision had to be made in the court. Ironically, a failure to consult elected representatives of the public on the terms of the negotiation package would undermine the very principles that David Davis, Boris Johnson and Liam Fox have championed. Hopefully, this will provide some much-needed clarity on what has been a completely chaotic showing from the government so far.

It will be vital that parliament now works productively together to get the best possible negotiating deal to take to Europe. Given the strict two-year timetable of exiting the EU once article 50 is triggered, it is critical that the government now lays out its negotiations to parliament, before such a vote is held. So far, May’s team have been all over the place when it comes to prioritising what is best for Britain, and it’s time they pull their socks up and start taking this seriously.

Ultimately, the British people voted for a departure but not for a destination, which is why what really matters is allowing them to vote again on the final deal, giving them the chance to say no to an irresponsible hard Brexit that risks our economy and our jobs.

The government has announced that it will appeal against a judgment by a UK court that restores sovereignty to the UK parliament to legislate for the UK’s legal landscape. Even for the sake of appearances, that just looks bad. The Vote Leave camp campaigned for sovereignty to be restored to the UK parliament. It is symptomatic of their many inconsistencies that they now argue that this crucial decision ought not to be taken by parliament.

During three days of legal argument, the writing was on the wall for the government when it was forced to make the significant concession that article 50 is both unconditional and irrevocable. That might be true politically, but it is at least open to challenge legally. The irony of the government’s appeal is that it now opens up the Pandora’s box of whether the article 50 question on irreversibility can be answered only by the European court of justice. If so, what sort of delay will that entail?

In my view, the government has poor prospects of succeeding in the supreme court. The high court’s key reasoning is that the government “cannot without the intervention of parliament confer rights on individuals or deprive individuals of rights”. There is no answer to this. The removal of the ability to seek authoritative rulings of the European court, for example, is but one material change in our law, and it may have a profound impact on fundamental and social rights. So, too, other major rights merely “glossed over” by the government’s arguments. I don’t see a comeback to the various fatal gaps in the government’s reasoning, which the court found to be flawed.

The most fundamental rule of UK constitutional law is that parliament is sovereign, and that legislation enacted by both Houses of Parliament is supreme. If “Brexit means Brexit”, the court has confirmed that only parliament can trigger it. Both Houses of Parliament now need to stand up for the national interest and demand accountability from the executive, and for their constituents. The courts have done their bit for the rule of law. Parliament, on behalf of all of us, now needs to do the same.

Today’s ruling is a huge victory for our parliamentary democracy. This is what real sovereignty looks like, and this is what taking back control really means.

This decision is about parliamentary sovereignty and our constitution. It is not about leave or remain – it is actually about whether we have a sovereign parliament in this country, and as such the decision is the right one.

We got a Bill of Rights in 1689 which gave parliament powers and took power away from the executive and the monarch. Those who wanted to leave the EU campaigned on the basis of parliamentary sovereignty, so it would have been completely inconceivable for the executive to overreach its prerogative powers and trigger article 50 without any form of parliamentary scrutiny or approval.

Parliament specifically legislated to hold an advisory, non-binding referendum, so it is now important that the government puts its plans before parliament so that MPs can scrutinise these plans before the decision on triggering article 50 and beginning the Brexit process.

Keep calm, everyone. Today’s high court ruling does not mean parliament will prevent Brexit. They won’t and, what is more, they shouldn’t. Why won’t they? Well, first, because they may not get a chance to. The judgment is not the end of the story, there is an appeal to come. But let’s assume the supreme court upholds the verdict. Parliament then would have a right to vote on the triggering of article 50. Will they use this opportunity to block the process? Almost certainly not.

Of the 650 MPs, 479 are reckoned to have backed remain (including over half of Conservative MPs). So there was, prior to the referendum, a parliamentary majority in favour of remaining. But things have changed since 23 June. For one thing, elected representatives were shown to be out of touch with their voters: 421 of 574 English and Welsh parliamentary constituencies voted to leave. Polling suggests, moreover, that significantly more than 50% of 2015 Conservative voters and more than 30% of Labour voters backed leave. Voting against a referendum result generated by many of their own voters is not something many MPs would willingly countenance doing.

The most parliament seems likely to do is to impose procedural conditions on the prime minister. These may include the need to report back regularly on the negotiations – providing the kind of running commentary she has resisted to date. Yet even then, it is hard to see how MPs can materially affect the final outcome. Article 50 lays down a two-year deadline. Once a deal is struck, they will face a choice between whatever Theresa May has achieved and no deal at all. There will be no scope to modulate what is on the table.

And this is as it should be. It’s not as if politics was held in high regard before the referendum. I shudder to think what would happen if, following a unique democratic moment that mobilised the population in a way even elections fail to, a parliament that had approved the legislation providing for the vote decided to overturn it because it had come up with the “wrong” answer.

And so to the final irony. The chances are this ruling will not halt Brexit, but further legitimise it. A judgment hailed by remainers will, ultimately, serve merely to place a parliamentary stamp of approval on an outcome they oppose.
###########################################################
Theresa May’s plan to trigger Brexit by the end of March will not be derailed by a high court ruling that parliament must vote on the decision, No 10 has insisted.

May’s official spokeswoman confirmed the government would appeal against the decision in the supreme court, while claiming there would be no delay to the process of leaving the EU.

However, the ruling that parliament has to approve the triggering of article 50 has already sparked excitement among many formerly pro-remain MPs, who see the opportunity to put the brakes on any move towards a “hard Brexit”.

It also gave further hope to the Scottish government of getting a greater say in the move towards leaving the EU.

The first minister of Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon, said her administration would “actively consider” whether to formally join the next legal battle challenging the UK government’s position that it has the right to trigger article 50 based on the referendum result alone.

The ruling prompted anger among many of those who campaigned to leave, with at least two Conservative backbenchers saying it increased the chances of May calling an early election.

No 10 attempted to play down the significance of the ruling, insisting that the plan for Brexit was on track.



“The prime minister is clear and determined that this government will deliver on the decision of the British people and take us out of the EU. We are determined to continue with our plan, preparing for negotiations, and sticking to the timetable we set out,” it said.

“We have no intention of letting this decision derail our timetable for triggering article 50.” 



Government lawyers had argued that prerogative powers were a legitimate way to give effect “to the will of the people” who voted by a clear majority to leave the European Union in the June referendum.



But the lord chief justice declared: “The government does not have power under the crown’s prerogative to give notice pursuant to article 50 for the UK to withdraw from the European Union.”

May’s spokeswoman said the prime minister was working from Downing Street as usual and would not be making any public statement on Thursday about the government’s defeat in court.

May will send a cabinet minister to the House of Commons on Monday to make a statement about the ruling, but she will not be in attendance herself because she is proceeding with a trade trip to India.

The ruling will give hope to many MPs who have been campaigning for greater parliamentary scrutiny over Brexit and for May to reveal the broad principles of her negotiating strategy.

Nicky Morgan, the former education secretary, said she believed colleagues on all sides of the Commons would vote in favour of triggering article 50 but said “democracy has been asserted”.

“I am also very confident in colleagues in parliament, we are very aware of how people voted, 17 million of them, to leave the EU, and I expect parliament will approve triggering of the article 50 process,” she said. “It’s a question of law.”

The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said: “This ruling underlines the need for the government to bring its negotiating terms to parliament without delay. Labour respects the decision of the British people to leave the European Union. But there must be transparency and accountability to parliament on the terms of Brexit.”

Owen Smith, the former Labour leadership challenger, went even further by indicating he would use the opportunity for a parliamentary vote on Brexit to push for another referendum on the terms of any deal.

“Labour should amend the article 50 bill to give the British people the final say on the real terms of Brexit. Or I will seek that from backbenches,” he said. “Government must now spell out a vision of post-Brexit Britain before article 50 is triggered by MPs. Brexit means Brexit is not good enough.”

The ruling was met with dismay by pro-Brexit MPs, with Ukip’s Douglas Carswell suggesting there needed to be reform of judicial appointments.

Ukip’s leader, Nigel Farage, also said he was angered at the decision. “I worry that a betrayal may be near at hand,” he said. “I now fear that every attempt will be made to block or delay the triggering of article 50. If this is so, they have no idea of the level of public anger they will provoke.”

Dominic Raab, the former minister and Tory MP, said any attempt to stall the triggering of Brexit could increase the chances of an early general election.

“If we get to the stage where effectively [some MPs] are not willing to allow this negotiation to even begin, I think there must be an increased chance that we must go to the country again. I think that would be a mistake and I don’t think those trying to break the verdict of the referendum would be rewarded,” he said.

Nadine Dorries, a Conservative backbencher, said people should expect May to “negotiate terms, call a general election, make article 50 a manifesto promise, return with a massive majority and vote”.

The Home Office spent £63.6m covering the legal costs of the families of the 96 victims of the Hillsborough disaster, government figures have revealed.

The bill includes the cost of solicitors, experts, counsel, and disbursements between 31 December 2012 and 30 June this year.

Legal firms that received payment from the specially created Hillsborough Families Legal Representation Scheme include Broudie Jackson Canter, Harrison Bundey, Birnberg Peirce and Merrill Corp.

In April, a two-year inquest concluded that the 96 people who died at the Hillsborough football stadium disaster in 1989 were unlawfully killed and a catalogue of failings by police and the ambulance services contributed to their deaths.

The inquest, the longest running in British legal history, was established after the Hillsborough independent panel highlighted new evidence relating to the tragedy when it reported its findings in 2012.

The high court subsequently quashed the verdicts returned in the original inquests, launching a new inquest in 2014, and the government committed funding to cover the legal costs of the victims’ families.

Responding to the new inquest verdict in April, Theresa May, then the home secretary, said she wanted to ensure the legal representation scheme for the bereaved families continued and that there would be “no holding back” in pursuing criminal charges against those responsible for the disaster.

Most of South Yorkshire’s costs during the inquest were met by £19.4m of special grant funding from the Home Office after South Yorkshire’s police and crime commissoner, Alan Billings, warned that the cost of legal fees could bankrupt the force.



Commenting on the new figures, Steve Rotheram, MP for Liverpool Walton and Labour’s candidate to be mayor of the Liverpool city region, said: “The public purse could have been spared this cost and the Hillsborough families the heartache of a two and a half decade delay in reaching the right verdict, if they had received sufficient legal funding for the first inquest in November 1990.

“If they could have afforded the best lawyers 26 years ago, the injustice wouldn’t have happened. It shows yet again why, when bereaved families are up against public bodies at inquests, they need fair legal funding.”

In July, a spokesperson for law firm Broudie Jackson Canter, said government funding had been crucial to obtaining justice for the families of the Hillsborough victims. “This is doubly iniquitous where organs of state are involved as their pockets seem, by contrast, limitless,” they said.

“The Hillsborough families were fortunate to have the support of both the home secretary, now prime minister, and the shadow home secretary and most importantly to parity of funding with the police. Without this it would have been impossible to mount a full challenge and impossible to have achieved the result which we did.”

The lord chief justice is to deliver the high court’s momentous decision on whether parliament or the government has the constitutional power to trigger Brexit.

After less than three weeks considering the politically charged case with two other senior judges, Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd will read out a summary of their decision at 10am on Thursday to a packed courtroom in London’s Royal Courts of Justice.

In order to prevent leaks of the market-sensitive ruling, which involves a large number of parties, preliminary drafts of the judgment have unusually not been sent out in advance to the lawyers.

The outcome of the case, which ventures into constitutionally untested ground, will resolve whether MPs or ministers have the authority to formally inform Brussels about whether the UK intends to leave the European Union.

The legal dispute focuses on article 50 of the treaty on European Union, which states that any member state may leave “in accordance with its own constitutional requirements” – an undefined term that has allowed both sides to pursue rival interpretations. 



The arguments deployed during the three-day hearing last month appear, at the very least, to have reinforced political pressure for parliament to be given a greater role in negotiating Brexit.

Whether the high court finds in favour of the claimants or Theresa May’s assertion that the prime minister has power under the royal prerogative to inform Brussels of the UK’s intention to leave, one side or the other is likely to appeal to the supreme court.

However, there has been speculation that the government could decide not to appeal if it loses, calculating that enough MPs will feel bound by the result of the referendum to vote to leave the EU. There may be stiffer opposition in the House of Lords. 



A case heard in the high court would normally go up to the court of appeal, but arrangements have been made for the case to “leapfrog” directly to the supreme court if permission is granted. 



Space has been cleared in the supreme court’s diary for a possible hearing on 7 and 8 December. It would be heard by at least nine justices; an odd number is required to prevent a tie.



Because the initial case was heard in the high court, it has not been televised. The three judges who considered the challenge were the lord chief justice, Lord Thomas; the master of the rolls, Sir Terence Etherton; and Lord Justice Sales.

The two lead claimants are Gina Miller, a businesswoman and philanthropist, and Deir dos Santos, a hairdresser. Both are British nationals.

They have been supported by other interested parties, including the crowd-funded People’s Challenge, whose members live in England, France, Gibraltar, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. It has to date raised more than £100,000 from almost 5,000 supporters to finance the case. Another group, Fair Deal for Expats, is backed by British expatriates living abroad in 10 EU states.

A related challenge heard in Northern Ireland’s courts – emphasising the complexities of devolution legislation – has already been won by the government. That challenge may also be appealed to the supreme court and joined with the London claims. 



Lawyers for the claimants were relatively upbeat about their prospects at the end of the hearing in mid-October. The challenge has been described as one of the most important constitutional cases in generations.

At the the Conservative party conference, May said she intended to trigger article 50 by the end of March 2017.

Opening the case for the government, the attorney general, Jeremy Wright QC, said that the claimants were attempting to invalidate the referendum result.



In their final submissions, government lawyers revealed that parliament is “very likely” to be asked to ratify any future treaty agreement with the European Union.

The lack of agreement over fundamental political principles has prompted concerns that the UK’s unwritten constitutional arrangements may need to be updated.

In a speech released on Wednesday, the president of the supreme court, Lord Neuberger, suggested that “there is undoubtedly a case for saying that the time has come for the United Kingdom to adopt a formal written coherent constitution. 



“However, in that context, the typically British and pragmatic argument ‘If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it’, has obvious resonance. Having said that, there are some people who feel that it is broke, and others who feel that there is a duty to act before it gets broke. 



“But, even those people must accept not merely that the grass always seems greener on the other side of the fence, but also that experience shows that the fact that a particular arrangement works well in one country, even in most countries, does not necessarily mean that it will work here.”

Marine investigators are calling for the wearing of lifejackets to be a legal requirement on commercial trawlers after a spate of deaths at sea.

The Marine Accident Investigation Branch took the unusual step of recommending legislation as it released reports into four of the nine commercial fishing deaths so far this year.

CI Steve Clinch, who heads the branch, said: “The MAIB rarely recommends the introduction of new legislation to solve safety problems, but the rate that commercial fishermen are losing their lives due to drowning shows no sign of reducing.

“This has been a particularly bad year: the MAIB has investigated the deaths of nine commercial fishermen, and today [Thursday] is publishing three reports covering the deaths of four. All four might well have survived had they been wearing a lifejacket when they entered the water.”

Clinch said in the cold waters around the UK survival time can be measured in minutes unless a lifejacket is being worn.

“However, this message is not getting home despite a three-year campaign that has seen almost every commercial fisherman in the UK receive a free lifejacket,.

“Evidence from other countries shows that education campaigns alone have little effect on behaviour, but when backed by legislation the change is both significant and sustained,” said Clinch, adding that all trawler crew members should wear lifejackets when working on deck at sea.

Those who have died this year include father and son Gareth and Daniel Willington, whose boat Harvester grounded on rocks off Pembrokeshire, south-west Wales, in April. Daniel’s body remains missing.

The MAIB report says a likely scenario is that one of the men became entangled in a rope; the other went to his aid and both fell overboard. It adds: “Neither crew member wore a personal flotation device [PFD], significantly lowering their chances of survival.”

In the same month Craig Reid fell from the stern of a fishing vessel called Apollo as its trawl net was being hauled in heavy seas north-west of Orkney. The water temperature was 9C. Crewmates flung a lifebuoy to him but he could not cling on to it. His body was found months later. The report says Reid was young and fit but could not survive in the cold water.

The report adds: “MAIB analysis of many similar accidents shows that in UK waters a person who falls overboard, without a lifejacket, typically loses the ability to help themselves within 10 minutes of entering the water.”

In October 2015 Gerard Gillies was lost overboard from the Annie T in the Sound of Mingulay, at the southern edge of the Western Isles of Scotland. He is thought to have had a heart attack.

Three working lifejackets – which had been supplied to the trawler’s crew free of charge by the Scottish Fishing Federation – were still in their original packaging and had never been used.

According to the MAIB, the likelihood of surviving an overboard incident is five times greater if a lifejacket is worn.

By law, lifejackets have to be worn in certain circumstances in Ireland, France, Norway, Belgium, Spain, Portugal and Iceland.

Many fishermen resist wearing lifejackets because they feel they restrict their movement as they work on deck or are uncomfortable. Some argue they can be dangerous if they snag on equipment.

Lord chief justice says high costs could drive away international business and calls for more courts to become self-financing

A former prosecutor general of Tehran described by activists as a serial human rights abuser has been sentenced to 135 lashes for financial corruption. Saeed Mortazavi, 49, was found guilty of “seizing and wasting public funds” while he ran Iran’s social welfare organisation under the then president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, his close ally.

On Wednesday, the state-run news website Irib quoted a lawyer as saying Mortazavi had been given 70 lashes for seizing public funds and another 65 lashes for showing negligence in his job and wasting public money. The sentencing has not yet been confirmed by judicial authorities. 



Human rights groups said flogging was barbaric and inhuman, but called for him to face justice over his links to the deaths of several prisoners while he was a judiciary official.



Speaking to state-run news agency Irna, the lawyer Mostafa Turk Hamedani said: “We expected a heavier sentence given the accusations he was facing, but although I respect the opinion and the decision of the judge, I am going to file a complaint with the judiciary.” He said Mortazavi had been cleared of embezzlement. 



Mortazavi, who was prosecutor general of Tehran from 2003 to 2009, fell from grace because of his links to the deaths in custody of at least three protesters after the disputed 2009 presidential election that gave Ahmadinejad a second term as president. 



While in office, Mortazavi tightened controls on the press, closing down 18 newspapers within two days, and handing down lengthy jail sentences to protesters and activists. He was linked to the case of Zahra Kazemi, an Iranian-Canadian photographer who died in Evin prison in 2003. 



Tara Sepehri Far of Human Rights Watch said Mortazavi was linked with “the most flagrant human rights abuses committed in recent years”, including “credible allegations of torture and deaths of protesters detained in the crackdown following the 2009 presidential election”.

“While this verdict shows that figures such as Mortazavi are not immune from prosecution for ever, justice should first and foremost prioritise addressing his role in Iran’s darkest recent history,” she said. “Yet, he also should be treated humanely, something that was denied to Iranians during his time as a prosecutor, and not be subjected to corporal punishment or other inhuman treatment.”



The Iranian writer Akbar Ganji, a victim of Mortazavi’s targeting of journalists, told the Guardian the sentencing was a “whitewash”. “It means that he is not being punished. It is not surprising – one could not expect anything else from the Iranian judiciary. Mortazavi is protected by the most powerful people in Iran. He acted on their orders,” Ganji said.



Mortazavi came under scrutiny from the Iranian parliament and judiciary soon after allegations surfaced about his role in the deaths of protesters imprisoned at the Kahrizak detention centre. Mortazavi has since been acquitted of charges relating to this. 



Hadi Ghaemi, of the New York-based International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran, said: “This sentence is yet another example of rampant impunity in Iran. No justice is being delivered here, given the extent of graft and corruption committed by Mortazavi, and his involvement in the torture and deaths of protesters in custody in 2009. Also, sentencing him to flogging, if meant to demonstrate a serious punishment, is just physical barbarity that does nothing to hold him accountable in any meaningful way.”

Ahmadinejad went to great lengths to protect Mortazavi after the Kahrizak scandal, appointing him head of Iran’s social security organisation, which provides insurance to many government and private employees. 



In 2013, Mortazavi’s name was mentioned in the Iranian parliament in a hugely embarrassing public row between Ahmadinejad and the parliamentary speaker, Ali Larijani. Ahmadinejad played a secretly filmed tape showing that Larijani’s brother was allegedly trading on his sibling’s influence for personal financial gain in a conversation with Mortazavi. Mortazavi was briefly detained after the incident. 



Amnesty International’s Iran researcher, Raha Bahreini, said: “Flogging and other forms of corporal judicial punishment violate international law and cannot be justified in any circumstances. 



“Instead of meting out brutal punishments, the Iranian authorities should be abolishing all forms of corporal punishment and conducting an independent, impartial and thorough investigation into Saeed Mortazavi’s alleged involvement in human rights violations, including the deaths, torture and arbitrary detention of dozens of protesters following the disputed presidential election in 2009.”

It will certainly help to energise and focus the Brexit process if the high court rules tomorrow that parliament, not the government, has the authority to trigger the process. As longtime critics of the system under which the royal prerogative is exercised by ministers alone rather than by ministers in parliament, this newspaper would welcome such a ruling. In any truly modern state, the consent of parliament should be necessary in a major treaty change, which Brexit unquestionably is, just as it is now in practice necessary, since Iraq, in any major UK military commitment. Yet although tomorrow’s verdict will be constitutionally significant (and may well be appealed against), the reality is that to give greater authority to parliament, though welcome, is only truly meaningful if parliament wants to use it. At the present moment, that seems far from the case.

That has to change. Brexit is the most important immediate problem facing Britain. The prosperity of the country depends on it. The place of Britain in the world hangs on it. Even the survival of the United Kingdom as a functioning entity relies on it being sensibly handled. Our party politics are being reshaped by it. Brexit will be the most consequential international arrangement made by this country in generations.

Yet most of Westminster continues to act as spectators to the Brexit process not as participants in it. Again today, Theresa May was barely challenged on the subject at prime minister’s questions. It is as though the referendum vote has become the totemic one-off unchallengeable source of all political authority on Britain’s future to which every other question must defer in all conceivable circumstances, however dangerous. This may be what the Brexit fanatics want, as they hound sceptics such as the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, and the chancellor, Philip Hammond. But it is bad democracy, bad government and bad politics. It needs to be resisted and stopped.

Today, for example, the government of Ireland called a conference of politicians, business leaders and civil society representatives in Dublin. It was held to discuss the Brexit implications for Ireland’s delicate north-south settlement, and for the future of the open border that Britain and Ireland have broadly enjoyed in one form or another since 1923, as well as before Irish independence itself. The maintenance of that common travel arrangement is a policy that all citizens of the UK should be concerned about. Though opposed to Brexit, the Irish government has been exemplary in attempting to publicise and codify the many complex issues that arise for the island as a result of the referendum vote. Yet the British government has not produced for British voters a tenth of the useful public material that its counterpart in Dublin has been providing.

It was one thing for a new British government to require a bit of time to sort out how to proceed on Brexit following the vote. But that is four months ago now. British government and politics is increasingly living in a fool’s paradise about Brexit and its implications, as well as about the timetable that will be triggered by a formal decision to start negotiations. The scale of some of the reality was made clear in a new report on Brexit from a group of independent academics and political scientists. Its conclusion is that the process, with or without the parliamentary vote on the initial triggering of article 50 on which the high court will rule tomorrow, is as complex as it is unpredictable. But the experts are clear that the process “will test the UK’s constitutional and legal frameworks and bureaucratic capacities to their limits”.

Theirs is exactly the sort of sober and factual document that the UK government is derelict in its duty by not producing for the British public. It performs the practical educative service of spelling out many of the choices facing Britain. These range from when article 50 should be triggered (as late as possible, in our view), whether it can be revoked (yes), how many negotiations are required (it’s hard to avoid several), whether there will need to be a transitional period (almost certainly), the form of consent needed at the end of the process (parliament or maybe an election, in our view) and even the explosive issue of whether the referendum is binding (in practice yes, but in law no). The fanatical anti-EU press has a vested interest in not publicising any of these. MPs and parliament have no such vested interest. Their job is hold the executive to account and to govern Britain. It is time they did so.

I reject Uber completely: not primarily because it pays drivers too little – which may now change temporarily in the UK (Report, 29 October), until Uber fires them all – but because of its injustice to passengers themselves. One basic injustice is that Uber requires riders to run a proprietary app. A proprietary program is controlled by a company and gives the company power over whoever runs it. This is wrong in itself, and often tempts the company to design the program to snoop on users or otherwise mistreat them (see http://gnu.org/proprietary/).

The other basic injustice of Uber is that it makes customers identify themselves – and records where they go. If Uber or similar services replace today’s taxis, we will all suffer a loss of freedom. The data Uber collects is easily available to the state (see http://gnu.org/philosophy/surveillance-vs-democracy.html).

If we don’t want a society of total surveillance, in which democracy becomes impossible, we must be wise enough not to give up an essential liberty for a little temporary convenience.

• Your correspondent (Why Uber deserves to be hailed not hated, Letters, 1 November) should perhaps move from the metropolis to the wilds of Essex. We have two local taxi companies, both of whom send a cab minutes after a phone call and send text messages to let me know its progress and arrival. They usually arrive earlier than promised and I have never had a no-show.

The drivers she speaks to seem to think that working more hours and driving more miles for a lower per-mile rate is a good thing!

I don’t know her circumstances but would be interested to know whether, like most of my acquaintances who support and use Uber, she herself is in permanent, well-paid employment with maternity, holiday and sickness rights and possibly private medical insurance too.

The lawyer who sent a series of tweets gloating at a tribunal victory over parents who were trying to get specialist support for an autistic child has been given an official rebuke by the Solicitors’ Regulation Authority.



Mark Small, the director of Baker Small Legal Services, caused outrage in June when he celebrated on Twitter “a great win” over a family seeking educational needs [SEN] support for their child. As well as being formally rebuked by the authority, he was ordered to pay £600 costs.

In the ruling, the SRA noted: “Members of the public regarded the tweets as unprofessional and offensive. The publication of the tweets received extensive coverage in the media and generated a number of complaints to the firm and the SRA … Mr Small admits that the content of the tweets was unprofessional and offensive and as such he failed to behave in a way that maintains the trust the public places in him and in the provision of legal services.”

One of the tweets said: “Crikey, had a great ‘win’ last week which sent some parents into a storm!” Another message celebrated a tribunal victory over an attempt by parents to get funding for Applied Behavioural Analysis (ABA), a widely respected intervention that can help autistic children to learn. He said: “Great ABA Trib win this week … interesting to see how parents continue to persist with it. Funny thing is parents think they won ;)”.

Responding to online outrage at the tone of his posts, Small later posted a photograph of a kitten laughing, with the message: “Some great tweets received today from people who just see a one-sided argument … just shared them with my cat …” The firm later deleted the posts and Small said he had made a donation to charity.

However within days he had lost contracts with at least eight local authorities worth an estimated total of more than £1m.

Following the formal rebuke, Small has agreed not to act in any way that is inconsistent with the agreement.

The extreme anger at the messages, which were sent from the firm’s official Twitter account, stemmed in part from negative experiences dozens of families had had at the hands of Baker Small when trying to get local authority funding for SEN support for their children.

Baker Small was the most prominent law firm in this niche area, and its success rested largely on its ability to help local authorities cut the costs of SEN provision. Small was known among parents as “the Terminator” because of his reputation for aggressively fighting to deny or end funding.

In a now-deleted page on the firm’s website, Small advertised his skills at helping councils cut costs, stating that he had “experience of advising local authority SEN departments on a range of matters including managing and terminating ABA programmes [and] parental complaints”.



As well as being contracted to fight cases at tribunal, the firm was also paid to provide training courses for council officials, offering strategies on managing and ending specialist provision for children with disabilities.



However since the scandal, the firm has attempted to rebrand itself, and is now trying to offer services to parents who want to fight councils to secure the educational support they feel is right for their children, rather than focusing on procuring work from local authorities.

Lord chief justice says high costs could drive away international business and calls for more courts to become self-financing
###########################################################
Excessive court fees are in danger of driving away international legal business from London and preventing access to justice, the lord chief justice has warned

In his annual report, Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd also expresses concern about low morale in the judiciary and the difficulties in recruiting high court judges.

The Ministry of Justice has recently imposed steep rises in fees, arguing that the courts should become more self-financing in a time of austerity. It is consulting on charges of up to £20,000 in high value cases. 



Thomas, the most senior judge in England and Wales, wrote: “The judiciary has voiced its concern and opposition to the succession of significant fee increases which have been proposed and, largely, implemented … The judiciary remain very concerned about the implications for access to justice (for the more mainstream, lower value, and consumer cases) and the economic wisdom of the course being followed (in terms of business and commercial litigation, and the competitiveness of England and Wales as the jurisdiction of choice for international disputes).

“A properly funded justice system is a core function of the state, whether the courts are trying and sentencing those accused and found guilty of crimes, determining and declaring the private rights and obligations of individuals, or holding the democratic government to account and ensuring it acts fairly and according to law … It is therefore essential that a better and balanced means of financing the courts and tribunals is found.”

In relation to morale, Thomas said “the judiciary itself demands attention”. Recruitment has been difficult. “This is particularly so in relation to the high court, where the last two competitions failed to fill all vacancies. This emerging trend needs to be reversed as a matter of urgency, together with tackling the causes of low judicial morale.”

Judges have been affected by successive years of pay restraint, he said. “The reduction in morale, the very significant fall in pay and pensions in real terms, an increase in uptake of early retirement, recruitment difficulties and the changes being implemented through the courts modernisation programme” need to be addressed, Thomas said.

Gawker Media has agreed to pay former wrestler Hulk Hogan $31m (£25m) to settle a long-running legal battle that forced the company to file for bankruptcy and its eponymous gossip website to close down.



The news site, which filed for bankruptcy this summer after a jury ordered it to pay $140m in damages to Hogan for the website’s publication of a sex tape featuring the wrestler, agreed to forego an appeal and pay a cash settlement deal, according to legal filings on Wednesday. The lawsuit against Gawker was funded by Silicon Valley billionaire and Donald Trump donor Peter Thiel.

After four years of litigation funded by a billionaire with a grudge going back even further, a settlement has been reached, Gawker founder Nick Denton said in a blog post. “The saga is over.”

Denton, a British journalist who founded Gawker in 2002 with an aim to report on the media and establishment elite, said he was confident that the appeals court would reduce or eliminate the $140m “runaway Florida judgment”.

“But all-out legal war with Thiel would have cost too much, and hurt too many people, and there was no end in sight. The Valley billionaire, famously relentless, had committed publicly to support Hulk Hogan beyond the appeal and ‘until his final victory’. Gawker’s nemesis was not going away.”

As part of the settlement, three Gawker stories, including the Hogan one, will be deleted from the internet.

A spokesman for Hogan, whose real name is Terry Bollea, said: “As with any negotiation for resolution, all parties have agreed it is time to move on.”

Thiel, a co-founder of PayPal and an early investor in Facebook, has spent about $10m sponsoring the lawsuit against Gawker. He had also secretly funded a team of lawyers to track down “victims” of Gawker and help fund their lawsuits against the company.

He fell out with Gawker and Denton after the website outed him as gay in 2007 with the headline: “Peter Thiel is totally gay, people.” Denton is also gay.

“It’s less about revenge and more about specific deterrence,” Thiel has said of sponsoring Hogan’s legal action. “I saw Gawker pioneer a unique and incredibly damaging way of getting attention by bullying people even when there was no connection with the public interest … I thought it was worth fighting back.” He said funding the lawsuit was one of the “greater philanthropic things that I’ve done”.

Gawker Media, which included several other websites including Jezebel, Gizmodo and Deadspin, was sold out of bankruptcy to US-based Spanish-language media company Univision for $135m. Gawker was permanently closed.

Gawker started life in Denton’s Manhattan apartment with a mission to expose celebrities and the media elite. It quickly became popular for its “snarky” tone and abhorrence of PR and media spin.

A British couple have abandoned a fight to regain care of their child despite being cleared of abuse at a criminal trial.

The man and woman had complained of being victims of a miscarriage of justice because their child had been adopted when they had not been convicted of any offence.

However, they now say that taking the child away from the adoptive parents would be wrong.

Local authority social services had raised concerns shortly after the child was born, leading to a family court judge making several findings, on balance of probabilities, against the child’s biological parents. The child was placed with prospective adoptive parents in 2014, and was adopted by them the following year.

The couple had also been accused of harming the child and prosecuted. But last year they were acquitted when a crown court judge concluded there was no case to answer.

A senior judge is currently re-examining the case at a hearing in the family division of the high court. Sir James Munby, the most senior family court judge in England and Wales, began analysing evidence in mid-October after the couple challenged the findings made by a family court judge in 2013.

He said the couple had made it clear that if they succeeded in overturning the 2013 findings they would seek a revocation of the adoption order and try to regain care of their child.

On Wednesday, however, Munby revealed that the couple had decided to give up their fight. The judge said both had notified the court that they no longer wished to challenge the family court judge’s 2013 findings. He said the couple had outlined their feelings in witness statements.

“We knew from the beginning that even if the family court cleared us this time, we might not get (X) back,” the mother had said.

“We now know that it is too late to move (X) from the adoptive parents. This would not be the right thing for (X).”

She had added: “I want (X) to know that we would never hurt (X), but I cannot go through [another] long court hearing where I am accused again of lying to cover up hurting (X) or to cover up for (the father) hurting (X).

The father had told Munby: “The idea of taking (X) away from all (X) knows is not something I can live with.

He had added: “The best way I think I can express my love for (X) now is to make it clear (X) should remain in the care of the adoptive parents.”

Munby said he had decided that the new hearing would continue in spite of the couple’s change of heart. The judge said it was in the child’s interests – and the public interest – that “the truth” was ascertained.

He added that the fairness and validity of the process would not be compromised by the absence of the couple and their lawyers.

Munby said nothing could be reported that might identify the child, including the child’s sex.

The verdict is in and the government is guilty. In a landmark ruling, the high court has ruled that the plans to cut fatal air pollution are not only inadequate, but also illegal. To anyone who has seen these plans, the verdict is not surprising.

“If there was a toxin in our water system that we knew was killing thousands of people every year, the government would be coordinating Cobra meetings every day,” Matthew Pennycook, the Labour MP for Greenwich and chair of parliament’s cross-party group on air pollution, said after this morning’s ruling. But when it comes to the fatal toxins in our air, the government has not been coordinating any emergency meetings. It has been moving at a snail’s pace.

Air pollution is a known killer. The UK has been in breach of legal limits on nitrogen dioxide (NO2) for years. The government’s own reports show air pollution is causing 40-50,000 deaths every year, by exacerbating respiratory illnesses, heart disease and asthma. New evidence suggests it is not only finding its way into our lungs, but into our brains too, where it may bring about the premature onset of Alzheimer’s disease. In the words of MPs from all parties, we are facing a public health crisis.

Theresa May has pledged that she will fight the “burning injustices” that entrench social inequality and blight the life chances of children from working-class families. She says that many in Westminster “don’t know what it’s like to live like this and need to be told that what the government does isn’t a game”. But perhaps the prime minister is among them.

Children know that air pollution is not a game because they are substantially more vulnerable to toxins in the air, which permanently stunt the development of their lungs. So too are people from ethnic minority backgrounds, those living in areas of higher levels of deprivation, the elderly and those with chronic health conditions. In short, they are the most vulnerable people in our society.

Yet still, the apathy persists. It has now been more than a year since the Volkswagen scandal broke, when a major car manufacturer was revealed to have been covering up air pollution through criminal activity. In the US, VW has agreed to pay $15.3bn to compensate consumers and mitigate some of the damage it has done to the environment. In the UK the government has failed to take legal action or compensate consumers – all while lobbying at an EU level to water down regulations that would encourage the car industry to change. Indeed, the only reason the government has an air quality plan at all is because the supreme court ordered it to draw one up 18 months ago.

So what now? Speaking at prime minister’s questions today, May promised that the government did not “doubt the importance of the issue” and would look again at the proposals. She is right, it will – because it will have to. It now has one week to negotiate with the NGO ClientEarth, which emerged victorious from the high court this morning. It will be forced to scrap its current air quality plan, which called for clean air zones in just five cities, and backed the mayor’s plans in London, but did not mandate change in major cities such as Manchester and industrial hot spots such as Port Talbot.

Any new plan is likely to implement clean air zones in many more cities and could mean that diesel cars will face charges in many city centres. But the government should ensure local authorities have proper resources to implement the zones. It is also likely the government will have to redo the flawed modelling on which its current plans are based, which fail to properly take into account the vast discrepancy between tests in the laboratory and tests on the road.

But even this is likely to be inadequate. Road transport is the number one contributor to NO2 pollution and diesel is the main culprit. Yet we currently have a tax system that incentivises consumers to purchase diesel cars, which currently make up close to half of the nation’s fleet. Research published today suggests that for central London to become compliant, the proportion of diesel cars on the road would need to be as low as 5%. The sale of diesel cars must end and the government must reform a regulator that hauls in millions from the car industry itself.

But the car industry does not have to be the villain in this story. May has the opportunity to make it the hero and deliver a boost to the government’s shiny new industrial strategy to boot. Both Norway and the Netherlands understand this – they are striving for an emissions-free industry within the decade. China has announced a boost to its hybrid industry and even Germany, the nation that invented the car, is now mooting a federal proposal for a ban on petrol and diesel by 2030.

Electrics, hybrids and hydrogen are the future of the global car industry. If the UK doesn’t move fast by delivering the incentives and infrastructure required to clean it up, we will get left behind. If the prime minister realises this opportunity, perhaps then she might really start to play the game.

Women from Northern Ireland who travel to England to terminate pregnancies are being treated as “second-class citizens” by the NHS, the supreme court has been told.

The health service’s refusal to fund abortions for Northern Irish women is a breach of their human rights and NHS guidelines, the panel of five justices at the UK’s highest court heard on Wednesday.

The barrister was opening a legal challenge brought on behalf of a woman , identified only as A , who travelled to Manchester in 2012 aged 15, at a cost of £300, and was required to pay £600 for an abortion .



Abortion is only available in Northern I rish hospitals when there is a direct threat to the mother’s life if the pregnancy continues. In all other cases, abortion is illegal.



An estimated 2,000 women travel to English hospitals and clinics from Northern Ireland every year for terminations. All of them have to find enough money to go to private clinics in England .

Stephen Cragg QC, representing A and her mother, told the court: “When it comes to abortion services , women from Northern Ireland are essentially second-class citizens.

“Criminal penalties are still imposed on those who seek access to abortion services in Northern Ireland. Life imprisonment is still on the statute books. The most recent penalty was a three-month suspended sentence for a woman who accessed [abortion] drugs via the internet .



“It’s not surprising that, as the mother explains in this case, this was far more stressful and humiliating for a 15-year-old girl than it needs to be.”

One of the justices, Lord Reed, questioned whether the case could set a broader precedent across the devolved regions by making other services, such as university, free for all UK citizens. Cragg said this was not the desired outcome of the claim.

“The law governing abortion in Northern Ireland is one of the most restrictive in both the European Union and [within] the Council of Europe,” he argued in a written submission. “The maximum criminal penalty imposed – life imprisonment for both the woman undergoing the abortion and for an individual who assists her – is the harshest in Europe and among the harshest in the world.”

Reproductive rights organisations including the Alliance for Choice, the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, Birthrights, the Family Planning Association and the Abortion Support Network have intervened in the case.

In submissions on their behalf, Helen Mountfield QC argued that the 2006 National Health Services Act required the UK to “make universal non-discriminatory provision which supports women so as to enable them to exercise dignity and autonomy over their reproductive health, in a way which is practical and effective.

“Once a woman is within the country’s jurisdiction for the purposes of protecting her fundamental rights, then as a matter of international law, these must be protected on a non-discriminatory basis.”

But Jason Coppel QC, for the government, said it was not irrational for the provision of non-emergency healthcare to be divided between the different countries of the UK according to the place of residence of the patient.

If there were any discrimination, he argued, then it was “plainly justified”.

“A devolved, residence-based system for allocation of certain health services, including abortion services, [allows for] fair and efficient allocation of responsibility for provision of health services among authorities in England and other countries of the UK,” Coppel said.

Judgment in the case has been reserved.

The high court is to deliver its decision on whether parliament or the government has the constitutional power to trigger Brexit on Thursday morning.

The judgment could give MPs the authority to formally notify the EU of Britain’s intention to leave, or allow them to block the process. 



Alternatively, it could confirm Theresa May’s assertion that the prime minister has the power under the royal prerogative to inform Brussels of the UK’s intention. Either way, the judgment is very likely to be appealed and taken to the supreme court for further legal argument.



The case was heard over three days last month. The lord chief justice, Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd, will read out a summary of the judgment in the royal courts of justice in London from 10am.

To prevent leaks, given the politically sensitive legal process, and because of the large number of parties involved, preliminary drafts of the judgment are understood not to have been sent out in advance to lawyers.

A Northern Irish teenager who as a fifteen year old had to go to England to terminate a pregnancy, is challenging the NHS’s refusal to fund abortions for women from the region in the supreme court on Wednesday.



The health service has so far refused to pay for abortions for women from Northern Ireland who travel to England for terminations.

The girl, identified as “A”, and her mother are appealing to the supreme court to force the NHS to fund abortions. Their lawyers have described the refusal to financially help women from Northern Ireland who are in crisis pregnancies as “perverse and unlawful”.

Abortion is only available in Northern Ireland’s hospitals when there is a direct threat to the mother’s life if the pregnancy continues. In all other cases abortion is illegal.

Last November, a high court judge ruled that, as it stands, Northern Ireland’s abortion laws violate the rights of women and girls in cases of fatal foetal abnormalities or where a pregnancy is the result of a sexual crime.

An estimated 2,000 women travel to English hospitals and clinics from Northern Ireland every year to have terminations. All of these women have to raise money to go to private clinics in England for abortions.

There is strong opposition to liberalising the province’s strict anti-abortion laws across the floor of the Northern Ireland assembly. The 1967 Abortion Act was never extended to Northern Ireland, and a bid to ease the country’s termination laws to include cases of fatal foetal abnormalities and pregnancy via sexual crime was rejected earlier this year.

In the supreme court on Wednesday judges will be told that in 2012, then 15-year old “A travelled to Manchester from Northern Ireland with her mother (B), where she paid £600 for an abortion, on top of £300 in travel costs.

They received charitable assistance from the Abortion Support Network in the sum of £400 without which they could not have afforded the treatment. A and B have since argued in the high court and court of appeal that the cost of the treatment should have been free for them as UK citizens, and that by not enacting this change, Jeremy Hunt, the secretary of state for health, has failed in his duty to make NHS procedures reasonably available.

Angela Jackman, a partner at law firm Simpson Millar, has been representing A & B throughout the legal process.

Jackman said: “For women in Northern Ireland who are pregnant and seek a termination, the status quo is almost unbearable. I believe the legal arguments of the secretary of State are perverse and contrary to its international obligations. Many women face the choice between an unlawful termination using dangerous and illegal pills, with the prospect of prosecution to follow, or a costly journey to England where they must pay privately for an abortion. For many women, those costs are prohibitive.”

She continued: “This is the end of a long and significant domestic journey. I am pleased that the issue is finally being given due consideration by the supreme court, the importance of which cannot be underestimated.”

The supreme court has recently granted six national charities the right to intervene in the A and B case.

The British Pregnancy Advisory Service, the Family Planning Association, Alliance for Choice, Abortion Support Network, Birthright and the British Humanist Association have been granted permission to provide their perspectives on the issue in the supreme cCourt hearing.

Jackman added: “I am pleased that the court has permitted these six charities to provide submissions in this case. Through their efforts in providing advice and assistance to women like ‘A’, and campaigning for the reproductive choices of women, these charities can offer invaluable insight into the reality of the situation for the court’s consideration.”

The British Humanist Association’s director of public affairs and policy, Pavan Dhaliwal, said denying women from Northern Ireland in crisis pregnancies support was putting their lives at risk.



“Our government’s stance in refusing women from Northern Ireland safe and legal abortion on the NHS is shameful and we believe it is a breach of human rights laws. The supreme court judges have an opportunity to rectify a situation which currently causes undue distress to hundreds of women and leaves many more with no choice but to buy illegal abortion pills online,” he said.

The case will concern A and B versus the secretary of state for health. The arguments will be heard in front of five judges at the one-day hearing.

Melton Mowbray pork pies, stilton cheese and British-made chocolate such as Cadbury’s could be under threat from Brexit, the former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg has warned.

Speaking to a food and drink industry conference on the impact of leaving the European Union, Clegg said it was possible that European rivals would start producing lookalikes to British foodstuffs if they lost the legal protection from imitation offered by EU rules.

“Outside the EU they won’t enjoy the appellation bestowed on those products and I would have thought other countries would take advantage of that pretty quickly and put products into the European market that directly rival those protected brands,” Clegg said.

Melton Mowbray pork pies have protected geographical indication status, which acts just like a trademark or appellation d’origine contrôlée and stops manufacturers from outside a region copying a regional product. Stilton is covered by a protected designation of origin, which is linked to the region a product comes from. Gloucestershire Old Spot pork is protected under a third system – traditional speciality guaranteed – which the Birmingham balti is currently applying for.

There are 73 such protected food names in the UK, including wines, beers, ciders and spirits, as well as wool. The list of protected foodstuffs includes Cornish pasties, Whitstable oysters, Scotch beef, Jersey royal potatoes and Anglesey sea salt.

Clegg also warned that British chocolatiers could soon face difficulties in exporting to Europe for a different reason. Cadbury’s-style chocolate, which has a higher vegetable fat and milk content than most continental rivals, only won the right to be sold as chocolate across Europe in 2003 after a 30-year battle. Before that, a number of EU countries, including Spain and Italy, banned chocolate that contained vegetable fat instead of pure cocoa butter.

Clegg said: “I would have thought that, relatively quickly, European chocolate manufacturers will say ‘let’s just tweak the chocolate definition’ … then suddenly [British-style chocolate] cannot be called chocolate any more.”

The former deputy prime minister, who is now the Liberal Democrat spokesman on Brexit, recently produced a report warning that foods including chocolate, cheese and wine would soar in price if the UK pursued a hard Brexit outside the single market.

He said that the promise from “Brexit enthusiasts” that a “low-cost bonanza beckons” as the UK strips away trade tariffs was unrealistic.

“This ludicrous utopia is simply not going to happen,” Clegg said. “It is a disservice to the debate for anyone to predict that.”



Clegg said that food import tariffs were there to protect British as well as German and French farmers. He added that it would not be in the national interest to unilaterally remove them as this would remove the UK’s bargaining power when it was trying to gain access with trade partners for exports such as legal services and accountancy.

He warned that the government needed to develop a trade strategy that would reassure businesses that would increasingly be demanding the same treatment promised to Nissan. The car manufacturer recently committed to further car production in the UK after receiving a promissory letter from the government.

He warned the government against “making commitments without the power to deliver them”.

“If this carries on, we will just get a series of untransparent, potentially expensive, lopsided jumble sale deals between the government and one sector after another. You can’t run such a complex economy as ours in such a piecemeal fashion,” Clegg said.

The decision by the director of public prosecutions not to charge a former MI6 official for the 2004 abduction and rendition of a Libyan dissident, Abdel Hakim Belhaj, is to be challenged in court.

Lawyers for the human rights organisation Reprieve, which represents Belhaj and his family, have lodged a judicial review claim with the high court in London alleging that Alison Saunders “erred in law” in declining to prosecute Sir Mark Allen, who was previously head of counter-terrorism at MI6. 



The 23-page claim and its appendix of secret documents – which record joint CIA-MI6 plans to extract Belhaj from Malaysia and forcibly remove him to the torture cells of Muammar Gaddafi’s regime – are the latest twist in a protracted legal saga.

Reprieve alleges that Allen “did not obtain any proper or adequate political approval” for the rendition, which was arranged with the then Libyan intelligence chief, Moussa Koussa.



The judicial review challenge was drafted by barristers Clare Montgomery QC, Ben Jaffey and Helen Law. It argues that Saunders misdirected herself about whether rendition amounts to misconduct in public office. It is a “conduct crime” and not a “results crime”, the submission states. “The crime is constituted by the misconduct itself rather than the results that follow from it.” 



The submission also claims that Allen’s “admitted failure to properly disclose conduct and involvement to superiors and ministers may itself amount to misconduct in the context of a ‘rendition’ operation, even if the public officer was unaware of the operation before it took place”.

A lengthy police investigation into the rendition, codenamed Operation Lydd, was carried out by Metropolitan detectives.

Last month the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, seemed to suggest the police had recommended that Allen should be charged. Answering questions in the London assembly about the inquiry, he said: “The Metropolitan police submitted a comprehensive file of evidence (in excess of 28,000 pages) to the Crown Prosecution Service seeking to demonstrate that the conduct of a British official amounted to misconduct in public office.”

Cori Crider, who is Belhaj’s lawyer, said: “Prosecutors should never bend over backwards to protect the powerful. But that is precisely what happened here. The CPS was so keen to excuse Sir Mark’s actions that they invented creative excuses for his conduct that aren’t a legal defence to the crimes he was accused of.

“They have treated Sir Mark’s victims appallingly, calling the family’s views ‘irrelevant’ and refusing to address a single page of the reams of evidence [given] to police. They’ve even threatened to pursue the family for legal costs when the family have offered to drop all cases for just an official apology and pocket change. Should you ever find yourself on the wrong side of the law, it seems, it very much helps if you come from the top of MI6.”

MI6 involvement in the rendition was confirmed after the collapse of Gaddafi regime in 2011 when fax messages from Allen to Koussa were discovered in Tripoli that suggested a “joint penetration operations” be conducted against the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group, of which the exiled Belhaj was a prominent member.



Barely two weeks after the abduction of Belhaj – along with his pregnant wife, Fatima Boudchar – Allen was present in Libya, it is claimed, when the then UK prime minister, Tony Blair, met Gaddafi in his tent. 



The legal claim says that while Belhaj and another rendered suspect, Sami al-Saadi, were in Libyan detention, “the UK security and intelligence services sought and obtained access to them and interrogated them in circumstances where it was obvious they were being held incommunicado, without any judicial supervision, and were subject to mistreatment and torture”.

The then director of MI5, Eliza Manningham-Buller, was said to have thrown out a number of MI6’s staff from her headquarters in Thames House when she discovered their involvement in the extraordinary rendition. 



When the CPS announced last June there would be no prosecution, it explained: “Officials from the UK did not physically detain, transfer or ill-treat the alleged victims directly, nor did the suspect have any connection to the initial physical detention of either man [Belhaj and Saadi] or their families.”

But the statement added: “Following careful review, the CPS has concluded that there is sufficient evidence to support the contention that the suspect had been in communication with individuals from the foreign countries responsible for the detention and transfer of the Belhaj and Saadi families; disclosed aspects of what was occurring to others within this country; and sought political authority for some of his actions albeit not within a formal written process nor in detail which covered all his communications and conduct.”

Sue Hemming, the head of the CPS’s special crime and counter-terrorism division, said at the time: “Following a thorough investigation, the CPS has decided that there is insufficient evidence to charge the suspect with any criminal offence.”

Allen has always denied any wrongdoing. 



The CPS declined to comment on the legal challenge to its decision not to prosecute.

The shameful decision by the home secretary, Amber Rudd, to refuse a proper inquiry into possible police malpractice at Orgreave is yet another betrayal of justice (Report, 1 November). Documents are being withheld for 70-80 years, no evidence of what surveillance was carried out has been revealed, and nor has any member of the establishment been transparent about what policies arose out of that surveillance.

Hillsborough was followed by lies and cover up after cover up. It seems Orgreave is getting the same blinkered treatment. We need to know if there were covert agents provocateur. Were local magistrates leant on by Leon Brittan at the time of the dispute? Were demonstrators stitched up, smeared and deliberately entrapped?

Could the decision not to hold an inquiry be based on the fact that no Tory politician wants to reveal that Mrs Thatcher could have been fallible? Is it still too early as too many politicians are still alive?

The election of police and crime commissioners has done little to raise public confidence in today’s police forces. Unless we can reveal what happened in the past with absolute transparency we cannot have any confidence that the same possible malpractice is not likely today.

• If the man on the Clapham omnibus should ever find himself at Orgreave, he’d ask himself, as would any reasonable person who’s actually been there, whether it was reasonable that a hundred mounted policemen and two hundred of their colleagues on foot should rock up there in battle formation on a summer’s day in 1984 on the off-chance of there being a bit of argy-bargy at a little coking plant.

The logistics of the Battle of Orgreave were trickier than those for Margaret Thatcher’s Falklands flotilla so it’s reasonable to suppose that something must have been planned. Something big. Who’d planned the stables? The field kitchens? The vets? The latrines? The medics? The tech support? The communications? The back-up riot gear? What was the contingency? The exit strategy? Did the police do it all themselves? What other agencies were involved? Who was in charge?

Reasonableness demands public answers to these and a thousand other questions. They set the context for the battle. After these, questions of police rules of engagement, of the battle itself and of its aftermath can then begin to be addressed.

But, needless to say, Theresa May’s cabinet wouldn’t be seen dead on an omnibus, in Clapham or anywhere. And the man on the Clapham omnibus would get decidedly short shrift from Mrs May’s cabinet. And so the home secretary decides there’s no need for answers and we’re expected to think that’s reasonable.

• I’m sure I’m not the only one to be disgusted by Amber Rudd’s decision not to hold a public inquiry into Orgreave. OK, nobody died and nobody went to jail. But that was only because of good luck, and because the cases that did go to court got kicked out due to a lack of evidence. But evidence does exist that the police were ordered to use excessive force and indeed fabricate evidence. Evidence exists from journalists that the BBC completely reversed its TV coverage so that it looked like the miners started the violence and not the other way around. This matter is not about deaths or jail, but about the state (ie, government old or new) abusing its power, brutalising its own people and using both propaganda and its position to cover up its actions. That is worthy of any public inquiry.

Paul Dodenhoff

Leyland, Lancashire

• I remember talking to a TV news cameraman sporting a fat lip after his previous day covering Orgreave. His point was that he’d only been able to film the carnage from behind police lines so the world could only get a police-eye view of events. While justice is forced to take a back seat by Amber Rudd’s covering the backs of her predecessors, what about a properly constituted crowd-funded people’s tribunal to hear witness testimony from those involved at the time?

Chris Kaufman

London

• I suspect that today’s chaotic Tory administration would also have ruled out an inquiry into the Peterloo massacre. The denial of responsibility by the ruling oligarchy of 1819 led to the creation of the Manchester Guardian. What benison can we expect to ensue from Ms Rudd’s handwashing?

Frank Paice

• Could the home secretary’s surprising decision not to establish an inquiry into Orgreave by any chance be related to the role played by Conservative ministers in the miners’ strike?

A Russian dissident jailed under a controversial new Kremlin law says he is being beaten, repeatedly tortured and threatened with murder at the penal colony where he is being held in north-west Russia.



Ildar Dadin says he is the victim of systematic abuse perpetrated by the head of the prison, Maj Sergey Kossiev, and his staff. He alleges that Kossiev has told him that if he complains about his treatment he will be killed and secretly buried.

A Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters on Tuesday that President Vladimir Putin would be informed of the allegations, while Russian media reported that the regional branch of Russia’s investigative committee would look into Dadin’s claims.

In response to the letter, Amnesty International has called for Dadin’s release. “We are urging Russian authorities to end the pattern of impunity for torture and other ill treatment and investigate Ildar Dadin’s appalling allegations,” Sergei Nikitin, the director of Amnesty International Russia, said. “They must also immediately and unconditionally release Ildar Dadin, and provide him with full remedy for the injustice done to him.”

Dadin, 34, was jailed in 2015 after staging a series of anti-government protests. He was convicted under a new law which criminalises public assembly, and given a three-year sentence, which was later cut to two and a half.

In the letter to his wife, Anastasia, smuggled out of prison by his lawyer, he described having all of his belongings confiscated, and claims two razor blades were planted on him as an excuse to send him to solitary confinement by way of “punishment”.

The following day he says Kossiev arrived with three prison warders and began to beat him. “Over the course of that day, I was beaten a total four times, by 10-12 people at once. They would kick me,” he writes. “After the third beating, they lowered my head into a toilet right there in the holding cell.”

He goes on to describe being cuffed and hung from the ceiling. “Being suspended in this manner brought about terrible pain in the wrists, twisted out my elbows, and caused horrible back pain. I was suspended like that for half an hour.

“Then they took off my underwear and said they would bring another prisoner to rape me unless I stopped my hunger strike.”

The prison boss later allegedly told Dadin that if he complained his beatings could be made worse, and he could be killed and buried “under the fence”.

Dadin also claims he is being beaten “several times a day” as well as bullied and routinely humiliated. “This is happening with the other prisoners, as well,” he writes.

Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the oligarch who spent 10 years in jail in Russia before being amnestied in 2013, told the Guardian he was familiar with these conditions. Khodorkovsky said he was locked up in the same penal colony in Karelia after being convicted for a second time.

“Ildar Dadin has finished up in the same prison camp, simply for protesting peacefully and for expressing his personal views. Before I was there, in Soviet times, political prisoners were locked up there too,” he says.

“It’s an extremely tough place. In recent years the prison authorities specialised in ‘breaking’ serious criminals using illegal methods. I’m afraid we’re once more in times where the new task is the intimidation of political activists.”



Russian prison officials cast doubt on the claims. “Not one physical injury has been found on Dadin,” said the deputy head of Russia’s prison service, Valery Maksimenko, according to the Russian news agency Interfax.

Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta quoted an unidentified local prison service official as acknowledging that physical force had been used on Dadin, but only when he refused to leave his cell or defied prison guards. Dadin denies the accusations.

Bill Browder, the chief executive of Hermitage Capital investment fund, said Dadin’s treatment was reminiscent of that meted out to his lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky. Magnitsky was jailed and died in prison in 2009 after uncovering a $230m (£188m) tax fraud carried out by senior Kremlin officials.

Browder said those responsible for torturing Dadin should be put on the Magnitsky sanctions list, introduced by the US and several EU countries. The act freezes the assets of Russian officials who violate human rights.

“What shocked me is that they hung him up by his wrists. It brought me right back to seven years ago when Sergei Magnitsky was killed,” Browder said. “I pray it doesn’t happen to Dadin.”

Approximately 50 people went to the Moscow headquarters of the Federal Penitentiary Service on Tuesday night to submit requests for an investigation into Dadin’s mistreatment, a photographer at the scene said.

Nastya! If you decide to publish this information about what is happening to me, then try to distribute it as widely as possible. This will increase my chances of staying alive.

Know that there is an entire mafia operating at penal colony 7. It involves the entire administration, among them the colony’s head Major Sergey Leonidovich Kossiev and the vast majority of its employees, including the doctors.

Upon my arrival at the colony on 10 September, I had practically all of my things taken away from me. Two razor blades were then planted [amongst my remaining possessions] and subsequently “discovered” during an inspection. This is a common practice here – it gives them grounds to throw all newcomers into solitary confinement, to ensure they immediately understand the hell that they found themselves in.

I was put into solitary without any official orders. All of my things were taken away, including soap, my toothbrush, toothpaste, and even toilet paper. In protest of these illegal activities, I went on a hunger strike.

On 11 September, the colony head Kossiev came to me with three employees. Together, they started beating me. Over the course of that day, I was beaten a total four times, by 10-12 people at once. They would kick me. After the third beating, they lowered my head into a toilet right there in the holding cell.

On 12 September, [several] employees cuffed my hands behind my back and hung me up. Being suspended in this manner brought about terrible pain in the wrists, twisted out my elbows, and caused horrible back pain. I was suspended like that for half an hour. Then they took off my underwear and said they would bring another prisoner to rape me unless I stopped my hunger strike.

After that, I was brought to Kossiev’s office, where he said to me in the presence of other staff: “You have been beaten very little. If I give the order, you will be beaten much worse. If you try to complain, they will kill you and bury you under the fence.” After that, they beat me regularly, several times a day. Regular beatings, bullying, humiliation, insults, intolerable detention conditions – this is happening with the other prisoners, as well.

All subsequent punishments were based on blatant lies. All of the videos in which I was [filmed] being “penalised” were staged: before filming, they would tell me how to behave and what to do – not to argue, not to protest, to look at the floor.

Otherwise, they said, they would kill [me] and no one would know about it, because no one knows where I am. I cannot send letters without going through the administration first, and the administration has promised to kill me if I write any complaints.

Nastya, I ask you to publish this letter because there is a real “information blockade” in this place and I see no other opportunities to break through it. I am not asking you to get me out of here or to have me transferred to another facility. I have repeatedly seen and heard how other prisoners are being beaten, so my conscience will not allow me to run away from here. I am going to fight to help others. I am not afraid of death. Most of all, I am afraid not being able to withstand the torture and surrendering.

If the Committee Against Torture [a Russian human rights NGO] has not yet been destroyed in Russia, I ask for their assistance in ensuring my right to life and security and those of other prisoners in Russia. I ask to you to openly reveal that Major Kossiev has directly threatened to murder me for any attempt to complain about what is happening. I will be glad if you find an attorney who will be able to reside in Segezha [near the colony] and provide legal support.

Time is against me. Surveillance footage would be able to prove [that such] torture and beatings [are happening], but it is becoming less and less likely that such footage remains intact. If I am again subjected to torture, beatings and rape, it is unlikely that I will last more than a week.

In case of my sudden death, you may be told that I committed suicide, had an accident, was shot while trying to escape, or [died] fighting with another prisoner, but this would be a lie. [My murder] would have been planned in advance to eliminate witnesses and victims of torture.

I love you and I hope to see you someday. Your Ildar.

Prison officers have suspended plans to hold meetings outside jails across England and Wales on Wednesday in protest against the levels of violence behind bars.

The justice secretary, Liz Truss, has agreed to meet the Prison Officers Association (POA) on Wednesday and to start urgent talks on health and safety inside prisons and serious problems in the recruitment and retention of staff.

Truss gave a clear hint to MPs on Tuesday that she would announce fresh measures to boost prison staff when she publishes her major prison safety and reform white paper on Thursday.

Michael Spurr, the chief executive of the National Offender Management Service, has agreed to authorise hour-long union branch meetings to take place inside every prison in England and Wales on Wednesday to discuss specific safety concerns that officers have.

Spurr has written to the POA asking the organisation to withdraw its circular asking for meetings, telling them that prison governors will “engage fully with legitimate concerns and take all reasonable action and appropriate action in response”.

The POA, which is banned by law from taking industrial action, had asked all its branches to hold emergency meetings outside every jail before the morning unlock on Wednesday. Under the plans they were to “retreat to a place of safety” if managers tried to enforce unsafe working practices when they went to work.

The decision by the prison officers’ union followed the publication of official statistics on violence in jails last Thursday, which showed that assaults on officers and inmates have reached 65 a day amid record levels of prisoner suicides and self-harm. Staffing levels in prisons have been cut by 30% since 2010.

Steve Gillan, general secretary of the POA, said the union had decided to suspend rather than withdraw its circular saying the levels of violence had reached completely unacceptable levels putting the safety of prison officers at risk. “If you do not have enough staff on the landings then problems such as prisoners not being able to get enough clean shorts or pillow cases will cause all sorts of strife,” he said.

In the Commons the justice secretary told MPs that last week’s violence statistics showed “the very serious issues we have in our prisons, including a 43% rise in the number of attacks on officers. This is unacceptable, and I am determined to tackle it. I have already announced an investment of £14m in 10 of our most challenging prisons, and I shall say more with the launch of our white paper shortly.”

Truss said there were a number of factors behind the unacceptable levels of violence, including the trade behind bars in new psychoactive substances, but she did acknowledge a clear link with staffing levels. “I acknowledge that there is an issue with staffing, which is why I have already taken steps in 10 of the most challenging prisons to increase staffing levels, and why we are due to do more in the white paper,” she said.

Two articles published by the Guardian insinuated that a Chinese company “stole” Scottish technology in the process of developing the Hailong 1 wave-power generating device (Mysterious factory break-in raises suspicions about Chinese visit, 10 October; Does China deserve a reputation as the land of copycats? 15 October). However, these reports are not grounded in facts.

Upon seeing the above-mentioned reports, we immediately sent an inquiry to the relevant company, China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation (CSIC). CSIC replied that the Hailong 1 wave-power generating device is based on independent research and development by CSIC. The Chinese company has a patent on the invention and application of this device is in accordance with all international conventions on intellectual property rights (IPR) as well as Chinese laws and regulations. In the designing and building process, the Chinese company had never had discussion with any British entity with regard to the relevant technology, nor purchased any reference material not open to the public or employed any personnel associated with the Scottish company, Pelamis Wave Power.

Hailong 1 has been designed to suit China’s marine environment conditions. There are huge differences between Hailong 1 and the Pelamis version in terms of design, appearance and structure of the joint.

China attaches great important to the protection of intellectual property rights and the World Intellectual Property Organization has established an office in China.

Muslim women continue to be the focus of public debate and are constantly being spoken about and for, usually relating to their dress or integration. This time it is on their treatment by sharia councils. Not one, but two inquiries have been launched to investigate this issue. Although I welcome them and have already given evidence to the independent government review and will be speaking to the home affairs select committee today, I wonder if anyone is actually listening to what Muslim women have to say about the subject.

Everyone wants to listen to Muslim women when highlighting their terrible experiences of using sharia divorce services, such as domestic violence victims being pressured to mediate with the abusive husband. However, when it comes to the solutions, whether it is politicians, sharia councils or secular activists, everyone seems to think they know what is best for Muslim women.

However it is essential that Muslim women are at the forefront of informing the solutions that work for them. Their voices can already be heard in the most comprehensive report on Muslim marriage and divorce in Britain, which we at the Muslim Women’s Network UK published earlier this year. The report provides information on the challenges Muslim women face and what steps they can take to protect their rights, including recommendations on how sharia councils can raise their standards and what the government can do to strengthen civil law.

Muslim women also want to inform the debate when it comes to solutions. We are so fed up of being used as a political football that, in an unprecedented move, more than 100 Muslim women from across the religious spectrum from 34 towns and cities, and from different professions ranging from lawyers, academics, health professionals, community activists to students and homemakers, have signed an open letter. Two-thirds of the signatories know someone, be it a family member, friend or client, who has used a sharia divorce service; 25% have used one themselves and others want the option, should they ever need it. Despite the sometimes traumatic experience of being questioned by male scholars about their domestic abuse, most Muslim women do not want these sharia services to be abolished. I know this is not what many people want to hear because it does not suit their political agendas. In fact, Muslim women are alarmed that some feminists are pushing their own anti-faith or anti-Islam agendas through the guise of women’s rights. They view Islam in a reductionist manner, regarding all faith practices as discriminatory and conflating misogyny and patriarchy with religious fundamentalism and extremism.

Human rights do not only have to be discussed in secular terms, they can also be addressed within the framework of religion. Muslim feminists here and abroad have long been promoting enlightened interpretations of Islam that are compatible with democracy, human rights, freedom and pluralism. So those who advocate the immediate shutting down of sharia councils are no friends, because this would result in Muslim women being trapped in abusive marriages and drive sharia divorce services underground, leading to even less transparency, higher fees and more discrimination.

This does not mean Muslim women support sharia councils that claim that discrimination does not take place by pointing to the positive experiences of women while disregarding those who are subjected to unfair practices. They have had long enough to self-regulate and raise standards but have not done so. We continue to receive complaints about their services on the Muslim Women’s Network helpline.

So what do Muslim women want? They want the government and religious authorities (whether they are mosques, sharia councils or individual scholars) to take measures to eliminate discrimination against women in all matters relating to marriage and divorce. For religious authorities this means practising the many provisions in Islam that allow women to obtain a religious divorce quickly, without duress and discrimination. Remedial action must include recognising civil divorce as an Islamic divorce and not putting Muslim women through the trauma of another process to make money or to assert authority and maintain relevance in Muslim communities.

The government also needs to step in and ensure that sharia divorce services raise their standards while strengthening civil law. Changes could include making a civil marriage compulsory prior to a religious marriage, as not all Muslim women are in legally recognised marriages. In most cases a civil divorce can then be recognised as an Islamic divorce. Making a civil marriage compulsory could also reduce and eventually eliminate polygamy. The Divorce (Religious Marriages) Act 2002 could be amended so that it includes Muslim women as it currently only applies to Jewish women. This would remedy the unbalanced bargaining power of the husband in some divorce cases where there is pressure to agree to unfair custodial and financial demands during the civil divorce in return for not contesting a religious divorce. The judge would be able to withhold finalising the civil divorce until the woman receives her religious divorce from the husband.

If these solutions are implemented, Muslim women will increasingly use the British justice system at their own pace for divorce and become less reliant on sharia councils, making most of them naturally redundant in the future anyway.

All new justices of the peace (JPs) should be required to visit a prison as an essential part of their training for sitting on the bench, the Magistrates Association has said.

The demand for the Ministry of Justice to include the visits in training, which was unanimously supported at the association’s annual conference, comes at a time when official expenditure on professional development has been declining sharply.

Magistrates courts deal with 95% of all criminal cases but a report by the justice select committee last month questioned the MoJ’s commitment to preparing JPs for service. It said the training was “sometimes too narrow to equip magistrates for the role that they are expected to fulfil”. 



Responding to the committee’s concerns, the MA’s annual general meeting in Chester last Saturday passed a motion calling for prison visits to become a key element of training.

Proposed by the Welsh magistrate John Viney and the Cheshire magistrate David Pearce, it declared that: “This AGM believes that prison visits (including to women’s prisons and young offenders’ institutions) are an essential part of magistrates’ training.”

Such visits are not currently part of formal training. In some areas, individual magistrates have to make their own arrangements in order to obtain a firsthand look at prison conditions.

Around four in every 100 cases that come before magistrates result in offenders being sent to prison.

The compulsory element of training involves 18 hours or three days of preparation, including court observations and mentoring sessions. Magistrates believe there has been a fall in the number of prison visits arranged for JPs, and that this is due to cost-cutting.

The committee’s report noted that they were “impressed by magistrates’ commitment to training and their willingness to give their time to doing it”. The MPs expressed concern about a deterioration in training – according to the Judicial College expenditure on magistrates’ training dropped from £72 per sitting magistrate in 2009-10 to £30 in 2013-14.

Malcolm Richardson, the chairman of the MA, which represents JPs in England and Wales, said: “Sending offenders to prison, within the strict parameters of the sentencing guidelines, is one of the toughest decisions magistrates have to take on behalf of society. We therefore believe that seeing prison through visitation should be an essential part of judicial training for magistrates.

“At present, prison visits vary significantly from bench to bench and we’re making the case to the lord chancellor that the Ministry of Justice should fully implement this as an essential training requirement. We look forward to its swift implementation.”

Muslim women are being used as a political football in the debate about sharia courts, the head of the UK’s largest Muslim women’s group has said.

Writing in an open letter before a meeting of the home affairs select committee inquiry into sharia courts, Shaista Gohir, the chair of Muslim Women’s Network UK, argued that while some anti-faith activists conflate “misogyny and patriarchy with extremism”, religious conservatives falsely claim that discrimination does not take place within the sharia court system.

In June, the committee launched an inquiry into the operation of sharia courts in the UK to ensure their principles were compatible with British law. The announcement followed the establishment of a similar investigation by the Home Office in May.

In the letter, signed by 100 Muslim women from a range of professions, Gohir welcomed both inquiries, but warned that “closing down sharia councils would drive divorce services underground, leading to even less transparency and more discrimination”.

“There are many provisions in Islam that allow women to obtain a religious divorce quickly, without duress and discrimination, that sharia councils should be practising,” wrote Gohir, who will give evidence to the committee on Tuesday.

“It seems that various parties, to further their own agendas, are using Muslim women as a political football,” she said. “It is therefore essential that both investigations prioritise the voices of Muslim women and ensure that the diversity of Muslim women’s voices is considered first and foremost.”



She said the committee inquiry was not hearing evidence from enough Muslim women or women who had experience of using the sharia court system.

Among other topics, the committee inquiry will look at the extent to which sharia courts discriminate against women. In written evidence submitted to the inquiry, the Southall Black Sisters women’s rights group accused the Muslim Arbitration Tribunal (Mat), a sharia court based in Nuneaton, of “sabotaging criminal proceedings” against men accused of domestic violence.

The evidence from the group reads: “Sharia councils and the Mat hold themselves out to be ‘courts of law’ but they are in fact highly arbitrary decision-making forums that use dominant, patriarchal and authoritarian interpretations of Muslim codes which are passed off as ‘sharia’ laws.”



In response, the Mat said it condemned actions taken by anyone to “restrict or impede the pathway to justice sought by any victim of domestic violence”.

In her letter, Gohir said sharia courts in the UK were not applying Islamic rulings consistently and urged the government to provide alternative civil solutions so that Muslim women were not solely dependent on religious institutions for divorce. “This could include making a civil marriage compulsory prior to a religious marriage because in most cases a civil divorce can be recognised as an Islamic divorce,” she wrote.

“Islam is neither rigid nor limited to narrow and conservative interpretations. Muslims who view Islam in that manner do not represent Islam in its entirety. Likewise, those secularists who view Islam in a reductionist manner will campaign to limit religion to the private domain and want it eliminated from all public discourse. However, our faith is not like a garment that can be cast aside as soon as we leave our home.”

The UN high commissioner for refugees has said it is “profoundly concerned” by Australia’s plan to ban for life any asylum seeker who has attempted to reach the country by sea.

“Seeking asylum is not ‘illegal’,” said Thomas Albrecht, the UNHCR’s regional representative in Canberra.

“Refugees need and deserve protection and respect. The basic human right of every person to seek asylum from persecution is not diminished by their mode of arrival. Those forced to flee persecution need and deserve conducive conditions of protection, and a sustainable long-term solution.”

Julie Bishop, the foreign minister, said on Tuesday the proposed ban was “the last piece of the work that we have to do to clean up the chaos after Labor’s border protection policies”.

Albrecht said the policy of offshore processing did not diminish Australia’s legal responsibility for people who sought asylum in the country.

Australia retained responsibility for refugees and asylum seekers, even when they were transferred to another state under bilateral arrangements. And where transfer arrangements were used, Australia retained the obligation to ensure their wellbeing and to find adequate long-term solutions for those found to be refugees, Albrecht said.

The UN’s refugee agency maintains that asylum seekers should have their claims processed in the territory of the state from which asylum is sought or which otherwise has jurisdiction over them. In the case of those now held on Manus Island or Nauru, that would mean processing on Australian soil.

There is significant disquiet politically at the government’s proposed bill – the Labor leader, Bill Shorten, described it as “ridiculous … on its face” – and it may breach Australia’s international legal obligations.

Article 31 of the refugees convention – to which Australia is a party and legally bound – prohibits states from imposing any sanction or punishment on an asylum seeker because of the way in which they arrived, or imposing any permanent restriction on movement.

“States shall not impose penalties, on account of their illegal entry or presence, on refugees who … enter or are present in their territory without authorisation,” the convention states.

“States shall not apply to the movements of such refugees restrictions other than those which are necessary and such restrictions shall only be applied until their status in the country is regularised or they obtain admission into another country.”

Greg Barns of the Australian Lawyers Alliance said if the bill were passed it was “likely to be scrutinised critically by the high court” and could be ruled unconstitutional.

“The court has made it clear the government has international obligations and that it is not above the law when it comes to people’s rights. To ban a person simply on the basis of mode of transport might be a step too far.”

The government has defended the proposed legislation, with the immigration minister, Peter Dutton, saying the legislation did not breach any of Australia’s international obligations.

“The legal advice is very clear … there are no constitutional issues here … and we are absolutely confident in terms of the constitutionality and that we meet our international obligations.

Dutton said the new law would enable third-country resettlement. “We are keen to get people off to third countries if they can’t return to their country of origin,” he said. “We are working with a number of countries now.

“What we don’t want is if somebody is to go to a third country that they apply for a tourist visa or some other way to circumvent what the government’s policy is by coming back to Australia from that third country.”

The proposed legislation is widely seen as a pre-emptive move ahead of an announcement on third-country resettlement options for those held on Manus and Nauru. It would be a legislative instrument to prevent people resettled elsewhere from then applying to come to Australia by another migration channel.

Both offshore detention centres have been plagued by systemic physical violence and sexual assault of detainees, epidemic rates of mental health damage, and acts of self-harm and suicide, including public self-immolation.

Within the upper echelons of the immigration department, it is widely accepted the two offshore islands are unsustainable solutions, and, in the words of one department official “they are ticking time bombs”, for further acts of self-harm, violence and unrest, unless other options are found.

The government is furiously working diplomatic channels to secure a third-country resettlement deal and, internally at least, believes a deal with a new country can be brokered in coming months.

Publicly the government maintains that Cambodia is a viable resettlement option for those on Nauru but it is conceded inside the department that the attempt to encourage people to go there has been a catastrophic and costly – more than $40m – failure, resettling only one person so far.

Ministers have resolutely refused to be drawn on possible resettlement countries, but the US, Canada, the Philippines, New Zealand and Malaysia (which would now be legal after being struck down by the high court in 2012) are those most commonly discussed.

But it is understood Australia’s search for a suitable third-country has extended across the globe and it appears likely any deal might need to involve several countries to clear both islands.

The rhetoric surrounding the proposed legislation, reinforcing the position that those who arrive by boat will never be allowed into Australia, is seen by the government as vital “messaging” to potential asylum seekers in the region who might be willing to consider a boat journey to Australia.

It is also aimed at those on Nauru and Manus, aimed at encouraging them to accept a third-country resettlement deal when it is offered.

Leading judges announce decision in first appeals brought since landmark ruling raised possibility of unsafe convictions

Five members of a Czech family have been jailed for after being convicted of trafficking vulnerable men into Britain and forcing them to do hard, humiliating work.

At least eight victims were made to sleep in a garage, on mattresses on a floor and even in a cupboard, and had to supplement their meagre rations by foraging in bins for leftovers. They were forced to work in local factories, carwashes or as domestic servants and one was compelled to cut a lawn using a knife.

Almost all of the money they earned was taken from them and they were beaten, punched and told they would be killed if they tried to escape.

Jailing the two men and three women on Monday at Plymouth crown court, Judge Ian Lawrie said they had treated their victims, who were trafficked from the Czech Republic, as “cash cows”.

Gang leaders Petr Tancos, 37, and his sister, Ruzena Tancosova, 36, were each jailed for six and a half years. Their cousin, Martin Tancos, 37, was sentenced to three years and his partner, Katerina Kurejova, 37, to two years. Petr Tancos’s partner, Nela Dzurkova, 28, received 30 months in prison. The judge said he would recommend all of them be deported upon release.

In court Tancosova was described as the “godmother” of the gang, while Petr Tancos was the “enforcer” who used a baseball bat to assault and threaten the victims. The court heard that the victims had not been locked up but felt trapped because of their lack of money and because they could not speak English.

One man was beaten with a chair and a baseball bat, and another was forced to shoplift, pushing trolley-loads of goods from supermarkets. As part of their humiliation they were forced to use the garden as a toilet or pay £1 to use a proper lavatory.

The five were convicted of trafficking charges by a jury after a two-month trial. They all lived comfortable lifestyles while their victims were forced to work.

Michael Mather-Lees QC, prosecuting, told the court that people-trafficking was a “spider’s web”. Police were alerted to the victims’ plight in February 2014 when two contacted the authorities, trying to escape.

Officers began a seven-month surveillance operation – Operation Triage – and carried out a series of raids on homes in Plymouth in September 2014.

Police estimate dozens of men with drug and alcohol problems were trafficked over several years, earning the gang hundreds of thousands of pounds.

I am very happy that the rights of Uber drivers are being protected by the courts, but it is worth remembering that Uber isn’t just successful because it is cheap, it also offers a remarkably convenient service which is head and shoulders above what was available before (Uber is misleading drivers about its legal defeat, claims union, 30 October).

It is a joy to be able to see my car coming down the street rather than wandering the high street looking for a black cab or engaging in repeat conversations with a minicab operator (“he’s just coming, love – he’ll be there in three minutes, definitely”), followed by a 25-minute wait, occasionally a total no show. It is amazing to be driven from point A to point B in a foreign city without having to have the right cash or speak the language. I was wary at first, because of the social implications of the gig economy, but conversations with drivers have all been remarkably positive too.

They cite a lower per-mile payment, but many more fares than working for a minicab company and control over their hours, meaning you can pick your kids up from school and refuse to work on a Friday night if that’s what suits you and yours. I have no problem with fares going up to a level that covers workers’ rights – for me the level of convenience provided by the app is priceless.

Prosecutors in Brazil have uncovered what is believed to be the biggest corruption scandal in the country’s history. Many companies have been accused of paying bribes to officials at a state-owned oil giant known as Petrobras. One of them is Rolls-Royce, which is alleged to have paid a $200,000 (£165,000) bribe to win a contract to install equipment on oil rigs. Rolls-Royce has said previously that it is cooperating with the Brazilian investigation.

Rolls-Royce admitted in 2013 that it had failed to declare that it had employed middlemen on civil energy contracts awarded by state-run bodies. Firms are required to declare the payment of commission to agents in civil contracts. Separately, Indian police have been examining arms deals involving Rolls-Royce between 2007 and 2011.

An anonymous blogger using the name Soaring Dragon alleged that Rolls-Royce paid large bribes to two Chinese officials in 2005 and 2010 to win contracts from two of the country’s airlines. One official was jailed for life, although Rolls-Royce was not named as the payer of the bribe in the court case.

A former employee has claimed in interviews with newspapers that Rolls-Royce had given £20m to the then Indonesian president’s son Tommy Suharto to persuade the country’s main airline to buy its engines in the 1990s. Suharto has denied that he received the money, or a blue car from Rolls-Royce, or that he recommended the engines to the Indonesian airline.

Fana Hlongwane, a former aide to a South African defence minister, was implicated in an arms deal scandal and in 2008 was accused of channelling large payments to secure contracts for British arms firm BAE. He was not prosecuted. A leaked document seen by the Guardian and the amaBhungane Centre for Investigative Journalism in South Africa shows that in 2005, Rolls-Royce hired Hlongwane as a commercial consultant to “support and promote” its business in the country. He was to be paid £140,000 for his work, according to the document. Hlongwane, who has denied being involved in corruption in the past, did not respond to a request for comment.

Rolls-Royce hired agents in oil-rich Angola to try to secure lucrative contracts with Sonangol, the powerful state-owned oil company, according to leaked documents obtained by Fairfax Media. Between 2008 and 2013, the company hired a partnership between the Monaco-based agent Unaoil and another firm of agents to try to secure contracts worth more than $110m.

In the aftermath of the Iraq war, Rolls-Royce hired Unaoil to help it secure contracts with the state-owned Southern Oil Company. Between 2007 and 2011, the company was particularly keen to try to secure a contract to sell three industrial turbines.

In 2008, a subsidiary of Unaoil was hired to represent Rolls-Royce in Iran, though the contract would be cancelled just one year later over fears of reputational damage. Prior to this, Rolls-Royce sold industrial components to the country through a separate firm of agents.

Unaoil represented Rolls-Royce in Kazakhstan from 2008, attempting to secure a contract to contribute to the China-Kazakhstan pipeline. According to Unaoil’s lawyers, the partnership was still active as of July 2014, despite corruption allegations having been made against Unaoil the previous year.

Rolls-Royce was using Unaoil’s help to secure contracts in Azerbaijan as early as 2001. The relationship between the two companies was sufficiently close that in 2006, as work dried up, plans were made for Unaoil’s Baku operation to be subsumed into Rolls-Royce’s international division rather than being shut down.

The Serious Fraud Office is examining whether Rolls-Royce and its agents were involved in bribing government officials to win energy contracts as recently as 2013, according to a report in the Financial Times. Rolls-Royce reportedly no longer employs the agents, who told the paper that they were not aware of the SFO’s investigation. The paper said the agents did not respond to emailed questions.

Britain’s huge al-Yamamah arms deal with the Saudis was mired in corruption claims for years. A court case in the late 1990s revealed that Rolls-Royce, which made engines for warplanes, had paid £23m to Saudi royals as part of the deal. The Guardian has previously reported details of the court case, including the claim that the money was paid into an anonymous company in Panama. The payments became public when the Saudi royals sued, claiming that Rolls-Royce had promised them nearly double that sum. The matter was settled out of court. It is unclear if these payments are being examined by the SFO in its current inquiry.

For Rolls-Royce, the stakes are high.

One of Britain’s most celebrated companies is facing potential prosecution over allegations it spent years hiring middlemen who paid bribes all around the world.

For the company, prosecution could mean tremendous reputational damage. For any individuals implicated, it could mean jail. It is a humiliating prospect for a £13bn company widely regarded as one of the jewels of British business.

Rolls-Royce is considered so essential to the UK’s economic wellbeing that the government retains a so-called “golden share” that allows it to veto decisions it perceives to threaten the national interest.

Ministers have met with the company’s representatives more than 200 times since May 2010, according to an analysis by the Campaign Against Arms Trade.



It also bears a proud history. Founded more than a century ago with ambitions to create the finest motorcars in the world, Rolls-Royce later supplied the engines for the single-seater Supermarine Spitfire, which repelled the Luftwaffe during the darkest days of the Battle of Britain.

Following the second world war, the company began supplying equipment to aerospace, energy and marine industries all over the world. The Rolls-Royce car has been manufactured by a different company for years.



So how could a company with such a stellar history find itself in such a precarious position?



The modern Rolls-Royce seeks to land big contracts in highly competitive industrial arenas. Billions of pounds in profit are at stake, with many companies seeking the same contracts. Corruption is part and parcel of doing business in many of the countries in which Rolls-Royce operates, and with so much riding on each and every contract firms can come under enormous pressure to secure an advantage.

At the heart of the allegations against Rolls-Royce is the suggestion that the company may have secured multimillion-dollar contracts in foreign jurisdictions by using agents who paid bribes.



Rolls-Royce acknowledges it hired agents – otherwise known as commercial advisers, intermediaries or middlemen – to help sell its products.

It is not illegal to hire them. These agents often market themselves to multinationals as an essential part of doing business, purporting to have exclusive access to key decision-makers or unique insights into how a bid for a contract should be structured. However, middlemen can also provide a convenient channel by which illicit cash can change hands at arm’s-length.

Rolls-Royce has declined to comment in detail on the corruption allegations since they first emerged four years ago. In its annual report in 2014, the multinational revealed that it had “dramatically” cut the number of intermediaries through which it did business around the world, a tacit acceptance that such practices were either unnecessary or inappropriate.

As the Serious Fraud Office inquiry into Rolls-Royce is about to enter its fifth year, dozens of investigators continue to examine the evidence against the company.

A fresh leak of documents from a firm of agents, Unaoil, to investigative journalists at Australia’s Fairfax Media only adds to the complexity. Unaoil represented Rolls-Royce in at least five countries, according to those documents. As such, any decision about whether or not to prosecute Rolls-Royce and its staff or executives is unlikely to be made before 2017, according to sources familiar with the investigation.

Sue Hawley, policy director at the monitoring group Corruption Watch, said: “This decision will be a key test of the UK’s ability, and willingness, to bring large and politically sensitive companies to book. If Rolls-Royce are found to have engaged in wrongdoing, they must also be barred from public procurement contracts for an appropriate length of time.”

The British government decisively failed the last such test. An SFO investigation into alleged bribery in Saudi Arabia by Britain’s biggest arms manufacturer BAE was halted by Tony Blair’s government in 2006.

Though said to be motivated by fear that the Saudis would withhold counter-terrorism intelligence should the investigation proceed, few anti-corruption specialists saw the decision as the UK’s finest moment.



So the Rolls-Royce inquiry is important for the SFO too.

Theresa May was widely reported to view the agency as an unsuccessful anachronism while home secretary, and taken with the idea that its fraud and bribery functions might be folded into her new National Crime Agency.

However, anti-corruption campaigners oppose such a move, and the agency may have earned a reprieve after this year securing the convictions of bankers who manipulated the Libor rates. The agency also appears to have become more proactive, establishing a new intelligence unit that follows up reports from journalists or NGOs rather than waiting for tip-offs to present themselves.



Even if the SFO were to conclude it possessed sufficient evidence to prosecute Rolls-Royce, it could opt for a course of action that would inflict less collateral damage to the many entirely innocent employees and suppliers that depend on Rolls-Royce for their livelihoods.



A deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) would, instead of a full criminal prosecution of the company, entail the presentation of an agreed statement of facts to a court, laying out the details of the company’s conduct, as well as a large fine.



Such an approach may be considered suitable for Rolls-Royce given the company’s parlous financial health: it sold its energy business to Siemens in May 2014, and issued its fifth profit warning (paywall) in 20 months in September this year. 



However, DPAs are controversial. After HSBC was awarded one, along with a record $1.9bn fine, in 2012 after it admitted laundering money for Mexican drug cartels, the New York Times damned the settlement as “a dark day for the rule of law” and an effective admission that the company was too big to prosecute.



As a less harsh outcome to a prosecution, such settlements are obviously attractive to companies that find themselves in the SFO’s crosshairs.



But to be seen to treat a defendant with kid gloves could prompt the SFO’s critics to accuse it of being soft on crime, and would raise questions around fairness were any of the company’s agents to be subject to full prosecution.

When Sir John Rose stepped down as chief executive of Rolls-Royce in March 2011, the company had been transformed.

The so-called “Lion of Rolls-Royce” had been in charge for 15 years and overseen the expansion of one of Britain’s best-known blue-chip companies into an engineering giant on the world stage.

The firm that had made engines for Spitfires during the second world war had become a £13bn leviathan. Yet, cracks in its carefully crafted corporate image were about to emerge.

Exactly how it started is still unclear, but by December 2012, Rolls-Royce had put itself on red alert. It acknowledged, somewhat opaquely, that it had a problem – and the Serious Fraud Office said it was investigating.

At first, the SFO focused on the company’s activities in the emerging markets of India and China, but the list of jurisdictions was to grow.

Before long, the SFO declared it had opened a criminal investigation into allegations of bribery and corruption at Rolls-Royce.

In an unusual move, the company, which had conducted its own internal review of its business, made clear the seriousness of the situation. “It is too early to predict the outcomes, but these could include the prosecution of individuals and of the company. We will cooperate fully,” Rolls-Royce said.

In an effort to get ahead of the problem, but in a way that underlined its predicament, the company appointed Lord Gold, a former head of litigation at City law firm Herbert Smith, to review Rolls-Royce’s “compliance procedures”.

Four years since the first reports of potential problems, and three years since the SFO began its inquiry in earnest, the scale of the investigation has become apparent.

The Guardian has established the SFO team is now 30-strong, and is being supported by so-called “blockbuster funding” – money from the Treasury to cover exceptional costs.

“It soon became clear that it was multiple jurisdictions, across several strands of its business,” said a source with knowledge of the inquiry.

So what has happened in the past three years?

The SFO has given little away and has only confirmed making two arrests. They happened in February 2014, when it emerged that two businessmen Sudhir Choudhrie and his son Bhanu were questioned as part of its wide-ranging investigation into the activities of Rolls-Royce.

Neither has been charged and a few months after the arrests, the two men had their bail conditions lifted, but the Guardian understands the SFO’s inquiries are continuing.

The early focus on the Choudhries has been intriguing – their lawyers said they had not and have never been middlemen for Rolls-Royce, nor paid bribes to government officials or acted as middlemen in defence deals.

In short, they say they have done nothing wrong.

So who are they? The Choudhries are among the wealthiest and best-known families in India. They have a wide range of business interests and have become familiar faces in political circles in the UK too.

They are entrepreneurs and philanthropists, and have also been major donors to the Liberal Democrats. They and their extended families own a number of mansions in the heart of London’s Belgravia.

With such a high profile, they have not avoided scrutiny – or criticism.

In India, for instance, Sudhir Choudhrie was investigated in 2004 by India’s Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) – the country’s foremost law enforcement agency – over suspicions related to alleged payoffs to a company agent.

Years later the investigation was dropped, with Choudhrie insisting he had been a victim of a plot to damage his reputation. His lawyers told the Guardian: “Sudhir Choudhrie was investigated but was never arrested. He was subsequently cleared of all allegations of wrongdoing and the investigation as a whole was closed in 2011.”

In a closure report filed in a Delhi court that year, the CBI stated it did not find any evidence to suggest there was any payoff to Choudhrie or his companies.

A list compiled and disseminated by the CBI names Sudhir Choudhrie as one of 23 “unscrupulous persons” on a list of “undesirable contact men”. The list, which has been seen by the Guardian, is undated but is understood to still be in circulation in the Indian government. Choudhrie has challenged its authenticity. His lawyers say that although he has been made aware of it, he has no knowledge of its content and has never been contacted about it by any official body.

Separately from their alleged interaction with Rolls-Royce, there have been other occasions when the family’s finances have raised concerns.

One Swiss banking source has described to the Guardian and BBC how money transfers between the Choudhrie family group’s companies sparked an anti-money laundering alert at Clariden Leu, which was then a private banking division of Credit Suisse.

The Guardian has seen a report created by the risk management team at Clariden Leu in October 2008, which highlights the flow of vast sums that triggered the inquiry.

The report analysed 18 “account relationships” and looked at money transfers between companies owned or managed by members of Bhanu Choudhrie’s extended family. One was Belinea Services Limited, which received €37,200,000 (£33,400,000) from Rosoboronexport State Corporation, the Russian state’s arms dealership. Bhanu Choudhrie was a director of Belinea.

In the year leading up to the report, another company, the Seychelles-registered Cottage Consultants, received €28,100,000 from Rosoboronexport and transferred €22,700,000 to an Isle of Man bank.

On company documents, Bhanu Choudhrie is described as the “first and sole director” of Cottage Consultants. The company is owned through bearer shares, which means it is owned by whoever physically holds the share certificates. Bhanu Choudhrie has denied being a beneficial owner of the company.

Cottage Consultants had also received €9,700,000 from an entity called “ABC”, with the money originating from Vnesheconombank, a now-sanctioned Moscow bank.

The Guardian asked Bhanu Choudhrie about the transfers that had alerted Clariden Leu. His lawyers said he had no knowledge of the internal report and any suggestion that these payments were improper or illegal was false and defamatory.

The twists and turns of the Choudhries’ business empire have rarely been out of the news in recent years, but it is their apparent knowledge of the bureaucracy and red tape in their home country – and how best to navigate it – that might make them seem ideal middlemen for any company hoping to break into the lucrative Indian market. One such firm is alleged to have been Rolls-Royce.

The firm was involved in the the massive – and massively complicated – Hawk deal, which involved India buying Rolls-Royce engines and BAE-produced planes.

A first tranche of this was agreed in 2004, a second in 2010. The total value of all the contracts involved came to £2.1bn.

The parts were assembled at Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, an Indian state-owned aerospace and defence firm, where Sudhir Choudhrie’s uncle had been the chairman.

The Guardian has spoken to one Rolls-Royce source. The source said the Choudhries and their companies had worked with the firm during this period.

“You had to work your way and it took time,” said the Rolls-Royce source. “We needed to have Indian partners or a sister company in India.”

The source said local fixers would help arrange the deal, before senior Rolls-Royce figures arrived to complete it.

The Guardian and the BBC understand that millions of pounds of Rolls-Royce money went to the Choudhrie family.

Even if this were true, it does not mean there has been any wrongdoing. Using middlemen is not illegal, so long as they abide by the rules.

The Guardian asked the Choudhries to explain what role, if any, they – or their companies – had played in the Hawk deals. Lawyers for the Choudhries said they had not been middlemen or intermediaries and that any allegation that Rolls-Royce had paid them for the purpose of securing deals in India was untrue.

The Guardian has been told about a curious meeting between Bhanu Choudhrie and a British businessman.

It came from a banking source who spoke to the Guardian. The source alleged that Bhanu Choudhrie and a former BAE executive called Peter Ginger visited Geneva together in 2007. Ginger was BAE’s president in India until 2005.

The Guardian has been told that during this trip, Ginger allegedly deposited hundreds of thousands of pounds in cash into a Clariden Leu account from another account he held.

By 2009, the account, which was called No 120467 Portsmouth, held about 1m Swiss francs.

The Guardian has seen a copy of a bank document that shows the details of the Portsmouth account.

Separately, documents discovered among the Panama Papers – the investigation into the Mossack Fonseca law firm carried out by the Guardian, the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and Süddeutsche Zeitung – also reveal the family of Peter Ginger asking for a payment from an educational foundation with an apparent link to Bhanu Choudhrie.

An email seen by the Guardian shows the Panamanian foundation paid to cover the university costs of one of Ginger’s relatives. In one email, a member of the family requested money from the foundation to pay an allowance. “[…] is now back in [university ] for the summer term so we would be most grateful for payment to the same account as before,” he wrote.

He added: “I hope this is in order and meets with [the] foundation council’s approval. Please don’t hesitate to contact me or […] if you have any questions.”

The payment was for £540 for four weeks of “food and subsistence”.

We asked Ginger and Choudrie to explain these apparent interactions. Is there a benign explanation? Could the banking source in Geneva have got it wrong? Lawyers for Bhanu Choudhrie insist he has. “Our client has no knowledge of what bank accounts have been set up or operated by Mr Ginger or what sums (if any) he has deposited in them in cash. Mr Choudhrie did not pay any bribe to Mr Ginger.”

They added: “Our client has no knowledge of any payments made [by the Foundation].”

The Guardian asked Ginger why he visited Geneva with Bhanu Choudhrie, and why the Panamanian foundation was funding his relative’s education. He declined to comment on the allegations: “I am not prepared to talk about it at all. I’m not going to respond to the media at all.”

BAE Systems said it had “no record indicating that Mr Ginger had a personal financial relationship with Mr Choudhrie during the period that Mr Ginger was employed by the Company”.

The episode may be nothing more than an intriguing vignette, but the SFO may have an opportunity to judge for itself. The source, who asked not to be named, has offered to speak to the SFO’s investigators.

The Choudhries had to wait seven years to be cleared after Indian authorities launched an inquiry – the SFO has been looking at them, and at Rolls-Royce, for a mere three. And the investigation appears to be broadening even now.

Rolls-Royce plc, Britain’s leading manufacturing multinational, hired a network of agents to help it land lucrative contracts in at least 12 different countries around the world, sometimes allegedly using bribes.

An investigation by the Guardian and the BBC has uncovered leaked documents and testimony from insiders that suggest that Rolls-Royce may have benefited from the use of illicit payments to boost profits for years.

The network of agents is now the focus of large-scale investigations by anti-corruption agencies in the UK and the US.

The Guardian understands the inquiries are looking into specific allegations that these hired intermediaries were bribing people.

Rolls-Royce, which sells turbines and engines for passenger jets and military aircraft and is worth an estimated £13bn, declined to answer detailed questions.

A spokesman said: “Concerns about bribery and corruption involving intermediaries remain subject to investigation by the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) and other authorities. We are fully cooperating with the authorities and we cannot comment on ongoing investigations.”

The Guardian/BBC investigation, to be broadcast on the BBC’s Panorama programme on Monday, discloses that the use of agents by the blue-chip manufacturer is far wider than previously publicly known.

The agents have been hired in at least 12 countries – Brazil, India, China, Indonesia, South Africa, Angola, Iraq, Iran, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Nigeria and Saudi Arabia.

One individual who it is alleged has worked for Rolls-Royce is a businessman whose family has donated more than £1.6m to the Liberal Democrats and is currently an adviser to the party’s leader, Tim Farron.

Sudhir Choudhrie and his son, Bhanu, have been arrested and questioned by the SFO over the bribery allegations. Both denied wrongdoing and were released without charge.

The Guardian and the BBC understand that Choudhrie family companies were paid millions by Rolls-Royce.

Labour and Conservative administrations have forged close relations with Rolls-Royce and have often lobbied foreign governments to give large export contracts to the manufacturer.

David Cameron once praised it as “a world leader in the development of advanced technologies … of which the whole country can be proud”. The Duke of Cambridge called it “one of the United Kingdom’s great global companies”.

The investigation into Rolls is likely to concern ministers – a situation that has echoes of the controversy that enveloped the SFO’s inquiry into the arms manufacturer BAE Systems. In 2006, Tony Blair’s government pulled the plug on that inquiry, saying Britain’s security would be put in danger if it was allowed to continue.

The SFO’s entirely separate investigation into Rolls-Royce became public in 2012 when the firm announced that the agency had requested information about allegations of malpractice in Indonesia and China.

The following year, the SFO, backed by special funding from the Treasury, disclosed that its director, David Green, had opened a criminal investigation into allegations of bribery and corruption. It emerged in 2014 that the Department of Justice in the US had opened its own inquiry.

A legal source said 30 investigators in the UK were now focused on the multinational’s use of agents, or middlemen, to clinch export contracts in a number of countries across several strands of its business.

Part of the SFO investigation is likely to centre on Rolls-Royce’s relationship with Unaoil, a Monaco-based firm that has been accused of using bribes to win contracts in a series of countries for dozens of multinationals.

This year, the SFO opened a criminal investigation into Unaoil over allegations of bribery, corruption and money laundering. Leaked documents, obtained by Fairfax Media in Australia, suggest Rolls-Royce hired Unaoil to seal contracts in Iraq, Iran, Kazakhstan, Angola and Azerbaijan.

Unaoil said it was not “involved in corrupt practices relating to its business relationship with Rolls-Royce”. It said that some of the information that formed the basis of the allegations against it “has been gathered as a result of criminal activity including extortion”.

Another agent hired by Rolls-Royce is Fana Hlongwane, who is close to South Africa’s ANC government and in 2008 was implicated in a separate corruption scandal.

A confidential contract shows that in 2005, Rolls-Royce signed up Hlongwane as a commercial consultant to promote its business in South Africa. Hlongwane has previously denied that he or his companies have been involved in any corruption or wrongdoing. He has not been prosecuted for any offences and did not respond to a request for comment.

Anti-corruption experts say that firms can use well-connected agents to channel bribes to key politicians or officials who are responsible for awarding contracts, although there are many different legitimate uses for agents in foreign countries.



Rolls-Royce has said that since the bribery allegations began to surface, it has dramatically culled the number of agents it uses, although it has not specified how many. Admitting in its annual report two years ago that the allegations were a “body blow”, Rolls-Royce has said its employees now have more direct responsibility for selling its products.

In a statement, Rolls-Royce plc said: “We have made it clear that Rolls-Royce will not tolerate business misconduct or inappropriate behaviour of any kind and in recent years we have intensified our focus on ethics and compliance, which are foundations of our culture.”

“Our global code of conduct, which applies to all of our employees, makes it clear that we have zero tolerance to bribery and corruption.

“In 2014, our anti-bribery and corruption compliance team, working with internationally respected independent authority on ethics and compliance Lord Gold, completed a thorough review and update of the group’s anti-bribery and corruption policies including those concerning the use of advisers and intermediaries.”

The SFO said it “is conducting major investigations into allegations of bribery and corruption involving both Rolls-Royce and Unaoil. We cannot comment further at this time.”

No convictions have been overturned in the first test appeals under a new interpretation of “joint enterprise” laws, dashing the hopes of those who claim they are victims of a widespread miscarriage of justice.

The decisions handed down by the criminal court of appeal on Monday will disappoint hundreds of imprisoned young people who had been considering bringing similar challenges.

Their hopes had been bolstered by a supreme court victory in February, which declared that judges had been misinterpreting the “foresight principle” in joint enterprise cases for 30 years.

The panel of appeal court judges, led by the lord chief justice, Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd, examined the cases of 13 men affected by the principle, technically known as “parasitic accessorial liability”.

The court focused on the facts of each individual case to test whether the defendants – who were mostly young and from black or minority ethnic backgrounds – should have been convicted.

But in none of them did it deem the convictions to be unsafe. Delivering the judgment in one of the main cases, the judges said: “Given the jury’s findings of fact, their verdicts would have been no different [in the light of the supreme court ruling]. We refuse leave as we are satisfied that there was no injustice, let alone substantial injustice.” They made similar observations in the other cases.

The decisions were greeted by shouts of “Shame on the court” and “No justice, no peace” by campaigners who gathered to hear the judgment.

Gloria Morrison, one of the organisers of Joint Enterprise Not Guilty By Association, said: “They have given us nothing.”

Deb Madden, also of Jengba, said: “We are going to go back to the supreme court. It’s wrong to put someone into prison for something that someone else did.”

The campaigners had been hopeful that the case of Michael Hall would help write a new interpretation of the law. 



Hall, then 22, an electrician, had been with his girlfriend, Laura Mitchell, also 22, outside a Bradford pub in January 2007 when a fight broke out over who had booked a taxi. 



During the initial scuffle, Hall said, he pulled the eventual victim, Andrew Ayres, 50, off Mitchell. She was later seen wandering around the car park; she said she was simply trying to find shoes, which had been lost.

Both Hall and Mitchell, who has a young son, insisted they were unaware that two of their co-defendants had allegedly gone to a nearby house, armed themselves with CS spray, knuckledusters and ball and chain mace and returned for a more serious fight.

But in relation to Hall, the three court of appeal judges concluded that his lawyers would have to demonstrate that a “substantial injustice” had occurred.

The judges said: “It is plain on the facts that [Hall] would have been convicted of manslaughter had he not been convicted of murder ... In our view, the jury must have concluded on the evidence before them that Hall was in the second phase of the incident, a party to the common purpose of inflicting unlawful violence on the group.”

In the February assessment, Lord Neuberger, the president of the supreme court, said that a line of legal reasoning introduced in 1984 had been an error. Foresight of what someone else might do was merely part of the evidence, he said. “It is for the jury to decide on the whole evidence whether [a secondary party] had the necessary intent.”

The law of joint enterprise, also known as “common purpose”, operates where someone acts in conjunction with the killer but does not strike the blow that causes death. It makes them equally liable for the killing.

Under the old foresight rule, someone could be convicted of a crime committed by an associate if it was judged that they had foreseen the accomplice might commit it.

Joint enterprise law dates back to at least the 16th century. It was later developed to deter duelling by making seconds and doctors liable for murder.

Many of those jailed under joint enterprise rules for secondary roles in crimes have been handed extremely long sentences because judges’ ability to exercise discretion in individual cases was curtailed by the imposition of mandatory life tariffs for murder under the 2003 Criminal Justice Act.

Commenting on the appeal court ruling on joint enterprise, Alison Levitt QC, the former principal legal adviser to the director of public prosecutions and a partner at the law firm Mishcon de Reya, said: “The law, even as clarified by [by the supreme court], still leaves substantial room for concern about the position of those who, whilst guilty of murder as a matter of law, in reality played a lesser role.

“Although this will not help those already convicted, perhaps this is now the time for parliament to give consideration to whether the offence of murder should now be divided into first and second degree murder.”

Suzanne Gower, managing director of the Centre for Criminal Appeals, said: “The court of appeal’s disappointing judgment will make it even harder for individuals and families whose lives have been ruined by a faulty, now-discredited interpretation of the law to achieve justice.

“Put simply, today’s ruling combined with our declining appeals system will prevent injustices from being corrected.”

My blog posting last week, Press freedom danger if MPs vote in section 40 by the back door, was damned by members and supporters of Hacked Off.

Brian Cathcart called it humbug. Steven Barnett described it as a fundamental misreading of the situation. Tim Fenton accused me of selling the pass. There were Twitter nods of agreement from Evan Harris and Máire Davies, among several others.

It was tough to be accused of siding with the media establishment after 24 years of doing the opposite. During that time I have supported many, many “ordinary people who have been lied about and intruded upon by national newspapers”.

But that doesn’t mean that I have to accept Hacked Off’s remedy - a form of press regulation established by a royal charter - as the best cure.

I concede that I initially thought the charter was a clever way to underpin regulation (although I was disappointed at the clumsy way it came about). I changed my mind when I realised the implications

I know Hacked Off, which represents victims of press misbehaviour, sincerely thinks it has found the best possible way to stop abuses by newspapers while maintaining press freedom.

In so doing, its ideologues have placed their faith in the political establishment. They believe the charter is safe in the hands of MPs and peers and that the conditions that might lead to it being altered are highly unlikely.

But my lack of respect for what they call the media establishment (which, incidentally, is itself a mythical construct) is nothing like as great as my lack of respect for the so-called political establishment.

Given an opportunity during one those not infrequent febrile clashes between parliament and the press, politicians could conceivably vary the terms of the charter. Even if this sounds far-fetched, because of the numbers necessary to bring it about, it is possible. So why take the risk?

Does the BBC feel safe from political interference because it has a royal charter? Parliamentary control of the corporation’s budget has had the effect of reducing editorial staff and thereby reducing news coverage.

And while I’m on that point, did anyone notice how the BBC failed to cover the Guardian’s story about the Theresa May/Goldman Sachs tapes? Was that a caution born of its concern about not rocking the government boat?

Under the charter, a press regulator must secure official recognition by satisfying 29 conditions. They are not unduly onerous. One of them, which I welcome, is the creation of a low-cost arbitration arm.

This has two benefits: it would allow people without the necessary funds to sue newspapers to have their legal complaints heard; it would be cheaper also for well-heeled complainants (and, of course, newspaper publishers).

But here is the rub. Any publisher not regulated by an approved regulator - even if it were to set up an arbitration service - would find itself subject to a provision of the courts and crime act 2013, known as section 40.



This would compel publishers to pay the legal costs, win or lose, for both itself and the complainant.



Can anyone be surprised that publishers are up in arms at that possibility? The government, having realised the implications after intense lobbing by publishers, has yet to trigger section 40, but it’s on the statute book and could be introduced at any time.

Whether you see this as a carrot to lure publishers into an approved regulator or a stick to compel them to do so, it is a form of blackmail and, by extension, inimical to freedom of expression.

Why? Because it is conceivable that a publisher outside the system, such as the Guardian or Private Eye, could face crippling legal costs.

You may feel unsympathetic towards wealthy publishers - although they are thinner on the ground, and certainly less profitable, than was once the case - but the iniquity of them funding litigants is obvious.

Most of my critics have taken issue with my imagining a scenario in which section 40 opens the door to injustice.

I argued that people could sue over, say, a case of phone-hacking and reverse the burden of proof by requiring a newspaper to prove a negative (ie, that it hadn’t done so).

Such a claim, it was suggested, would be thrown out by a judge because people would have to produce concrete evidence.

I am not so sure, having watched certain lawyers over the years play fast and loose with defamation claims (and also privacy claims). While we’re on the subject of establishments, let no-one underestimate the legal establishment’s capability to use a bad law to its fullest extent... and beyond.

Not being sure is the problem here. We are facing the possibility of a calamity, and all because, back in those frenetic post-Leveson report days, there was a failure to agree a proper settlement that would have drawn both sides, victims and villains, together.

I’m with you, Brian, Steven, Tim, Evan and Máire on the need to ensure our press behaves itself, but not at the cost of allowing an arcane instrument of state to threaten press freedom.

A man has been jailed for more than 19 years for the 1998 murder of waiter Surjit Singh Chhokar in a retrial under double jeopardy laws.

Ronnie Coulter was found guilty at the high court in Glasgow earlier this month of stabbing the 32-year-old almost 18 years ago.

The attack happened as Chhokar returned from his work at an Indian restaurant in Wishaw, North Lanarkshire, on 4 November 1998.

Coulter, 48, was previously acquitted when he stood trial in 1999 for the murder but was convicted by a majority when the case became only the second to return to court since Scotland’s centuries-old double jeopardy law was reformed in 2011.

He was sentenced to life at the same court on Monday, with a minimum term of 19 years and eight months.

Judge Lord Matthews said Chhokar was the “victim of an ambush that cost him his life”. 



In passing sentence, he said the violent attack was not “spur of the moment” but had been discussed by Coulter earlier in the day. He praised the patience and “quiet dignity of the Chhokar family”.

Matthews said: “It is plain that the only purpose was violence. You inflicted three stab wounds in what was a despicable and cowardly act.”

In mitigation, Coulter’s representative Donald Findlay QC said his client maintains that he was at the scene but did not “wield the knife”. He also said race “had no part whatsoever to play in this matter” and urged Matthews to judge on the facts of the case and exercise leniency in respect of Coulter’s treatment for depression and paranoid schizophrenia.

Turkish authorities have shut down 15 media outlets, including one of the world’s only women’s news agencies, and detained the editor-in-chief of an opposition newspaper, in the latest crackdown since a coup attempt in July.

The Cumhuriyet editor-in-chief, Murat Sabuncu, and other executives from the paper were detained in raids early on Monday morning on accusations that they committed crimes on behalf of Kurdish militants and a network linked to the US-based cleric Fethullah Gülen, the Istanbul prosecutor’s office said.

Gülen is blamed by the Turkish government for the attempted putsch.

An emergency decree issued late on Saturday ordered the shutdown of 10 newspapers, two news agencies and three magazines. Most of the media organisations that were closed had head offices in the predominantly Kurdish south-east. A further 10,000 civil servants have also been sacked.

The decree brought the total number of media outlets closed since July to more than 160.

“The police came around 4am on Sunday morning and sealed the office,” said Beritan Canözer, a journalist in Diyarbakır for Jinha, the news agency staffed entirely by women. “We have not received a court order. There have not been any official justifications for this measure. Nobody explained anything to us.”

Canözer, who was detained last December while reporting on a demonstration in Diyarbakır because police decided she looked “too excited”, underlined that the shutdown would not spell the end to Jinha’s work. “We will find other ways to inform the public,” she said. “We will continue to report … They cannot silence us.”

Rights groups have harshly criticised the recent crackdown on press freedom in Turkey.

According to independent media platform P24, 99 journalists have been formally arrested since the botched military intervention, turning Turkey once again into the world’s leading jailor of reporters. Thousands of journalists have lost their jobs. Hundreds of government-issued press accreditations have been cancelled, and an unknown number of journalists had their passports revoked, thus banning them from all foreign travel.

Almost 2,000 academics and teachers were also among those sacked via the emergency decrees, many of whom were members of the leftist teachers’ union Eğitim-Sen.

A state of emergency, announced on 20 July, has recently been extended for another three months until January. The measure allows President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and the AKP cabinet to bypass parliament, rule via decree, and suspend rights and freedoms as they deem necessary.

According to state-run news agency Anadolu, more than 37,000 people were formally arrested. Around 100,000 more civil servants were fired or suspended during recent purges.

The Catholic church could face a compensation bill of millions of pounds following a test case on sexual abuse at a former children’s home which opens on Monday.

The civil case at the high court in Leeds follows the imprisonment this year of the home’s former principal and chaplain for sexual offences against 11 boys between 1970 and 1991.



Five survivors have brought a civil claim against the Catholic diocese of Middlesbrough and the De La Salle brotherhood, whose members ran St William’s Home in Market Weighton in east Yorkshire.



In total, 249 people have alleged that they were sexually and physically abused by staff at the home. If the civil case is successful, the Catholic church in the UK could face one of the biggest payouts in its history.



In January, James Carragher, the former principal, was jailed for 15 years for 21 indecent assaults and three serious sex offences, but was cleared of a further 30 charges. It was the third time he had been sent to prison for sexually abusing boys at the home.



Anthony MacCallen, the former chaplain, was convicted of 11 charges, including a serious sexual offence. He was acquitted of eight others.



In sentencing the men, Judge Geoffrey Marson QC said the survivors had suffered “severe long-term, continuing psychological harm as a result of what you did”.



The residential school, which was owned by the diocese of Middlesbrough and was run by members of the De La Salle brotherhood, took boys from troubled backgrounds referred by local authorities. It closed in 1992. 



A civil action was launched in 2004, but was delayed by a dispute between the diocese and brotherhood over which was liable for an £8m compensation claim. In 2012, the supreme court ruled that both were liable.



One survivor, Nigel Feeley, told the BBC he had lived through a nightmare. “He had the power. You couldn’t get away from it. You had to live the nightmare… You couldn’t scream at him and say go away, get off me, because he had the power.”



David Greenwood of Switalskis solicitors who has represented survivors since 2003, said: “It is hoped that this trial will bring a positive conclusion to the cases for the many deserving victims of abuse at St William’s. There is no doubt that widespread sexual abuse of boys was taking place at St William’s. There have been many convictions, in 1993, 2004 and 2015. This case is a test for our civil justice system. I hope it will be able to provide real justice.”

Neither the diocese of Middlesbrough nor the De La Salle brotherhood could be reached for comment, but both have previously issued statements condemning abuse.



The case is expected to last three weeks.

The GMB union has accused Uber of misleading its drivers by claiming last week’s tribunal decision on working conditions only affects two drivers involved in the case.

In a long-awaited judgment, an employment tribunal agreed with two drivers for the ride-hailing app that Uber’s drivers were not self-employed and should receive the “national living wage”, annual leave and other benefits. Uber has said it will appeal against the judgment.

James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam brought the case on behalf of a group 19 Uber workers who argued they were employed by the San Francisco-based company and not working for themselves. Lawyers said the victory would affect their fellow Uber drivers and have implications for tens of thousands of workers in the so-called gig economy.

But the GMB said Uber sent an email to its 40,000 drivers on Friday, signed by its regional general manager for northern Europe, Jo Bertram, who was criticised by the tribunal judges for using “twisted language” and for being “grimly loyal” to her company.

Bertram’s email to the drivers said: “As you may be aware, earlier this year a small number of London partner-drivers brought a claim to challenge their self-employed status with Uber. Although we have today heard that this challenge has been successful at this first stage, it’s very important to note that today’s decision only affects two individuals and Uber will be appealing it.

“There will be no change to your partnership with Uber in light of this decision and we will continue to support the overwhelming majority of drivers who tell us that they use the Uber app to be their own boss and choose when and where to drive.”

The tribunal judges dismissed Uber’s claim that its London operation was a mosaic of thousands of small businesses linked by a technology platform as “faintly ridiculous”. They said Uber resorted to “fictions, twisted language and even brand new terminology” to portray their drivers as self-employed.

In their judgment, the tribunal judges singled out Bertram for criticism and quoted from Shakespeare’s Hamlet to cast doubt on her testimony.

“Ms Bertram spoke of Uber assisting the drivers to ‘grow’ their businesses, but no driver is in a position to do anything of the kind, unless growing his business simply means spending more hours at the wheel. Reflecting on the case, and on the grimly loyal evidence of Ms Bertram in particular, we cannot help being reminded of Queen Gertrude’s most celebrated line: ‘The lady doth protest too much, methinks.’”



Maria Ludkin, GMB’s legal director, said: “Even after the judge found Ms Bertram’s evidence lacked credibility and described her as ‘grimly loyal’, she continues to try and advance a misleading and false set of facts. The Uber judgment applies to 40,000 UK drivers, not two. Ms Bertram might be wise to think how this judgment reflects on her before she issues any more statements.”

Uber will take the case to the employment appeal tribunal, and following its decision there could be further hearings in the court of appeal and then the supreme court. Any payments due to drivers will not be calculated until that process is over.

Other drivers with the firm will not automatically receive payouts but, if the company accepts the ruling, it will have to change its contracts to avoid more cases being brought by drivers. Lawyers say that Uber’s terms and conditions are similar for all of its UK operatives.

GMB also rejected Uber’s claim that its drivers earned an average £16 an hour and that most wanted to keep the flexibility their current contracts provide.

Ludkin said: “This judgment in no way affects driver flexibility, it merely guarantees them basic employment rights. Uber’s decision to appeal that is purely related to protecting their ample profits and nothing to do with protecting the drivers.”



Meanwhile other cases are likely to follow the Uber judgment. Cycle couriers are making similar claims against firms including CitySprint, Addison Lee, eCourier and Excel. Law firms are also talking to workers at Deliveroo, which delivers meals by cycle and motorbike.

An Uber spokesman said: “The ruling would affect the two drivers that were the test cases in the tribunal. However, while we appeal this judgement drivers that use the Uber app remain independent and able to choose when and where they drive.”

Ready, steady, woe! Remember Lord Justice Leveson’s overarching theme in that hallowed press regulation report of his? “A new system must be effective, and one of the key criteria of effectiveness is that it should include all major publishers of news (if not all publishers of newspapers and magazines).” He wanted “a single regulatory body that could establish a single set of standards on which the public can rely”. Well, good luck with that …

Before Leveson, there was the now derided Press Complaints Commission (PCC) – with Richard Desmond’s Express group and Private Eye sitting outside the tent.

After Leveson, we have the new Independent Press Standards Organisation (Ipso), with 1,500 newspapers and magazines, plus 1,100 attendant websites, in its portfolio. We have the Guardian, Observer, i, Evening Standard and FT outside, doing their own regulatory thing, with in-house codes attached.

And now we have Impress, sanctified as pure and compliant by the government-funded Press Recognition Panel last week. Impress has a few dozen hyperlocal papers and blogs on its roster – but nothing you could remotely describe as a “major publisher”.

Whatever happened to that booming mantra about “a new system that must include everyone”? It’s toast, alas. Burned toast. But is it enough to echo Brian Leveson’s verdict that failure to come together must be “a sad indictment of the inability of the press to put commercial interest to one side”? The passing years have made that seem a tad naive.

Those who formed Ipso (apart from funding its operation) did so knowing that HMG seemed committed to activating section 40 of the Crime and Courts Act 2013 so that once a “recognised regulator” took to the stage, as Impress has now done, publishers faced paying the crippling costs of libel actions even if they won the case. And they didn’t trust Westminster or Whitehall involvement in the final royal charter version of life with Brian, one cooked up with Hacked Off and takeaway pizzas over a long night in the Cabinet Office.

Those who stand outside Ipso – the Observer and the rest – have their own reasons, but remember the verdict of the Guardian’s last editor: this whole royal charter package is a “medieval nonsense”. Alan Rusbridger, after the baying pursuit of Edward Snowden and his revelations, feared that the “safeguards” against charter change – a vote of two-thirds of the Commons – offered no safety at all. (See this month how riptides of public opinion drive Commons’ voting, Sir Shifty.) And, like the FT, Rusbridger knew that the regulation of web coverage spanning the globe from a small Impress office in London Victoria was nonsense squared. The world, the real world, was moving on. Fast.

There are indictments to this story at every turn. Some of them can be delivered to selected newspaper front doors in the wake of the phone-hacking and Mazher Mahmood trials. Nobody’s arguing with that, or with the millions in legal retribution that follow. But don’t let other key players off scot free. The police had, and still have, a lot to answer for – especially after their single Operation Elveden “success” went Bun-shaped last week.

But frailty is there on all sides. Brian Leveson didn’t understand the first thing about the internet; and that shows. The politicians didn’t embrace his words as holy writ, either. He wanted Ofcom to do the recognition panel act, putting it in charge of all broadcasting, including the BBC; all telecommunications, including sawing Vodafone off at the knees; and all newspapers and their news websites.

That was a botch, one compounded as No 10 and parliament got involved in cross-party stitch-ups. Hacked Off, blazing vitriolically away, didn’t help one jot. And we need to acknowledge, here, now, where this wandering, rutted track has led us.

David Cameron is history. So is the compromise that Oliver Letwin patched together one long night in 2013. Mr Letwin is a humble backbencher who buys his own pizzas these days. Brian Leveson is busy elsewhere, president of the Queen’s bench division. And the royal charter that occupies most current thought is the one foisted on the BBC in the name of “independent” broadcasting. If anyone had written four years ago that the tainted fruit of this inquiry would be a “recognised regulator” funded almost entirely by Max Mosley, hollow laughs would have turned to guffaws.

And the problem is that it isn’t all over yet. Just the reverse. Karen Bradley, our newish culture secretary in loco Theresa, isn’t minded to activate section 40 just yet. But she might if there’s another outcry over some egregious shock-horror reporting – or, worse, a repeat of the national security revels that dogged Snowden coverage. She, and those who follow her, can choose. Our government, if it so wishes, has a lock-hold on the press, a way of turning free to corralled by fiat.

That’s no happy solution. Nor for an Impress pottering along until Mr Mosley’s beneficence runs dry, its mere existence, in one stalwart’s words, just enough to “keep Ipso honest”. Nor is there anything particularly joyful about the £3m of government money provided to sustain the tiny Press Recognition Panel until patience and prospects run out at the end of next year.

None of this is a victory for one side or the other. Everything about it portends more stalemate to come. Which ought, at last, to mean a little fresh thinking. Ipso, if you look hard at the detail, has made a pretty good stab at improving voluntary regulation. Set the Ipso and Impress editorial codes side by side and no one can see much difference. Apply those codes to current cases and there’s no obvious gap either. The problem for Ipso isn’t performance but perception, as Sir Joseph Pilling, former permanent secretary for Northern Ireland and chairman of the report on human sexuality for the House of Bishops, wrote the other day in his external review of Ipso’s first two years.

“[It] is an uphill task for Ipso to prove that it deserves to be trusted as independent regulator. Decisions made by those in charge of the PCC led to its demise and a collapse in public trust. This is only compounded by the fact that Ipso is funded, and was established, by the industry. In these circumstances, it is no easy task to gain the public’s trust.”

In short, no matter how stringently a former judge such as Sir Alan Moses and his Ipso team perform their regulatory duties, they’re still there to be sniped at – in principle as well as in practice.

But are such perceptions set in stone? Could there be movement on this central point, the possibility of Ipso collecting its money direct from those it regulates (with an independent finance interlocutor on hand to ensure fair play)? If there is, many objections – including some of those of current outsiders – drop away. Impress could also ask itself searching questions. Are we a help or a hindrance to things we believe in? Have we any real future, apart from lingering while more Max money is spent? Recognition gives us a little clout, but no decisive power.

It’s a mistake to think of Impress as some jerry-built Trojan horse. Jonathan Heawood, its founder and driver, is a human rights campaigner of note. He didn’t set out to start a front organisation. He doesn’t need and shouldn’t want to spend months and unproductive years playing prime spoiler on the Fleet Street block. There ought to be room for beneficial rapprochement here. Both sides, for instance, are bent on providing an arbitration service. Ipso is exploring possibilities with a professional arbitrator. Room for co-operation and comparison.

Maybe Mosley wouldn’t want a peace treaty. Maybe – nay, certainly – Hacked Off will keep banging away as though it were 2007 all over again. But hyperbole and hysteria from the trenches are wearing out their welcome. And MPs, too, have a moment for pause. They can plough forward with their own riffs on Leveson, as the House of Lords did recently when it overturned government whips and passed an amendment to the investigatory powers bill, proposed by Baroness Hollins, that allows people suing a newspaper over phone-hacking to claim their costs of their action from the publisher in question: section 40’s little brother.

More Murdoch bashing! Jolly good show! But the effect of the amendment means that a claimant could come to any publisher and state that they believe the only way that it could have sourced a story was by hacking their phone. The publisher – any publisher, no Murdoch limitation here – would have to make a nightmare decision: do you reveal the source of your story, or make clear that you have a source but will not reveal them at all costs?

The Hollins amendment – if upheld when the Common votes on it in a few days – means that claimants will be able to use the clause to force journalists to prove a negative, and then pay the costs of the claimant for having done so. Which, inevitably, means less protection for sources, Observer or Sun (whatever the Impress code says about protecting them).

It’s the old game of unintended consequences. It also shows the peril of piecemeal tinkering on freedom’s turf. And the alternative for our legislators seems ever clearer, and more necessary. They could stand back and mothball section 40 while negotiating space develops. They could – very sensibly – encourage a dramatically revamped regulatory regime that fits the internet age. They could also seek a fresh, more collegiate start.

For let’s be clear where Impress recognition left us last week. Stuck with stereotypes and delusions. Believing that a “free press” can be inflicted by political blackmail, or law. Arguing that the great and good regulatory classes – legal eagles, NHS administrators, media academics, charity directors and professional regulators of anything going – are somehow the voice of Britain in this age of non-metropolitan disenchantment. All of them and all of us up a blind alley, promising only more of the same.

It doesn’t make sense any longer. Blanket bitterness stuck in a time warp. Most editors, like most politicians with a soupçon of perspective, would know what to say about such impasses. Time to dismantle the barricades. Time to move on.

A couple who have been living together for the past six years will this week demand the right to a civil partnership, arguing that they face discrimination under the present law, which gives gay couples the option of marriage or a civil partnership but denies the latter to heterosexual couples.

Earlier this year the high court ruled against a legal challenge to the Civil Partnership Act 2004 by Rebecca Steinfeld and Charles Keidan. On Wednesday their appeal against that ruling will be heard in the high court, with judgment expected to be reserved. The couple say they are prepared to take their case to the supreme court and the European Court of Human Rights if necessary.

“A civil partnership would reflect who we are,” Keidan told the Observer. “It’s a modern social contract that doesn’t have the associations of marriage but would give the protection that we and other cohabiting couples crave.”

The act states that civil partnerships that provide legal rights and obligations to couples regarding children, property and pensions would be available to “two people of the same sex”. It was passed in 2004 in response to demands from gay rights campaigners for legal recognition for unions between same-sex couples. Then in 2013 same-sex marriage was legalised, giving gay couples the option of marriage or a civil partnership. The latter continues to be denied to heterosexual couples.

There are almost three million opposite sex couples living together in the UK, and almost four in 10 have dependent children, according to the Equal Civil Partnerships campaign. Although many people believe that people in “common law marriages” have rights over children and property protection, there is no such provision in law. “The fastest growing families in the UK are people who choose not to get married,” said Keidan, who has a 17-month-old daughter, Eden, with Steinfeld. “It would be a really straightforward thing for the government to extend civil partnerships to couples like us.”

Steinfeld added: “For many people, marriage is a very meaningful way to express their love. But there are also many reasons why people don’t want to get married. It’s not for the government to dictate, but to ensure that couples are legally protected.”

The couple have made wills, but will not have automatic rights to pensions or couples’ inheritance tax allowances. Their legal battle has been funded by their own savings, donations from philanthropic organisations and crowdfunding which raised £35,000. They are being represented in the court of appeal by lawyers acting on a pro bono basis.

At the high court hearing in January, the government argued that changing legislation would be “costly and complex”, and that following same-sex marriage legislation, civil partnerships may be phased out or abolished in the future. Following the ruling, a government spokesperson said that the “current regime of marriage and civil partnership does not disadvantage opposite sex couples”.

Steinfeld said it was untenable for the government to maintain the “unfair status quo”. The arguments regarding costs were shortsighted, she added. “The costs of changing the law pale into insignificance compared to the costs of dealing with the consequences of relationship breakdown where there is no legal protection.”

She and Keidan said there was growing support for a change in the law. More than 70,000 people have signed an online petition, and Conservative MP Tim Loughton has introduced a private member’s bill in parliament.

The only place in the British Isles where civil partnerships are available to different sex couples is the Isle of Man. After homosexuality was decriminalised on the island in the 1990s, a new law came into force earlier this year permitting marriage and civil partnerships to all couples.

Adeline Cosson and Kieran Hodgson became the first opposite-sex couple in the UK to enter into a civil partnership earlier this month, swiftly followed by Claire Beale and Martin Loat, who travelled from London for their ceremony. The Isle of Man is a crown dependency, but not part of the UK.After the new law was passed, Peter Tatchell, a campaigner for marriage equality, said: “Their new legislation is even more progressive than the UK. Instead of segregated marriage laws for gay and straight couples, they have a single civil marriage law that applies to everyone regardless of sexual orientation.

“The Isle of Man has also opened up civil partnerships to opposite-sex couples; in contrast to the ban that exists in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. These changes catapult the Isle of Man to the forefront of legal equality for straight and gay couples.”

The League Against Cruel Sports’ decision to offer rewards of up to £5,000 for information leading to the prosecution of people involved in dog fighting has been attacked by its former chairman who says it will reward criminals.

Having piloted the scheme in Bedfordshire, the league is rolling the scheme out in Birmingham as part of a strategy to collect intelligence on the underground “sport” that anecdotal evidence suggests is on the increase. By building up a picture, it hopes to persuade MPs of the need to tighten the law on dog fighting.

Prosecutions, currently under the Animal Welfare Act 2006, carry a maximum penalty of 51 weeks in jail. The charity says that despite being banned almost 200 years ago, a dog fight takes place every day of the year in the UK as the “sport” moves into urban areas where criminal gangs bet on the fights.

But John Cooper, QC, who chaired the league between 1996 and 2012 and was then its president until last year, has criticised the decision. “Dog fighters may be criminals who engage in a host of peripheral criminal activities, including violence, drug dealing and gang-related intimidation,” Cooper said. “The clandestine culture of dog fighting and its nexus with other crimes makes it highly likely that those who can give significant evidence, which will lead to conviction, will be involved in the criminal world. It is extremely inappropriate for charitable money to be paid to such individuals, who will, without doubt, use that money to further their own criminal purpose.”

In a statement to the Observer, the league said any rewards would be appropriately risk-assessed in line with its charitable objectives. “Offering rewards for information is a tactic not out of keeping with recognised professional practices and one the charity has used in previous years to glean information relating to illegal hunting and dog fighting, including while John Cooper was president,” it said.

It pointed out that rewards are regularly employed by the police and Crimestoppers. “It is a proven method used to encourage reporting from all strands of society. It has also been thought to serve as a deterrent, as criminals may feel at more risk of exposure. It is incorrect to assume that everyone who provides information relating to a criminal act will be a criminal, as any experienced barrister such as John Cooper or any judge who has heard an ex-parte application in relation to the use of informant information should be acutely aware.”

A report by the league published last year suggested that some organised dog fights can last for up to five hours. The dogs’ owners often take the animal out of town to seek medical attention or use DIY kits sold over the internet to avoid alerting authorities.

It also found that prohibited dogs were being bred and sold for substantial sums of money. Some were subject to brutal training techniques including body or head slamming. There was evidence that pet cats and dogs were being stolen to be used as live training’ bait’.

Cooper, who said he was not entitled to attend trust meetings as president and therefore had no idea the league had offered such incentives, warned the measure could backfire. “As a criminal barrister and QC of more than 30 years standing, it is known practice for rival criminal gangs to inform upon each other, with the sole purpose of putting their rivals out of business,” he said. “By offering a financial inducement to them to do so simply funds the next dog fighting ring and surely is an inappropriate use of charitable funds.”

People from former mining areas may never trust the police again unless the home secretary, Amber Rudd, announces a full Hillsborough-style investigation into allegations of police brutality at Orgreave in 1984, one of those caught up in the violence has warned.

Writing in the Observer, former miner Kevin Horne describes how he was arrested on 18 June 1984, along with other men “bleeding from broken limbs, cracked skulls and [others] bandaging their own wounds with T-shirts”. Even after charges against him were dropped, Horne says the damage endured. “My family became infected with what I have called a disease – a distrust of the police that spans generations. But this week, the government has the opportunity to turn the page on these years.”

Rudd is expected to lay out her plans for an inquiry, to be led by a single judge, into one of the most notorious events in the miners’ strike, when about 6,000 police clashed with pickets in the South Yorkshire coalfield. A total of 95 miners were charged following the confrontation at the plant south of Rotherham. Evidence later emerged that South Yorkshire police deliberately fabricated evidence and exaggerated the cases against the pickets.

The so-called Battle of Orgreave became a defining moment in the miners’ strike and in the arguments that raged between those in mining communities who were fighting for their livelihoods and the authorities working for the Thatcher government.

Demands for a wide-ranging investigation have grown since officers in the same South Yorkshire force of the 1980s were left discredited earlier this year by the inquests into the people who died in the 1989 Hillsborough football disaster, which followed a 27-year fight by the families for justice.

Now those seeking justice over Orgreave, who are backed by many Hillsborough campaigners, fear Rudd will merely announce a limited inquiry of the kind led by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith that was first established into the deaths of the 96 Liverpool fans a decade after the event. That inquiry failed to establish the truth about police behaviour and culpability and would be “completely unacceptable”, say the campaigners.

Horne says: “Former miners and our families fear that an inquiry sitting behind closed doors, led by a single establishment figure, will not get to the truth. If she chooses a scaled-down approach, the home secretary will make the same mistake that left the Hillsborough families fighting for an extra decade.”

Barbara Jackson, secretary of the Orgreave Truth and Justice Campaign, said that what was needed was a full investigation involving an independent panel of experts who could look at all the evidence, similar to that set up in 2012, following years of pressure into the Hillsborough disaster.

“We trust that Amber Rudd will announce the only right decision, namely that there must be an inquiry into what happened at Orgreave and after it. These events are too serious to let them lie. However, we have real concerns about what sort of inquiry the home secretary will establish: history is littered with examples of inquiries that have disappointed, such as the ‘establishment-led’ Stuart-Smith scrutiny into Hillsborough, which completely failed to get to the truth.

“We are keen to ensure that the home secretary does not make similar mistakes over Orgreave.”

Margaret Aspinall, chair of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, said the fight for an appropriate inquiry would go on if Rudd announced a scaled-down investigation. “There are suggestions that the home secretary will offer the Orgreave campaigners a judicial inquiry similar to the one set up in 1998 into the disaster at Hillsborough. This, in our view, would be completely unacceptable as history shows in our case it only served to lengthen the cover-up.”

Former Labour cabinet minister Andy Burnham played a leading role in forging the 2012 Hillsborough investigation, setting in train events that led to the inquest verdicts of accidental death being overturned in favour of a judgment that the 96 Liverpool fans were “unlawfully killed”. He said: “I have nothing but praise for the way Theresa May handled Hillsborough, but all politicians must be prepared to go wherever the evidence trail takes us. After Hillsborough, that trail led very directly to Orgreave.

“The case for an inquiry is overwhelming and undeniable. In recent weeks, new evidence has emerged about excessive violence on the day itself and mass manufacture of police statements. Unless these allegations are properly investigated, it will damage trust in the government and the police.

“Theresa May came to office promising to heal divides and she must now show that those words have real meaning.”

Suicides in prison have reached “epidemic” proportions, with rates of self-harm and violence soaring to unprecedented levels. In addition, experts say the situation in women’s jails is now worse than a decade ago, when a landmark report was commissioned amid widespread concerns about deteriorating standards.

In the 12 months to 16 September, there were 107 self-inflicted deaths in prisons in England and Wales – almost double that for 2012, when 57 people took their lives, and nearly seven times the 16 suicides in 1978, when the current recording system began.

Frances Crook, chief executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform, has used her blog to highlight that at least 26 prisoners have taken their life since Liz Truss was appointed secretary of state for justice in July, the equivalent to one suicide every three days. 



Crook, who describes suicides in prison as having reached “epidemic proportions”, said the situation was the worst she had known in her 30 years of campaigning.

“I haven’t seen anything like this, this is really, really bad,” she said. “There used to be enough experienced staff to know when someone was in distress, but they don’t have time to talk to anyone, there simply aren’t enough of them.

“I’ve been in prisons recently where you have two uniformed officers on duty with several hundred men on the wings. All they can do is go along the landings and open all the doors to allow people to fetch their lunch and then go back down the landings and shut all the doors again. They can’t say anything to anybody because they haven’t got time.”

Last Sunday, Celeste Craig, 26, became the 19th woman prisoner to take her own life this year. With two months of the year still to go, the number dwarfs the levels of a decade ago when the Corston report warned that too many women were being jailed for minor offences while their mental health needs, addiction problems and troubled backgrounds went largely ignored.

“I was commissioned to write my report in 2006 because in two years, 2003 and 2004, a total of 13 women took their own lives in prison,” Lady Corston said. “Now we’ve had 19 in one year which is a scandal.”

The Corston report made 43 recommendations, but much of its impact has been reversed, she said. “In 2003 there were 9,000 women taken into our prisons,” she said. “In 2009, two years after my report, it went down to 5,724. 



“Now, at a time of staff cuts, there are 11,000 women going through our prisons this year. We are back to the same old story. Women prisoners, who are 21 times more likely [than average] to commit suicide, are being sent to prison for ridiculously short times and nothing is achieved. I am very depressed about it all.”

Deborah Coles, director of Inquest, branded the death toll in women’s prisons as unacceptable. “We see the brutal consequences of criminal justice policies that see prison as the default solution and incarcerate some of the most disadvantaged women in prisons that are ill-equipped to keep them safe. These deaths raise the question as to why women were in prison in the first place.”

The rest of the prison system is also experiencing profound problems. Statistics published by the Ministry of Justice show that the death rate in prisons in England and Wales – which includes suicides, natural causes and homicide – has risen to almost one a day. 



In the 12 months to the end of June 2016, assaults in men’s prisons rose to a record high at 22,915 – an increase of 69% in only three years. Over the same period there were 36,440 incidents of self-injury – equivalent to 100 per day.

The crisis comes as Truss prepares to make her first major speech as justice secretary this week. She told the Observer that prison reform was her priority and that she was committed to making jails safer.

“These statistics demonstrate the serious violence and self-harm in our prisons,” Truss said. 



“The consequences are devastating and go far beyond the confines of the prison walls, spilling out into our streets and communities. That is why I have invested an initial £14m at 10 of our most challenging prisons, and shortly I will be publishing a white paper outlining the much needed reform across the prison estate to 2020 and beyond.”

But Crook said the crisis merited a more urgent response. “Legislation will be introduced some time next year, by which time 100 people will have taken their own lives. She [Truss] has to do something now,” she said.

“It’s deeply distressing that this sort of thing is still happening almost 10 years after the Corston inquiry,” said Ben Summerskill, director of the Criminal Justice Alliance, who pointed out that half of all prisoners return to jail after release. 



“If we had any other industry in the country where half the products got returned to the factory, ministers would have acted decades ago,” he said.

In 18th century London and the first half of the 19th, debt and its effects ate at the soul of society, as they do now. The difference was that in those days, debt was always personal. Those who owed did not fear credit card demands or banks, but people, streets and areas they knew. “It impacted on personal space,” explains distinguished London historian Jerry White. “People were moving around London all the time to avoid their creditors – moving rooms, avoiding certain streets or areas.” And failure to avoid could be disastrous: for want of as little as a few shillings, you could be thrown into a death pit of a jail.

The subject of White’s new book is London’s most notorious debtors’ prison, the Marshalsea in Southwark. Mansions of Misery, his biography of the institution, which stood on two different sites on what is now Borough High Street, begins by describing London’s vast landscape of debt and its ubiquity in everyday life. Fearful debtors were everywhere. So were places for locking them up – London had more jails than any other city in Europe. Those dodging incarceration up could take refuge in The Mint, an area near the Marshalsea, which enjoyed an anomalous legal status protecting them from arrest.

The Mint took its name from a coin-making facility founded by Henry VIII. That irony may have seemed the more crushing given that the debt problem was worsened by an undersupply of ready cash. “There was a shortage of copper coin and silver throughout all of the 18th century, particularly at the beginning,” says White. “So bills tended to accumulate. If you were very poor, a bill of two shillings and sixpence, if you didn’t have the coppers to pay it, could become a big amount to find.”

The Marshalsea, originally located by the present-day Mermaid Court, began as holding cells for the ancient Marshalsea Court, narrowly avoided being razed by the Great Fire of Southwark in 1676 and in 1727 was leased to one of its former turnkeys, William Acton, a local butcher who, until he was removed in 1730, ran it as a cruel and extortionate private enterprise. By that time, debtors, both women and men, formed the core clientele. In the Marshalsea, they ran up more debts, as they failed to pay their rent or lawyers’ fees. Prisoners were fleeced, starved and tortured with instruments of medieval vintage.

There was, though, a physical class divide between those on “the common side” of the jail, who were crammed like sardines in filth, and those on the master’s side, whose existence was privileged by comparison. White devotes a chapter to the extraordinary prison diary of successful musician John Baptist Grano, a chancer and social climber who was detained at the Marhsalsea for 16 months. He wrote his journal every day, paying particular attention to the meals he ate, some of them lavish, while others starved to death next door – 300 of them in the space of three months in 1729. “Today, we’d call Grano a foodie,” White says.

Grano had deals with Acton, which enabled him to give lessons and even leave the jail to visit bars and to perform. He got his own room, a derelict one he had done up by other prisoners - debtor craftsmen who sold him their skills as part of jail’s often desperate internal economy. “Grano had money, he just wouldn’t pay people,” White says. But his prison life was not all roasts and songs. There were rows and vendettas against him. He was a closet Roman Catholic. He lived in fear of banishment to the common side.

White documents the Marshalsea being run by dual power structures: the official one and that devised by the prisoners. The latter was so established and overt that when inmates were marched down the road to the new Marshalsea on Christmas Eve 1811, they carried a rulebook with them. Prisoners called the jail a college. The rulebook was redrafted by a lawyer collegian and is now lodged in the national archives. Discipline was enforced by an executive committee. Offences including soiling toilet seats, urinating in the wrong parts of the outdoor area, stealing and violence, though committee sanctions could be violent too.

One chair of the executive was the new Marhshalsea’s most famous prisoner, John Dickens, father of Charles, whose writings, notably Little Dorrit, are infused with sober insights gained from the incarceration of his dad. Dickens Snr was sent down thanks to the legal action of a Camden baker, to whom he owed £40. Still receiving his full salary from the Royal Navy Pay Office, he could have coughed up and been released, but, as White writes, this would have “put him at the mercy of a pack of others, eager for a bite at his person”. He got out thanks to the 1824 Insolvent Debtors Act. This basically enabled all his creditors to cut their losses by accepting a portion of his total assets.

There are many other remarkable characters in White’s book. In 1840, optician Joshua Reeve Lowe seized and disarmed a would-be assassin of Queen Victoria. A year and a half later, he entered the Marshalsea having mistakenly believed his heroism would endear him to a more upmarket clientele. In 1742, Irish writer Laetitia Pilkington was arrested in Duke Street for owing her landlady rent, called a “Papist bitch” by the bailiffs who came for her, and was soon rehoused in what was named “the worst prison in England”. Prizefighter Bishop “The Bishop” Sharpe’s descent from glory took him there after his failure to adjust to a more mundane way of life after losing a 90-minute, 91-round bout to Alec Reid, the “Chelsea Snob”, in 1828.

It is primarily through the stories of the prisoners that White skilfully and meticulously recounts the prison’s history. In doing so he shines a wider light on London in those times. “The debtor’s prison overshadowed the lives of working people and the middle classes in London,” he says. “What I think is so interesting is that the whole regime of capitalism thought it needed this draconian measure of arrest and imprisonment, sometimes for a long time, as a way of disciplining the whole world of credit. They thought that without it, the whole system of credit, trust and borrowing would collapse, and with it the value of money and trade.”

Jailed debtors were casualties of those anxieties. All paid a heavy price, many of the poorest with their lives.

Children in the child protection system are 14 times more likely to also be involved in the youth justice system and Indigenous children under child protection are more than 28 times more likely, according to a new report.

The correlation also works in reverse, with children in the youth justice system 15 times more likely to also be known to the child protection system than children who have not been in trouble with the law.

The results come from a report by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, using new linked data sets that allow researchers to track individual children through both systems.

It examined reports of 30,402 children aged 10 to 17 who were known to either the child protection system or the youth justice system in Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania, Queensland or the Australian Capital Territory in 2014-15. Linked data for the Northern Territory and Western Australia, which make up 53.8% of children in the child protection system and 48.7% of those in the youth justice system, was not available.

A third of all children in the youth justice system, which included community orders, had a child protection notification for the same year.

When only children in detention were considered, the rate increased to four out of five, making children in detention 19 times more likely to be known to the child protection system than children in the general community.

The younger a child was at their first contact with the youth justice system, the more likely they were to also be known to child protection: three out of five of those who had their first contact with the justice system at the age of 10 were known to child protection, compared with less than one in 10 of those who did not come into contact with the justice system until they were 17.

It comes after the Victorian commissioner for Aboriginal children and young people, Andrew Jackomos, called for a radical overhaul of the state’s child protection system, which, he said, was failing Koori children.

Jackomos released findings of a 59% increase in the number of Indigenous children in Victoria in out-of-home care between 2013 and 2015, and that many were denied cultural connection.

Indigenous children make up 20% of children in out-of-home care in Victoria, despite only being 1% of the population.

Nationally, Indigenous children are 27 times more likely to be in youth detention than non-Indigenous children. They make up 54% of detainees, despite only being 3% of the population.

The institute’s report found 11.3% of Indigenous boys in out-of-home care were also known to the youth justice system, compared with 7.5% of non-Indigenous boys, 6.6% of Indigenous girls and 3.3% of non-Indigenous girls.

Seen from the other angle, 51.9% of Indigenous girls in youth detention were also known to the child protection system, compared with 49.2% of non-Indigenous girls, 40.2% of non-Indigenous boys and 36.2% of Indigenous boys.

Justices will hear the appeal from a Virginia school board about whether 17-year-old Gavin Grimm will be able to use the boys’ restroom at his high school
###########################################################
The supreme court will take up transgender rights for the first time in the case of a Virginia school board that wants to prevent a transgender teenager from using the boys’ bathroom at his high school.

The justices said on Friday they will hear the appeal from the Gloucester County school board some time next year. The order means that student Gavin Grimm will not be able to use the boys’ bathroom in the meantime.

A lower court had ordered the school board to accommodate Grimm, but the justices in August put that order on hold while they considered whether to hear the appeal.

Grimm, a 17-year-old high school senior, was born female but identifies as male. He was allowed to use the boys’ restroom at his high school for several weeks in 2014.

After some parents complained, the school board adopted a policy requiring students to use either the restroom that corresponds with their biological gender or a private, single-stall restroom.

Grimm is backed by the Obama administration in his argument that the policy violates Title IX, a federal law that bars sex discrimination in schools.

“I continue to suffer daily because of the school board’s decision to make my bathroom use a matter of public debate,” Grimm said in a column published in the Washington Post.

“I feel the humiliation every time I need to use the restroom and every minute I try to ‘hold it’ in the hopes of avoiding the long walk to the nurse’s office.”

The US education department says transgender students should be allowed to use restrooms and locker rooms consistent with their gender identities. Among the issues in the case is whether the department’s guidance should have the force of law.

Similar lawsuits are pending around the country. The Obama administration has sued North Carolina over a state law aimed at restricting transgender students to bathrooms that correspond to their biological gender.

A federal judge in Texas has sided with the state and 12 others in issuing a nationwide hold on the administration’s directive to public schools, issued in May. The directive tells schools to allow transgender students to use the bathroom and locker room consistent with their gender identity.

The supreme court split five to three in August to put the court order in Grimm’s case on hold. At the time, Justice Stephen Breyer said he was providing a fifth vote to go along with the four more conservative justices to “preserve the status quo” until the court decided whether to weigh in. Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan dissented.

Grimm had urged the court not to take up his case. The school board asked the court to settle the matter now. It said that allowing Grimm to use the boys’ restroom raised privacy concerns and could cause some parents to pull their children out of school.

The fourth US circuit court of appeals in Richmond sided with Grimm in April, saying the federal judge who previously dismissed Grimm’s Title IX discrimination claim ignored the education department’s guidance on bathroom use.

The appeals court reinstated Grimm’s Title IX claim and sent it back to the district court for further consideration. The judge then issued the order in favor of Grimm.

Yaseen Aslam. James Farrar. Remember those two names, because they are giant-killers. This summer the men took on not just one £50bn multinational, but an entire business model. On Friday, they won.

As minicab drivers for Uber, Aslam and Farrar were deemed to be self-employed. The status meant they were denied the most basic rights that other workers take: no minimum wage, no sick pay, no paid holiday. But as an employment tribunal judge heard over several days in July, that classification was both wrong and unfair. And he agreed.



The obvious thing to say about Anthony Snelson’s ruling is that it is huge. It poses an existential threat to Uber in Britain. It will also send shockwaves through a string of companies using the same business model to do everything from delivering takeaways to providing cleaners to couriering court documents.



Most of all, it is a massive boost for all of us who want a fairer jobs market – and a big slap in the face for the government. For most of the past six years, ministers have turned a blind eye to the growth in bogus self-employment, zero-hours contracts and Sports Direct-style agency work. They have preferred instead to celebrate the record employment numbers as proof that austerity is doing the trick. Just before the last election, Nick Clegg claimed: “If you want a glimpse of the sort of worker that will thrive in the new economy, you need look no further than the growing numbers of self-employed people.”



On this subject too, the hapless Lib Dem was wrong. The idea that the swelling army of self-employed Britons are all budding SurAlans and Bransons, swigging lattes and toting MacBooks, is for the birds. Serious labour-market analysts agree that a large number of those now in self-employment are there as a last resort. And many believe a big chunk should not even be classed as self-employed. As with much else in our insecure labour market, firm numbers are hard to come by. But the Citizens Advice Bureaux believe that the reserve army of bogus self-employed may number around half a million.



For some Britons, self-employment doubtless means freedom. But for others, it means the freedom to be exploited, deprived of rights – and to be underpaid. According to recent research from the Resolution Foundation, the typical self employed Brit is now earning less than when John Major was prime minister.

For the likes of Uber, self-employment is hugely profitable. The giant company has 40,000 drivers working for it in Britain – and as long as they are self-employed they are almost cost-free. On that basis, Uber can keep on adding to its fleet of drivers for next to nothing, and thus rack up ever more passengers and squeeze out competitors.

But as the judge found on Friday, Uber drivers are not self-employed at all. They have little of the liberty you might expect, but are instead interviewed, recruited and controlled by the firm. Uber sets their default driving routes. Uber fixes the fares. Uber instructs them on how to do their job and runs a disciplinary procedure. The drivers work for Uber – not the other way round.

As the ruling observes, the company and its highly-paid boosters do their best to cloak this relationship in the language of chummy marketing and hi-tech piety. They use the term “gig economy”, when what they mean is casualised labour. They claim to be “disrupters”, when what they’re really disrupting are our labour laws. And Uber still markets itself like a plucky underdog when it is now worth $62.5bn – more than Tesco and Barclays put together – and numbers among its public affairs and public relations people the former advisers to Ed Balls and Michael Howard. Pretending to be the future, it is really the past: a cab company that relies on its drivers being cheap and available. Except your local cab firm doesn’t have the lobbying muscle or the Westminster contacts.

Uber confirmed that it will appeal against the decision, and you can expect this case to keep the courts busy for a few months. Other businesses that have copied the Uber model will be watching anxiously. And so will their workers.

A few months back, I interviewed a courier called Mags Dewhurst, whose job is biking urgent medical supplies to hospitals around London. Like most other cycle couriers and drivers, she’s also classified as self-employed; she’s also fighting to change her status. Next month she will be battling her company, CitySprint, in court.

Dewhurst has a strong case. She wears a uniform with a logo, clocks in with a controller each morning. And then: “For 50 hours each week, I’m told what to do.” She’s been impatient for the Uber verdict, knowing that it will be of huge symbolic importance for her own case. On Friday afternoon, I texted her: How pleased are you?

In the tech-utopia of the on-demand economy it is said all can have prizes. Those providing the services in this brave new world supposedly hail the freedom of flexible hours and benefit from the surge-pricing that allows them to hike charges as demand rises. Customers, say the futurologists, love the convenience. There’s no doubt of the popularity of such apps as Uber, now the world’s most valuable startup. More than 30,000 Uber drivers whizz around London alone. The rise of such “gig” jobs, where you start work by opening an app on a smartphone and end when you swipe out, has disrupted traditional patterns of employment.

What today’s landmark employment tribunal has done is challenge the business logic that suggests Uber drivers are not toiling for the firm but entrepreneurs working for themselves. In Uberworld its drivers are customers who pay to access an app that links them with rides. Uber just takes a cut. Why, reckons the company, would it pay drivers wages or benefits when they are its clients? The judges have rightly refuted this key premise of the “gig economy”. Instead they ruled that Uber drivers are “workers” who are entitled to the national minimum wage and holiday pay. The central question was one of control: the more autonomous a person is in how they do the job, the more likely they are to be self-employed. The drivers’ testimony in the case was pretty damning. One said he was put under “tremendous pressure” to work long hours and accept jobs, adding there were “repercussions” from the company if he cancelled a pickup. He claimed that some months he earned as little as £5 an hour, well below the national living wage. In a ruling that quotes Shakespeare and Milton, the pithiest point was lifted from a Californian ruling: “Uber does not simply sell software; it sells rides.”

This is not the last word. The company has said it will appeal – and there are another three rounds to get through. Nonetheless the judgment clearly makes the case that Uber is in charge of its drivers’ working lives and conditions. While the findings apply to just the two drivers who brought the case, it will embolden other Uber drivers to bring similar claims, as well as others working in the “gig economy”. In America new technology companies – such as online grocery store Instacart – have decided to change their workers’ employment status before being forced to.

In Britain the backdrop to Uber’s rise is the growth in self-employed workers – whose ranks are swelling while their incomes are shrinking. They account for more than one in seven of the workforce but earn less on average than they did in 1995. It cannot be right that a ever-larger slice of the labour market is without holiday pay or maternity leave. This moral sentiment will be tested next month when a slew of cases involving cycle couriers in London dispute their status as self-employed contractors. Like the Uber drivers they want to be classified as workers, which would bring employment rights, including holiday pay. What is clear is that ducking out of paying benefits is not a fair route to profits. The lawsuits also raise questions over whether the tax incentive is right: at present a company pays 13.8% national insurance on employees’ wages but none for the self-employed. That’s why it’s good that MPs and the government will look at this. As a first step we need to measure, like the US authorities, how big the gig economy really is. An estimated 6% of Brits are earning income from gig-jobs. Once we know the scale of the problem elected representatives can design laws that account for the world in which the public works.

Uber drivers are not self-employed and should be paid the “national living wage”, a UK employment court has ruled in a landmark case which could affect tens of thousands of workers in the gig economy.

The ride-hailing app could now be open to claims from all of its 40,000 drivers in the UK, who are currently not entitled to holiday pay, pensions or other workers’ rights. Uber immediately said it would appeal against the ruling.

Employment experts said other firms with large self-employed workforces could now face scrutiny of their working practices and the UK’s biggest union, Unite, announced it was setting up a new unit to pursue cases of bogus self-employment.

Research by Citizens Advice has suggested that as many as 460,000 people could be falsely classified as self-employed, costing up to £314m a year in lost tax and employer national insurance contributions. Four courier firms are already facing legal action from cyclists who want similar recognition as staff employees and the rights that go with that status, while delivery firm Hermes is under investigation by HM Revenue & Customs.

The Uber ruling could force a rethink of the gig economy business model, where companies use apps and the internet to match customers with workers. The firms do not employ the workers, but take commission from their earnings, and many have become huge global enterprises. Uber now operates around the world, with the company valued at more than £50bn.

The decision of the employment tribunal comes amid mounting concern within government about the growing trend towards self-employed workforces. The government has recently announced a six-month review of modern working practices and HMRC is setting up a new unit, the employment status and intermediaries team, to investigate firms.

MPs launched an inquiry last week into pay and working conditions in the UK which will look at the status and rights of agency and casual workers and the self-employed for the purposes of tax, benefits and employment law, and how to protect them.

Friday’s ruling by a London employment tribunal involves a case taken by two drivers, James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam, on behalf of a group 19 Uber workers who argued that they were employed by the San Francisco-based firm, rather than working for themselves.

At a hearing in July, Farrar told how he was put under “tremendous pressure” to work long hours and accept jobs and said that there were “repercussions” from the company if he cancelled a pickup. He said some months he earned as little as £5 an hour – far below the £7.20 that employers are obliged to pay workers aged over 25.

Uber argued that it was a technology firm not a transport business and that its drivers were independent self-employed contractors who could choose where and when they worked.

The judges were scathing about Uber’s arguments, however, accusing the firm of “resorting in its documentation to fictions, twisted language and even brand new terminology” and even quoting Hamlet to suggest that the group’s UK boss was protesting too much about its position.

“The notion that Uber in London is a mosaic of 30,000 small businesses linked by a common ‘platform’ is to our minds faintly ridiculous,” the judges said. “Drivers do not and cannot negotiate with passengers … They are offered and accept trips strictly on Uber’s terms.”

Nigel Mackay from the employment team at law firm Leigh Day, which represented the drivers, said: “We are pleased that the employment tribunal has agreed with our arguments that drivers are entitled to the most basic workers’ rights, including to be paid the [national living wage] and to receive paid holiday, which were previously denied to them.

“This is a ground-breaking decision. It will impact not just on the thousands of Uber drivers working in this country, but on all workers in the so-called gig economy whose employers wrongly classify them as self-employed and deny them the rights to which they are entitled.”

The GMB union, which took up the case for the drivers, said that it was a “monumental victory” which would have an impact on thousands of workers in other industries “where bogus self-employment is rife”.

Maria Ludkin, GMB’s legal director, said: “Uber drivers and thousands of others caught in the bogus self-employment trap will now enjoy the same rights as employees. This outcome will be good for passengers, too. Properly rewarded drivers are the same side of the coin as drivers who are properly licensed and driving well-maintained and insured vehicles.”

Farrar said he was thrilled with the “emphatic” ruling. He said his industry had seen the deterioration in workers’ rights since Uber entered the market. “We’ve brought that to a halt,” he said.

Employment experts said that other firms with large self-employed workforces could now face similar action. “This judgment is likely to have massive implications, as we see an increasing number of start-up businesses effectively adopting Uber’s model,” said Tim Goodwin of law firm Winckworth Sherwood. “The effect of this judgment is that those kinds of business may owe a lot more to their workers, such as paid holiday and minimum wage, than they had bargained for.”

The ruling should be regarded as “ a salutary lesson by businesses who try to arbitrarily ‘classify’ workers as contractors to avoid affording them their full rights as workers,” Goodwin said.

The GMB’s Ludkin said employers should be “on notice” that it was reviewing similar contracts. “This is old-fashioned exploitation under new-fangled jargon, but the law will force you to pay GMB members what they are rightfully due,” she said.

There were calls for more clarity over employment status, with Citizens Advice pointing out that many people were locked out of employment tribunals by fees of up to £1,200.

“The fact it takes an employment tribunal to decide whether these drivers are self-employed shows that proving employment status is an extremely complicated and costly process,” said its chief executive, Gillian Guy. “For many people struggling at the sharp end of insecure work, such as in false self-employment, taking such a case is simply not an option.”

The ruling is not the end of the process for Uber. The firm will take the case to the employment appeal tribunal, and following its decision there could be further hearings in the court of appeal and then the supreme court. Any payments due to drivers will not be calculated until that process is over.

Other drivers with the firm will not automatically receive payouts but, if the firm accepts the ruling, it will have to change its contracts to avoid more cases being taken by drivers. Lawyers say that its terms and conditions are similar for all of its UK employees.

Jo Bertram, the regional general manager of Uber in the UK, said many of the firm’s drivers did not want to be classified as workers: “Tens of thousands of people in London drive with Uber precisely because they want to be self-employed and their own boss.

“The overwhelming majority of drivers who use the Uber app want to keep the freedom and flexibility of being able to drive when and where they want.”

Ken King is a veteran of the US navy. He worked for 25 years as a policeman in southern Virginia. After retiring at the rank of lieutenant, he took command of a military unit guarding the prison camp at Guantánamo Bay.

King does not, therefore, conform to the Donald Trump caricature of those who protest against killings by police officers. And yet King knows what he knows. He will tell you about a preventable error by police that had deadly consequences on two occasions. It may, in fact, be the most serious single institutional failing in US policing to come to light since Ferguson, Missouri, erupted into civil unrest in 2014.

The Guardian first reported in June last year that King, who then went unidentified, had warned senior commanders at Portsmouth police department about the dangers posed by one of the officers under his command. The officer was Stephen Rankin.

Officer Rankin was receiving too many complaints about his use of force, King told them, such as using his Taser to shock a 60-year-old grandmother during a dispute about her car being towed, and wrestling a 15-year-old girl to the ground in a routine confrontation.

“There are some people who come into law enforcement who are not suited for the job,” says King, who is softly spoken but intense. “Stephen Rankin was one of those people.”

Rankin had the capacity to “cause a riot at a church social,” as King puts it. “He could go to any event and it would just escalate out of control in some way.”

Previously reluctant to speak publicly, King agreed to be interviewed for a powerful documentary, which builds on the Guardian’s reporting, and airs on BBC2 on Wednesday.

King says he asked internal affairs investigators working for Portsmouth police chief Ed Hargis to look into the repeated complaints about Rankin’s excessive force, but the officer was allowed to continue policing the public. Later, after finding that Rankin was also falsely claiming overtime pay, King says he wrote to Hargis recommending the officer be fired from his job. He wasn’t.

Then, one evening in 2011, Rankin shot dead an unarmed young man while responding to a 911 call. One morning last year, he did it again.

“We missed an opportunity to get rid of this officer a long time ago,” says King. “And no one’s better off because we didn’t do that.”

Portsmouth is an old harbour and plantation town, part of the Tidewater region, about halfway down the Atlantic coast. More than half of its 96,000 residents are black. Its colonial heritage and contemporary culture mix curiously. US naval vessels are still repaired and upgraded at its vast 250-year-old shipyard, which was once a useful outpost for the British crown. It is also the birthplace of Missy Elliott, the rapper and producer. Rankin, like many men in the area, landed in Portsmouth with the US navy. As a 22-year-old raised in California, he had met Cori Johnson, a 17-year-old rebel from an evangelical Christian family. He proposed after six weeks. They married and had a daughter. She followed him across the US on his naval postings and waited while he was deployed as a military policeman to Kuwait, to aid the US war effort in Iraq.

Discharged in Portsmouth in 2007 after five years, Rankin decided to become a policeman. He was rejected by several departments for having used methamphetamine in his youth. “I did it ONE TIME when I was 16,” he complained later, on an online forum. But Rankin was eventually accepted at Portsmouth, a department with a strong military streak thanks to the local base.

Johnson told the documentary makers that as complaints from the public about his violence piled up, Rankin said they merely proved he was doing his job properly. He also became obsessed with a particular premise for a police officer opening fire on a suspect. He would return to this hypothetical constantly in conversations with colleagues, she said.

“Don’t you think you’d be justified in shooting somebody if they put their hand on their waistband?” he would ask.

Rankin’s marriage began to deteriorate, and ended in divorce. King’s efforts to have Rankin removed from the streets were in vain. But on the evening of 23 April 2011, Rankin answered a 911 call reporting someone banging on the front door of an apartment building in Portsmouth’s historic Olde Towne area.

Kirill Denyakin, a cook from Kazakhstan who was living in the town, had been drinking too much while out with friends. Denyakin had ended up outside the apartment building in question, where he had been staying, and began rapping incessantly on the glass door. Footage from a dashboard camera in Rankin’s car shows the officer arriving in response to the 911 call and leaping over a grass verge. Seconds after he disappears from view, 11 gunshots are heard.

Photographs taken at the scene showed that Denyakin ended up with his jeans around his ankles. Friends suggested he had been urinating. Certainly he had no weapon. But Rankin claimed he had been forced to fire his gun repeatedly because the 26-year-old turned, charged toward the officer aggressively – and reached into his waistband.

“When I read his statement in the newspaper, that he had said ‘hand on the waistband’, a chill went up my spine,” said Johnson. “I realised this was not a standard line-of-duty shooting. I realised this was what he’d been waiting for.”

King adds: “I think you could have put 100 other officers in that same situation and you would not have had that same outcome.”

In those pre-Ferguson days, Rankin avoided criminal charges and the national spotlight. Denyakin’s family sued in the civil courts for $22m (£18m). After they rejected an offer of a small settlement, however, the jury at trial sided with Rankin, accepting his claim that he was forced to fire because he feared for his life, and awarding the family no damages. Denyakin’s mother, Yelena, went home distraught and empty-handed. Denyakin’s family had also come under attack in the comments section of the Virginian-Pilot, their local newspaper. “22 mil wont buy your boy back,” wrote one observer, under the username yourealythinkthat.

Most Americans, the commenter said, could not hope to earn such a sum in their entire career, “let alone a habitual drunk working as a hotel cook”. Speaking under oath six months and 246 comments later, Rankin admitted that he was actually yourealythinkthat.

The killing caused a diplomatic incident. Officials from Kazakhstan, a key central Asian ally for the US in post-9/11 conflicts, made their anger known to the State Department. Concerns were relayed to the authorities in Portsmouth, who also faced a furore over Facebook postings from the previous two years that showed Rankin, a firearms obsessive, referring to his gun container as “Rankin’s box of vengeance”.

Rankin was put on administrative duties, leaving him stuck behind a desk for the following two years and nine months, until things blew over. But then he was let out again.

“Not only was he told it was OK, but in his world, he was empowered by it,” Johnson says in the documentary. “It made him a hero. It made him a badass. Why give that up? Why stop?”

When a security worker at the town’s Walmart store called 911 early on 22 April last year to report a suspected shoplifting, the US was in a state of acute anxiety. It was only eight months since Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, had been shot dead in Ferguson, and the aftershocks were still felt.

Protests spread to major cities. A long-dormant debate about race and policing was forced back to the top of the domestic political agenda. And the discord was about to enter a second phase. In Baltimore, Maryland, 22-year-old Freddie Gray had just died of a broken neck after being driven around shackled in the back of a police van without a seatbelt. Demonstrations turned into clashes with police, rioting and arson.

It meant the country was already preoccupied by the in-custody death of a young African American man when Rankin took that early-morning 911 call and confronted 18-year-old William Chapman in the Walmart’s vast car park.

Rankin was not in a good mood. “I hate this job,” Rankin, who was 34, had told a colleague in a mobile message about an hour earlier. “Seen too much bad and not enough good.” The colleague brushed aside his complaints, but Rankin insisted. “The city sucks, but so does the rest of the world. People are just bad,” he said. He made an allusion to the condemned biblical cities of Sodom and Gomorrah.

Then, as Rankin tried to detain Chapman, the 18-year-old defied him. “Take your hand out your pocket,” Rankin said, as they began to struggle at Rankin’s squad car. “Take your hand out your pocket.” Rankin drew his Taser, which had an in-built camera that recorded their exchange. “You’re not gonna Tase me, cos you’re not gonna arrest me for nothing,” Chapman told him, before knocking the Taser to the ground. The pair split apart and stood face to face, separated by the car.

What happened next is sharply disputed. A Walmart security worker, a young black man named Gregory Provo, said Chapman took a “jab step” – an upper-body jerk meant to make an opponent flinch. “He never charged, he just made a gesture,” said Provo. Rankin and some white builders working nearby claimed that Chapman advanced towards the officer. No one, however, disputes that Chapman was unarmed.

Rankin fired his Glock pistol twice in quick succession. Chapman was struck in the face and chest. The 18-year-old died almost instantly, becoming one of 306 African-Americans killed by police last year, as recorded by an award-winning Guardian project, called The Counted.

According to King, the retired lieutenant, it needn’t have happened.

“He was given chance after chance,” King says of Rankin. “Sometimes tragic things happen that can’t be prevented, and there was no chance to try to avoid it. But in this case, it could have been avoided.”

After his second killing, Rankin faced a drastically different situation. The number of officers charged with crimes for deadly shootings in 2015 across the country was three times higher than in recent years. Meanwhile, in Portsmouth, the white, male Republican prosecutor who oversaw Rankin’s avoidance of charges for killing Denyakin was gone. In his place was Stephanie Morales, a recently elected black Democrat, just 31 years old.

In August last year, Morales announced that she would pursue criminal charges against Rankin for killing Chapman. The following month, a grand jury returned an indictment of first-degree murder – still a highly unusual charge for a police shooting. Rankin was also terminated from his job.

The documentary follows Rankin and the Chapmans through the murder trial, which spanned two sweltering weeks in summer. As a steady stream of controversial shootings by police continued to flow across the US, extensive security measures were installed at Portsmouth courthouse, where officers stationed on the roof scanned the area for potential danger.

Rankin was protected by a coterie of armed deputies dressed like soldiers. “We had some pretty credible threats on our lives,” said his second wife, Dawn.

Funded by her friends and neighbours, Yelena Denyakin flew back to Virginia to see Rankin in the dock. Jointly determined to see him punished this time, Denyakin and Sallie Chapman, William’s mother, forged an unlikely partnership “Rankin didn’t just kill my son,” said Denyakin. “He destroyed our whole family.”

“If I get justice, then we get justice together,” said Chapman.

Unshaven and dishevelled, the former officer gave his first and only public interview for the film, breaking an unspoken omertà among officers that typically follows deadly encounters. “Having to shoot someone,” said Rankin, is “not as easy as it looks in the movies.”

While offering sympathy to the Chapmans, Rankin remains convinced of his propriety, and aggrieved at his treatment, which he contrasts with the “three weeks and a medal” – paid leave and a commendation for bravery – that he claims ordinarily would be expected. “I did exactly what I was trained to do,” said Rankin. “I did my job, and I really feel like I’m being punished for doing exactly what I was supposed to do.”

Pre-trial wrangling resulted in rulings that jurors would not hear about Rankin’s first deadly shooting. Nor, though, would they learn of childhood offences committed by Chapman, who was sent to a juvenile prison after bringing to school a cigarette lighter styled like a pistol.

Inside the courtroom, America’s troubling racial divide played out in miniature. Morales was joined in prosecuting Rankin by her black deputy; Rankin’s attorneys were white. While one half of the public gallery filled each morning with Rankin’s white supporters, Chapman’s family filled the other side with black friends and activists. Even eyewitnesses and jurors divided along racial lines.

The days were thick with tension. “He and his wife are sitting there peacefully,” Yelena Denyakin said during one sunny lunch break. “Soon their peace should come to an end.”

Morales, styled as naive by local media for daring to charge an officer with murder, was fighting for her political future. She faced off aggressively against attorney James Broccoletti, a grizzled veteran defending Rankin after getting a man cleared of murder despite his fingerprints being found on bags the body was wrapped in.

Rankin, facing a potential life sentence if convicted, was clinging to his freedom, to his chances of working again as a police officer – and to his right to ever again own a gun.

“I believe it’s not just me that’s on trial,” said Rankin. “I believe it’s all American police officers.”

When Asif Hanif signed up to work for Uber just over two years ago, he says that like other new drivers he was promised he would be earning £500 a week. 



However, the huge growth in the number of drivers and the forcing down of fares by the company has, he says, resulted in his pay falling by around a third since 2014. It has left him and many others often earning significantly less than the minimum wage, he claims.

The 45-year-old married father of two who lives in Hounslow, west London, declared the ruling on Friday as a victory for working people across the UK. 



“When I started for Uber, I was taking home around £500 to £600 a week which sounds fine, but once I’ve paid all the costs it was much less than promised. But over the last two years, Uber has been on this massive expansion plan which has lowered our money.

“I recently took four passengers from Camden to west Ealing [a journey of 11 miles] at three o’clock in the morning for which I received £16 after Uber’s 20% commission was deducted. The company wants fares so low that passengers won’t go elsewhere, but it’s the drivers who have paid the price. The fares are just too low to live on.”

Hanif said Uber expected to him to have a new car – in his case a leased Toyota Prius Plus which costs him £375 per month. His insurance is another £177 and he has to pay for fuel and to keep both himself and the car smart, for fear of upsetting the passengers, who can give him negative feedback – and potentially end his work – at any moment.

Speaking after it had been announced that the drivers had won, Hanif said it had been an easy decision to stand up to the company and join the legal challenge. 



“People say why don’t you just give up and do something else, but I’ve got the car payments. We were not asking for any special treatment or anything like that – we were just asking for the laws of Britain to be applied – nothing else. It’s great that a court has stood up for working people,” he said.

Richard Fox, a senior solicitor and head of Kingsley Napley Solicitors, hails the legal ruling in favour of two Uber drivers that they should be classified as workers, not as self-employed. Speaking on Friday, Fox says employment law is now catching up with the way people work and emphasises that this is a comprehensive decision with further ramifications likely to happen. With drivers classified as workers, not as self-employed, Uber must now pay the national living wage

As a solicitor contacted by a friend of one of the men arrested in connection with the alleged plot in 2002 to kidnap Victoria Beckham, and asked to represent him, I recall when I attended Charing Cross police station where the suspects were being held following their arrest, finding to my surprise that the police that day knew about as much about the case as I did, or possibly a little less, as I’d had the advantage of reading the story splashed across the News of the World that morning.

This, of course, was because the case had been “investigated” and prepared by Mazher Mahmood, and then handed to the police as a fait accompli (‘Fake Sheikh’ jailed for 15 months, 22 October). I found it astonishing then and still do that this so-called journalist was allowed for so long to set up and investigate alleged crimes with none of the safeguards, professional standards and regulation that the police are subject to, including the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act which provides rules that police must follow when filming and recording suspects, and also dealing with informants.

The ultimate failure of the Beckham prosecution and many others at huge cost to the public purse, but to the great profit of News International and its newspapers, is one of the many scandalous aspects to this saga.

I cannot comment on whether the police have been actively corrupt in their dealings with that organisation, but I do believe they were, like so many other organs of state have been and are, utterly supine in the face of its perceived power and influence.

• The front page of Friday’s Daily Mail vividly illustrates what Andy Beckett was saying in his long read (Revenge of the tabloids, 27 October). The headline “A sick joke! NHS moans about lack of funds… but fails to collect hundreds of millions from health tourists” neatly implies that the NHS is short of funds through its own lazy incompetence (thus denigrating an essential public service that is gradually being run down by government policy), inflates the actual shortfall (reported by the Telegraph as about £250m), and implies that every foreign national using the NHS has come to the UK to benefit from free care. No wonder opinions are moving to the right under this stream of distorted half-information.

The employment tribunal judges who ruled that the Uber drivers are not self-employed and should be paid the “national living wage” were scathing in their assessment of the company. Among the most unequivocal sections of the judgment were the following:

40,000 The number of Uber drivers in the UK

£5 The hourly wage that one of the drivers who took the case claims he earned in some months

$62.5bn Uber’s valuation based on its last round of funding

7 The years that Uber has been in operation

460,000 The number of people who could be falsely classified as self-employed in the UK

£314m The yearly estimated cost in lost tax and employer national insurance contributions from falsely classified employees, according to Citizens Advice

The case brought against Uber by a group of its drivers has exposed the dark side of the gig economy. For many workers this is a rigged economy, where bosses can weasel out of paying the minimum wage or providing basics such as holiday pay and rest breaks.

Technological change should be a force for good. But increasingly employers are using it to duck their responsibilities. If you are a “self-employed” driver at Uber you can become a virtual a slave to the app. Miss a job alert and you can be “deactivated” without appeal. Fail to keep up your rating and you can be cast aside at any moment.

Being kept on a leash is not my definition of self-employment. Genuinely self-employed contractors can refuse jobs, set their own hours and subcontract work to others. That freedom to work when and how you want is why some self-employed people choose to give up the security that comes with a regular job. The security of knowing that if you fall sick, or just want to take a holiday, you don’t have to jeopardise your livelihood.

But if you work at firms like Uber or Deliveroo you enjoy none of those freedoms, and none of that security either. It is small surprise that many feel powerless and unable to speak out.

Today rosters are increasingly devised by computer and announced to workers with little or no notice. For many, working in the gig economy the only contact they have with their employer is through an app on their phone. This new model of working has led to a more atomised workforce. One where co-workers don’t regularly meet or share facilities. If you work for the likes of Uber you are very much a lone agent competing against others for jobs.

This has created a severe imbalance of power. It makes collective bargaining for fair pay and decent conditions far harder and gives companies more scope to reward executives and shareholders, while keeping pay down for their workers. Unions are not luddites. We recognise that the world of work is changing. But advances in technology should be used to make work better, not to return to the type of working practices we thought we’d seen the back of decades ago, and which trade unions were formed to fight against.

So what needs to change?

Precarious working has rightly shot up the political agenda, thanks in large part to the work of unions. GMB and Unite deserve huge credit for shining a light on working conditions at companies such as Uber, Asos and Sports Direct. The government announced this month a new independent review into employment regulations for the new economy, led by the RSA’s Matthew Taylor.

We want this to be a no-holds barred investigation into employment practices at the sharp of the end of the labour market. And, crucially, one that recognises the important role unions can play in dealing with the problem of insecure employment.

The TUC has long called for the introduction of modern wage councils. They’d work in specific sectors, like private hire, to set minimum pay and conditions. This would help stop some of the worst exploitation and increase transparency. We also want rules on “employment status” – including the definition of self-employment – to be tightened up. This is far too much of a grey area, which has allowed unscrupulous bosses to cut corners.

All working people should benefit from the same basic rights at work, including paid holiday, maternity/paternity leave, and protection from unfair dismissal. The law should presume that an individual is an employee, unless the employer can demonstrate they are genuinely self-employed and running a business of their own.

“Bogus” self-employment doesn’t just affect workers. It hurts the public purse too, as it allows companies to avoid paying national insurance contributions for their workforce. That can be worth millions.

We need to think more broadly about how technology can empower workers rather than enslave them. Cast your minds back to the 1960s and 70s. Then, people speculated that new technology would create in its wake a more leisured society. The reality has been anything but. It’s not just Uber drivers who are affected by this. Try telling the Amazon worker monitored every minute by GPS or the young professional checking their emails at 2am that they have been liberated. We’ve got to get the pendulum swinging the other way.

Part of that thinking must include how trade unions can take advantage of new technologies to organise workers. So that even those on the margins can have a collective voice. Whether it’s Deliveroo workers, Uber drivers or freelancers in the US, we’re already seeing what this might look like. Digital has huge potential for workers just as it does for employers.

That we are in the midst of a technological revolution every bit as transformative as the industrial revolution is not in doubt. The lives, life chances and livelihoods of millions of workers are in a state of flux. Our role isn’t to try to stop this progress, it’s to make sure that technology is used to make working people’s lives better, and to make sure the gains from new technology are fairly shared. The battle around Uber is far from over, and unions will be staying with it for Uber workers today and for the rest of us tomorrow.

One of the recurring concerns in recent years has been about whether local newspapers are carrying out one of their key public service functions: the coverage of courts.

In 2009, there were four separate claims that papers were failing to report court cases adequately. The Press Association’s managing director, Tony Watson, told a committee of MPs looking into the future of local press: “Things have got so bad in the regional press now courts and councils are not getting covered sufficiently”.

Marcel Berlins, the legal commentator, wrote in the Guardian of there being too few reporters to perform the “important task” of being “the eyes and ears of the public in our courts”.

Lord Judge, then the lord chief justice, told a Society of Editors conference that the absence of reporters in courts was a problem for the practice of open justice (a speech also touched on by Joshua Rozenberg, writing for the Law Gazette).

And Nick Davies, in his book Flat Earth News, asserted that it was “impossible to escape the conclusion that the number of court stories in both national and regional newspapers has fallen dramatically”.

In the seven years since, there has been plenty of anecdotal support for those views but precious little academic inquiry. Now come two small studies, reported in outline on The Justice Gap site, which indicate that the situation has anything but improved.

They were conducted by Brian Thornton, a former BBC2 Newsnight producer who now lectures in journalism at Winchester university.

In the first, regional and local editors were approached to answer a set of questions and 57 took part, although not all of them answered every question. 



They were asked whether they agreed or not with a statement made by Berlins in the 2009 article I mentioned above: “It is abundantly clear that the courts are no longer being properly reported”.

Of the 55 who answered, 56% agreed (with 11% strongly agreeing) while 44% disagreed (with 6% strongly disagreeing). 



In real terms, that equates to 31 editors agreeing and 24 disagreeing. The sample is obviously small, given that there are, say, 1,000 editors across Britain. So I think it fair to see this as an indication, a pointer, rather than any kind of conclusive proof. More details from this survey can be found below.

In a separate piece of research, Thornton updated a 2012 study carried out by a Birkbeck law school professor, Leslie Moran, which looked at the coverage of the courts in the national and regional papers on a single day.

Moran considered the content of eight nationals (Guardian, Times, Independent, Telegraph, Financial Times, Express, Mirror and Sun) plus five regionals (London Evening Standard, Manchester Evening News, Birmingham Mail, South Wales Echo, and Western Mail). He counted 82 court stories in those titles with a 27,225 total word count.

When Thornton repeated the exercise four years on, he found 57 court stories with an 18,954 word count. In both instances, that represented a 30% decrease.

But the fall was greater in the regionals, down from a total of 30 reports to just 18, some 40% fewer. A snapshot, of course, but it does imply a continuing decrease in court coverage.

Thornton, in noting that fewer court proceedings were being observed by anyone outside the legal profession, is alarmed that there was “virtually no lay oversight, no-one to highlight problems or malpractice”.

He says: “The fact that the media is engaging less and less with the everyday workings of the criminal justice system means that journalists are increasingly unaware of what actually happens in such important settings as crown courts or coroner’s courts.

“I would argue that this ignorance is dangerous because it spreads to the public. If the public aren’t being informed about what’s happening in courts, how can they be expected to know?”

One of his major worries about a lack of court coverage is the loss of historical records. This poses a problem for anyone investigating miscarriages of justice, he says.

“If newspapers are reducing the number of court reporters, along with reducing the number of stories they cover, then there is a growing number of cases that will be lost completely to the collective memory.

“Hundreds and hundreds of cases each year will go unrecorded – bizarrely becoming essentially secret trials because no one will have any information about them”.

Is there a dedicated court reporter at your newspaper? No, said 56%.



If you do not currently have a dedicated court reporter, did you have one in the last five years? 8% said that in the last five years they had a dedicated court reporter, but didn’t have one now.

If there is a court reporter at your paper, how often does he/she attend court? Once a week, said 62%.

How important is it to have a dedicated court reporter? 42% said it was useful, but not essential; 33% said it was very important; 21% said it was important; 4% said it wasn’t important.

If your newspaper covers court cases, where do you get your stories? 59% said they get their stories from a mix of reporters and agencies; 38% said it came entirely from their court reporter; 5% said they got it only from agencies.

Instead of sending a reporter or using agency copy – have you ever relied on a police press release for your court report? 55% said they would, 45% said they would not.

Has your court reporter at the paper used Twitter to report on a court case? 44% said they never have; 22% said rarely; 22% said sometimes; and 12% said often.

Do you think the courts are generally positive to journalists reporting on cases? 92% said they were.

NB: I appreciate the work done by Thornton, but I think we need comprehensive research - at courts and in newspaper offices alongside content analysis - to discover the true state of affairs.

When I first told the council I was homeless I was 16. It was cold, dark and I was alone. I didn’t have any belongings, but I had been staying at friends’ houses so I was clean and hadn’t been sleeping rough. I was forced to declare myself homeless when a brick was thrown through a friend’s window by a family member, and their safety was compromised. I waited to see the housing officer in my busy London borough, but when he arrived I was quickly dismissed on the grounds that I didn’t “look homeless”. What did I need to do to look homeless enough? I asked him. Did I need to be attacked? Raped? He looked at me, in his own helpless way, and shrugged.

That was 10 years ago. Today, Bob Blackman’s homelessness reduction bill will have its second reading in parliament. The main features of the bill are to remove the “priority need” category, and the requirement of being physically homeless before you are housed. Councils will have a duty to help those at risk of homelessness 56 days in advance, and to provide them with support for a further 56 days to secure accommodation. The government has announced its support for it.

And something certainly needs to be done. Homelessness has doubled since 2010 and seems be on course to rise further. And the proposals in the bill sound like good ideas in principle. The priority need list puts those who fit a certain criterion (those with children, mental health problems or other vulnerabilities and those under the age of 18) in a position to be housed quicker. However, in practice, this often turns into an easy excuse to turn people away without letting them speak to an officer, which they are entitled to, amid high housing pressures.

The other requirement to be axed, being physically homeless, cuts short the prospect of a preventative system. So those who see the possibility of having nowhere to live looming are told to come back when they are actually homeless and the situation might be harder to remedy. On a very basic level, the process requires homeless people to demonstrate they are homeless while obscuring this fact by asking them a set of unrelated questions. As a woman in BBC2’s documentary on the housing crisis in Barking and Dagenham put it: “[It] is crazy. Homeless is homeless.” Removing these criteria will make all homeless people a priority.

Elements of the bill have been taken from the Welsh model which was introduced in 2014 with great success. It is said to have led the culture change away from box-ticking to actually helping people in flexible and creative ways. There are, however, concerns about the ability to implement the policy in areas like London where there are huge housing pressures. The problem there is that there isn’t the place to put people.

I went through the system at a much more forgiving time, and fit both criteria: physically homeless because I was on the street with nowhere to go, and a priority need as a young woman fleeing domestic violence. Still it took three months for the council to accept I was entitled to housing. I spent three years in “temporary accommodation” – never intended as a long-term solution by its very definition. Eventually I went to university and I was taken off the housing list. That means that now, 10 years later, I have been pushed into private renting and still battle homelessness one pay cheque at a time. The issue was then, as it is now, not that housing officers didn’t want to help: they just had nowhere to put me.

The officials in Barking and Dagenham’s documentary spell out the problem very clearly. Policies like the right-to-buy scheme have depleted council housing stock, while successive governments have not been committed to replenishing it. This is combined with soaring rents and house prices that people can no longer afford; insecure wages and a tattered welfare system that means people turn up to the council with nowhere to go. This is not the story of unwilling bureaucrats, but of the concept of housing as a commodity rather than a right. Mandating staff to house people when they have nowhere to put them cannot change this issue. Priority or no priority, the question remains: where will the people go?

Two of the first legal challenges to Brexit have been rejected by a Belfast court.

A high court judge ruled that the Good Friday agreement in 1998 could not be used to grant Northern Ireland exemption from the UK’s decision to leave the European Union.

A victim of loyalist terrorism, Ulster politicians and community groups argued in court that because 56% of the Northern Ireland electorate voted to remain in the EU, the region’s devolved parliament should have the right to vote on staying in Europe.



But Mr Justice Paul Maguire dismissed this argument, pointing out that the Good Friday agreement was constitutionally relevant only “in the particular context of whether Northern Ireland should remain as part of the UK or unite with Ireland.”



Delivering his judgment in the high court on Friday morning, Mr Justice Maguire said the implications of Brexit for Northern Ireland were still unclear after the prime minister indicated she would start negotiations to leave the EU before March 2017.

“While the wind of change may be about to blow, the precise direction in which it will blow cannot yet be determined, so there is a level of uncertainty, as evidenced by the discussion about how the Northern Ireland land border with Ireland was affected by withdrawal from the EU,” he said.

Maguire said it was not in the court’s power to overturn a political decision but the judgment in Belfast would not prejudice other challenges to Brexit in English courts.

“It is the court’s view the prerogative power is still operative and can be used for the purpose of the executive giving notification for the purpose of article 50. This, however, is said without prejudice to the issues which have been stayed and which are under consideration in the English courts,” the judge said. “In respect of all issues, the court dismissed the applications.”

Among those who took the legal challenge to Brexit was Raymond McCord, whose son was murdered by loyalist paramilitaries. He had argued that Brexit would endanger the peace process and undermine the Good Friday agreement. 



After the judgment, McCord said he was disappointed, adding that he would take his case to the supreme court in London. ”We live in a democratic system,” he said. “56% of the people of this country voted to remain.”

A separate case to grant Northern Ireland the right to be exempt from Brexit was taken by a cross-party group of Stormont assembly members, including Sinn Fein’s former regional education minister John O’Dowd and the former justice minister David Ford.

A government spokesperson said: “We welcome the court’s judgment, which agrees with us that the government can proceed to trigger article 50 as planned.

“As we have always made clear, we stand by our commitments under the Belfast agreement and the outcome of the EU referendum doesn’t change this. We will now await the outcome of the parallel cases under consideration by the England and Wales high court before setting out our next steps.”

The Ulster Unionist party said the judgment in Belfast meant that “the days of Brexiteers and remainers are over”.

Stephen Aiken, an Ulster Unionist member of the Northern Ireland Assembly, said: “Whether people like it or not, the United Kingdom is leaving the European Union.

“What the people now need is a united front, battling for the best deal possible for Northern Ireland. We would appeal for everyone’s energy to now be dedicated to that cause.”

An employment tribunal in London will decide whether Uber drivers should be treated as workers with basic employment rights, in a case that could affect tens of thousands of other people working across the gig economy.

The test cases have been brought by the GMB union on behalf of two Uber drivers who argue that the cab-hailing firm is breaching the law by failing to provide them with basic employment rights. GMB says they must be paid the “national living wage”, have paid holidays and the entitlement to rest breaks.

Uber has 40,000 drivers in the UK who connect to people looking for a cab via a smartphone app. The US firm says the drivers are independent contractors who are self-employed and can choose where and when they work.

The GMB general secretary described Uber drivers as “bogusly self-employed” before the tribunal ruling, due at 2pm London time. “It is vitally important for everybody employed across the so-called gig economy,” Justin Bowden said.

“What GMB’s court case has argued is that Uber exercises a very high degree of control over those workers in that it very much tells them what to do, where to go,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.

“It controls their pay and it’s also able to exercise disciplinary actions over those. That is not consistent with somebody who is self-employed, it is absolutely consistent with somebody who is a worker.”



Bowden rejected the argument that Uber drivers should not be classed as workers because they can choose to switch off the app and not work. He said in reality drivers did not have much choice. “If you fail to pick up a certain number of journeys and you logged off the app for a period of time, you get put in the so-called ‘sin bin’.”

The test cases will determine the claims of 17 other Uber drivers – and could have far-reaching consequences for the UK’s growing army of self-employed individuals.

Maria Ludkin, GMB’s legal director, said: “This case represents the first proper legal review of whether jobs in this part of the so-called gig economy really represent a new paradigm of freedom and self-employment, or in fact are simply a new technology ploy to deny employed workers ordinary employment rights and a national minimum wage.

“In our view, Uber’s business model is underpinned by the shaky foundations of worker exploitation and tax avoidance, both of which end up being underwritten by the ordinary taxpayer.”

Denis O’Brien, the Irish media magnate with a Maxwellian penchant for litigation, has come up with a wonderful wheeze to aid his legal action against Ireland’s parliament

He wants the Dublin high court to accept opinions advanced by an expert in US constitutional law.

In a pre-trial application on Thursday, as reported by the Irish Times and by RTÉ, O’Brien has asked the judge to admit into evidence a 60-page report from Laurence Tribe, a professor at Harvard Law School.

It is O’Brien’s contention that statements made by TDs (MPs) in parliament about his banking affairs do not have absolute privilege.

His counsel, Michael Cush SC, argued that Tribe’s evidence about American law was relevant and that it would be “appropriate and helpful” to consider authorities from other jurisdictions.



But lawyers acting for the Dáil committee on procedure and privileges, and for the Irish state, countered that there was no provision under which the Irish courts can hear such evidence. Tribe’s evidence had no relevance to Irish constitutional law, they said.

One of them, Maurice Collins, said that if US law was deemed to be relevant then so too could precedent from several other countries and O’Brien’s case could turn into “a constitutional convention” if such evidence were admissible.

There is “simply no US authority that could be seen to bear directly on the issues in these proceedings”, he said.

The case follows statements made in the Dáil by Social Democrat TD Catherine Murphy and Sinn Féin TD Pearse Doherty about O’Brien’s banking affairs in May and June 2015 respectively.

O’Brien claims the statements breached his rights by forcing him to concede in the high court, in June 2015, a script which he sought to prevent the broadcaster, RTÉ, publishing.

The president of the high court, Mr Justice Peter Kelly, said he would give his decision at a later date.

He refused a previous application by Cush to have the action, fixed for hearing on 29 November, heard by three judges.

Political violence in Zimbabwe has increased dramatically in 2016, with record levels of assault, abduction and torture recorded as opposition to Robert Mugabe’s 36-year rule escalates.

Around 654 cases of political violence were recorded by a local NGO, the Counselling Services Unit (CSU), as of 21 October, compared to 476 cases in the whole of 2015.



The CSU found that assaults were overwhelmingly perpetrated by the state’s security forces – including police, military and the secretive Central Intelligence Organisation – while opposition supporters and civil society activists had been on the receiving end of the increasingly violent treatment.

One activist interviewed by the Guardian, Ostallos Gift Siziba, a student protest leader at the University of Zimbabwe, said he was abducted by state security agents in August and taken to the headquarters of Zanu-PF, the ruling party, where he was hung from the ceiling by his feet.

“It is at this time that I experienced brutal, callous and inhumane treatment,” he said. “I was tortured and assaulted with my feet hanging upwards and my head downwards as 21 youths and men exchanged chances to beat me until I passed out.”

Siziba said his interrogators demanded information about other human rights defenders, and claims at one point he was dangled over a large drum of sulphuric acid.

Siziba was then transferred to the Harare central police station, where the beatings continued. “At this instant I had lost a lot of blood and I was still bleeding. I was injured in almost all parts of my body. I was denied water, and the right to call my parents, a lawyer, or anyone. I received no treatment and had to become my own doctor,” he said.

Siziba’s experience tallies with testimonies from other victims, indicating that it is not just the frequency of political violence that is on the rise, but the severity too.

Others victims reported being injected with unknown substances during interrogations, kept in solitary confinement, and subjected to sexual threats.

Frances Lovemore, the director of the NGO, said the allegations of torture had become increasingly shocking.

“The injecting unknown substances during torture is of concern, as is the abduction of relatives of human rights defenders when the target cannot be found. The sheer force of the beatings by the police, resulting in long bone fractures and life-threatening soft tissue injuries, is reminiscent of the previous violent responses by the state and ruling party when opposition parties were deemed a threat to power,” Lovemore said.

Lovemore’s NGO provides medical and rehabilitation services to survivors of organised violence and torture in Zimbabwe. The statistics are a record of people who have sought medical and counselling assistance from the organisation, and therefore provide an indicative rather than complete picture of political violence in Zimbabwe. The real number of incidents of political violence is likely to be even higher.

Popular resistance to Mugabe, the 92-year-old president, has intensified this year before the presidential election scheduled for 2018. Opposition has been increased by a severe drought, which has left millions hungry, and a cash shortage that is disrupting businesses and has left the government struggling to pay wages. 



CSU’s statistics show that of the 654 incidents of political violence recorded, the vast majority occurred in Zimbabwe’s two largest cities, Harare (334 incidents) and Bulawayo (92), both of which have become centres for the recent wave of political opposition.

The CSU found that 45% of victims were of indeterminate political affiliation, and of those with clear links to the opposition movement, more than 52% were supporters of the official opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change-Tsvangirai (MDC-T).

Obert Gutu, MDC-T’s spokesperson, responded to the findings by saying the ruling Zanu-PF’s regime had “over the years routinely targeted MDC supporters for assault, torture and intimidation”.

He added: “We are the largest and most popular political party in Zimbabwe and the regime is acutely aware of the fact that we command massive support throughout the length and breath of Zimbabwe. Hence, the regime has always targeted our supporters for victimisation.”

Linda Masarira, a former National Railways employee turned independent political activist, also suffered at the hands of the Zimbabwean police. She was arrested on 6 July and charged with engaging in violent demonstrations, and spent 84 days in jail before being released on bail.

She says she experienced constant physical and psychological abuse while in detention, beginning on the day of her arrest.

“I was the only female person that had been arrested, made to sit between male people’s legs [on the prisoner transfer vehicle]. They were touching me all over. Police were poking me with baton sticks. They try to take away your dignity and self-esteem,” she said.

After leading a protest by prisoners against the poor conditions of the Chikurubi female prison, she was moved to the notorious Chikurubi maximum security facility, usually reserved for male prisoners. There she was kept in solitary confinement for 18 days, and forced to wear leg irons.

“These are some things I had to deal with. When you oppose the ruling party, you know you’re going to go through hell. I told myself all this, that I had to be strong. And it actually made me stronger. I thought: if they are doing this to me, then what I’m doing has an impact,” said Masarira.

The British and French governments were accused of breaching children’s human rights as up to 50 teenagers were abandoned by authorities in Calais and forced into an industrial estate near the cleared-out refugee camp to sleep in makeshift conditions.

The teenagers were lured out of the site of the camp in the afternoon with the promise of transport to a reception centre where they could be assessed for asylum or reunification with families in the UK.



However, after an hour no bus had arrived. Police units emerged in force with riot shields, teargas and taser guns and began to kettle the group, pressing them into a side street in an industrial estate. Some of the refugees were in tears as it appeared that they would be sleeping on the streets again.

The prospect of dozens of refugee children being stranded outside for a second night triggered a high-level protest from the British government and a demand that the children be provided with an immediate safe place to go.

The home secretary, Amber Rudd, spoke to her French counterpart, Bernard Cazeneuve, on Thursday afternoon, telling him that the children who remained in Calais had to be properly protected.

Liberal Democrat peer Baroness Sheehan, who was in Calais to witness the operation, said: “Children have rights to food, family, shelter and protection under the Convention on the Rights of the Child” – a UN treaty declaring that all children are “entitled to special care and assistance”. “Britain and France are signatories to this. They are flouting the law,” she said.

As darkness fell and the promised safe accommodation for the remaining unaccompanied minors failed to materialise, and following phone calls from Sheehan, French police allowed a group of over 70 teenagers and adults back into the smouldering camp, to take shelter in an abandoned, unheated school building.

They were guarded by independent volunteers. One, Alice Sturrock from Edinburgh, said: “I did not think at 22 I would be on fire patrol in a refugee camp. There is a fire burning over that side and there are CRS [French police] with rubber bullets on the other. How is this a safe haven for children?” she said.

“They are fed up, tired and sad. It is crazy that no provision has been made for them. They have been given no information all day,” Inca Sorrell, another volunteer who has worked with child refugees in Calais for the past year, said.

Sheehan had earlier said she could not believe what she was seeing, given that the French ambassador in London and and Home Office minister Baroness Williams had given assurances some weeks ago that the demolition of the site would not begin before all the children were safeguarded.



“This is so humiliating and undignified,” Sheehan said. “These children have literally been pushed from pillar to post. They have sat there obediently under the bridge for several hours and then they were kettled. Now the instruction is that these people must disperse. It is as if the authorities are trying to wish the problem away. But the longer the keep their heads in the sand and don’t offer a solution, the bigger the problem will be.”

An atmosphere of despair among charity workers was mirrored by the behaviour of the children, all aged approximately 14 to 17, some of whom huddled against the wall in blankets as the temperature plummeted.



One Afghan teenager, wrapped in a yellow and green sleeping bag, said: “Fuck France, Fuck Britain. You are racists.”



He was in tears as a French volunteer tried to console him by asking him not to be angry with aid workers. He retorted: “You didn’t have to sleep on the side of the road last night – you have documentation, you have money. Fuck France.”



Annie Gavrilescu, a volunteer with the charity Help Refugees, said there was no sign of any official assistance for the children. “The sous-préfet [highest-ranking local civil servant] has washed his hands of them. There is nowhere for them to go. Those kids have been there with volunteers and officials, all day, waiting for buses. They have been given nothing. They are just tired and hungry.”

Save the Children spokeswoman Dorothy Sang, whose organisation had helped persuade the children to leave the camp on a promise of fresh shelter and the start of a new life, said: “Yet again these children have been put in a dangerous position. Once again, the authorities have walked away and left the charities to look after them.”

No French or British officials were on the scene with the children, although there was safeguarding support from charities including Save the Children, Care4Calais, Refugee Youth Services, Médicins sans Frontières and Doctors of the World.

Michael Garcia Bochenek, who was on the scene for Human Rights Watch, said: “Children are entitled to care and protection, to food, shelter, clothing. In this case, the French and British government have known for days that there were large numbers of unaccompanied children in the camp, and they have stepped in with too little, too late.”

A Home Office spokesperson said that during her phone conversation with Cazeneuve, Rudd had “reaffirmed the UK’s commitment to working with the French to make sure all minors eligible to come to the UK continue to be transferred as quickly as possible” and stressed that “any child either not eligible or not in the secure area of the camp should be cared for and safeguarded by the French authorities”. 



Earlier in the day, French police detained a number of young people amid continuing chaos, as new fires erupted in sections of the Calais camp. Charities were told that police would arrest anyone remaining on the site on Thursday afternoon if they had not registered. Video footage emerged showing officers taking away four young people from the site as they queued for food. It was not clear why they had been removed or where they had been taken to.



Minors who had not had a chance to be registered were wandering around in the camp in a state of panic and confusion. Charities say there has been a stark absence of information for the remaining young people about their options; they estimate that there could be up to 150 unregistered children.

Earlier on Thursday, the head of the local prefecture said all unaccompanied children had been given shelter last night after the state-run container camp turned away teenagers because it was full. Fabienne Buccio said 1,500 children had been housed in the container camp, while another 68 were given shelter in a hangar that had been used for the now-closed processing centre.

But inside the camp some 50 children slept on a sandy ridge with bedding provided by Refugee Youth Service. Another 40 were sent to a makeshift school, while others were sent to the temporary church and the temporary mosque, bringing the total of official and unofficial unaccompanied children outside the container camp closer to 200.

The Home Office confirmed that a bus-load of Calais children arrived in Croydon on Thursday, with more expected in the coming days. French officials said a total of 234 minors had been resettled in the UK since 17 October.

Yvette Cooper, the chair of the Commons home affairs committee, condemned scenes of “utter chaos for children and teenagers” that were “putting them in serious danger”. She said she had been in touch again with Home Office ministers to urge them to put serious pressure on the French authorities to provide an immediate safe place for children to go.

The Labour peer Alf Dubs, whose amendment to the Immigration Act has forced the government to accept a number of vulnerable refugee children, described the situation in Calais as “disastrous”. “We argued that the children in Calais should be in a place of safety, but they are not. I don’t know who to blame,” he said.

Five of his 16 years were spent in a refugee camp in Darfur, but Hussein’s last five months have been spent in the Calais camp, where he hoped to obtain legal sanctuary somewhere.



When it came in the shape of the clearance operation, Hussein (not his real name) jumped at the chance to move on. The youngster is used to to a hard life but not inured to it, and told the Guardian that he still has hopes of getting back to school and becoming an engineer.



Despite his best efforts, and queuing before dawn on three successive days, Hussein said he never made it to the head of the line to be processed, and on Wednesday night became one of the estimated 200 unaccompanied children left to sleep rough. Now he faces a second night in the grass with temperatures dropping and despondency setting in.

However, the teenager says his life before was worse. He said that he walked through the desert for 10 days before he and his friend, also in Calais, got a lift to Libya and then on to Italy.



“It was very difficult in Zamzam,” he said, referring to one of the biggest refugee camps in Darfur. “It is very dangerous there.” He said he was racially abused when he was there, pointing to the colour of his dark skin.

Despite the poor conditions, the Calais camp had been a better place to be: “The Jungle is better than Zamzam. There is no war. There is no danger. You have freedom. They kill anybody in Zamzam – women, children. They don’t care.”



He hasn’t spoken to his mother since 2014, and doesn’t know if she is alive or dead.



But like many, Hussein is in despair as he finds himself facing a night of sleeping in makeshift conditions after being duped into a police kettling operation instead of being placed on a bus to a special reception centre for minors, as was promised to charities on Thursday morning.



“I slept on the ground last night. Me and my friends have been queuing for three days. I don’t want to go back [to Darfur]. If I go back, I die.”

Sameer (not his real name) had been living in Germany for the past 15 months, but took a chance and came to Calais on Wednesday after hearing that he might get a chance to come to the UK as part of the camp clearance programme.

The 17-year-old said he fled the Taliban in Afghanistan and crossed by foot and using people-smugglers to Turkey, Greece and on to Germany as part of the sea of refugees who migrated to Europe last summer. He added that he made the decision to go to France because he had “no future” where he was.

Speaking fluent English, Sameer said he wants to come to Britain because he can understand the language and can make a life for himself and a contribution to the country.

“The Germans wanted to send me back to Bulgaria, where I was fingerprinted under the Dublin regulation. But I don’t want to go back to Bulgaria. The police there beat me up and kept me in jail for 15 or 16 days. They kicked us and starved us and treated us like animals.

“I had a few friends in the Jungle and received news that people were going to get a chance to apply for asylum, so I thought I might be reassessed here and given a fresh chance away from Bulgaria.”

He had only been in the Jungle one night – the night that part of it was razed to the ground. “My expectations of Calais were so high. But the Jungle is so terrible,” said the teenager, who did not want his name or photograph published. “I never guessed there would be such a place. How can people live like that?” But he added: “Nothing can be worse than the experience I have had, the problems everyone has had. Nobody, if they had a choice, would live in the Jungle.”

He said he came from a “broad-minded family”, with a father who “supported our education”. But problems started when two of his brothers started working for the US embassy and USAid.



“The Taliban asked why they were working for these non-Muslim people. ‘You must bring them to us and we will kidnap them and in exchange force them to release the Taliban in jail.’ They say, why do you not join our party? But I don’t want to join that disgusting party – my father taught us to be broad-minded.”



“But in Europe, even, nobody wants to give me a chance. Even in Germany, where I have been for 15 months. It took them eight months to process me and then they said I had to go back to Bulgaria,” he said.

Police believe they have done enough to avert the government’s threat to pass new laws outlawing the abuse of stop and search powers, despite new figures showing that black people are six times more likely to be targeted by officers than white people.



The official figures show a big fall in police use of stop and search for all ethnic groups. While more than eight in 10 incidents still lead to no arrest, changes appear to have reduced the police time wasted and infringements on the rights of innocent people.

However, the power is being used more disproportionately against black people than white people and that disparity grew in the past year. A black person was six times more likely to be stopped and searched by police than a white person, up from four times more likely the year before.

The government has threatened to pass new laws if the police do not reform sufficiently, but the issue now is whether ministers view the progress as sufficient.

Adrian Hanstock, the national police lead on stop and search, told the Guardian that enough had been done. “I think we’ve started to demonstrate the changes that the government had asked for,” he said.

“Have we done enough to demonstrate commitment, the will to change and ability to change? Yes, I think we have, because the legislation would be being laid now, they would not have waited four years.”

During her time as home secretary, Theresa May castigated the police over the issue. A review on racial inequality in the justice system, which is being led by MP David Lammy and will report to the prime minister, is under way.

In 2015-16, the number of stops fell 28%, to 386,474, with 16% leading to an arrest, suggesting that officers are using the powers in a more focused way than in previous years.



However, people from black and minority ethnic (BME) groups as a whole were almost three times more likely to be stopped than white people.

The Home Office commentary accompanying the statistics pointed out that the Metropolitan police’s higher use of stop and search than any other force skewed the figures, because much of Britain’s BME population lives in London.

The Met stopped 18 out of every 1,000 people in their policing area, more than twice the England and Wales average of seven stops per 1,000.

“MPS [the Met] account for a large proportion (40%) of stops and searches in England and Wales. As the force has a considerably larger BME population than other parts of the county, data for MPS can skew the data at a national level when considering the ethnicity of those stopped,” the report said. 



The home secretary, Amber Rudd, said the disproportionate stops directed against black people were due to prejudice.

“While today’s statistics show that our stop and search reforms are working, with a continuing fall in the overall number of stops and the highest ever recorded arrest rate, it is completely unacceptable that you are six times more likely to be stopped and searched if you are black than if you are white,” she said.

“I am clear that, in a Britain that works for everyone, no one should be stopped on the basis of their race or ethnicity.”

The Home Office did not answer whether it believed police had achieved enough to lift the threat of legislation, but it did say the police inspectorate would examine forces next year on stop and search.



The Conservatives hope one byproduct of their words and actions on race and the criminal justice system will be an increase in their low share of the increasingly important BME vote.



Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary and one of Britain’s most senior black politicians, said: “BME people have long been disproportionately subjected to stop and search. There is no objection to evidence-based stops, but what inflames the relationship between the community and the police is the abuse of stop and search.

“It poisons relationships between young people in inner cities and the police. Unless you have a young male family member who is repeatedly stopped and searched, it is difficult to appreciate the damage it can do.

“Tensions between the community and police led to the riots of the 80s and were cited as a reason for more recent public disturbances.”

A spokesperson for Black Lives Matter UK said the latest figures showed the ineffectiveness of stop and search reform. “These stats show that the new ‘intelligence-led’ stop and searches are really just prejudice-led. This is institutional racism, not just bad apples. We want this power scrapped and police forces held properly accountable.”

Stafford Scott, the coordinator of Tottenham Rights, which challenges institutional racism, said this interpretation chimed with the experience of the young people he worked with in north London. “This is part of the power that police have used like a blunt instrument to contain and control our community,” he said.

Scott said the increase in stop and search disproportionality showed that police intelligence, the supposed basis for the use of stop and search in London, unfairly targeted black youths while letting suspects from other communities off the hook.

“In a borough like Haringey, where the Turkish gangs are, it’s only black kids that are on the Matrix [the Met’s gangs database]. [The police] say they are gangsters and then stop and search them all the time,” Scott said.

When he was a child, Adnan Siddiqui would take the longer route from his home to watch Crystal Palace play football. The short route would pass The Victory pub, from which racists would jeer at him. He smiles at the thought that this same pub is now a mosque, the Thornton Heath Islamic Centre. Not that the racism has vanished from the pubs of his part of south London. Last Christmas a young Muslim was out in the pubs collecting for an African clean water charity – “trying to show people that not all Muslim people are bloody Isis” – but that made no difference to the man who punched him to the ground, racially insulting him as he fell. It was one small incident among a great many. The monitoring group Tell Mama found a whopping 326% rise in hate crime directed at Muslims in 2015. And it’s getting worse.

Dr Siddiqui is now the local GP in the area he grew up. But what he’s better known for is setting up Cage Prisoners. One of the most widely disparaged of advocacy organisations, now simply called Cage, their aim is to support those impacted by the war on terror, documenting abuses and insisting that all should have equal access to the rule of law.

They began with a particular concern for those kidnapped by the US and taken to Guantánamo Bay; too innocent to be put before a court of law, allegedly too dangerous to release. And, given the nature of this work, Cage inevitably stand alongside a whole range of people, from those who are innocent and have been wrongly targeted to those who are much more dangerous. Of course, it is the job of the law to distinguish between the two. Which is why the rule of law must pertain – exactly what Cage argue for.

But in making this case they have been derided, including by David Cameron no less, as dangerous terrorist sympathisers. And yes, Cage advocates have said some silly things in the past, for instance that “Jihadi John” was “extremely gentle” before his radicalisation. They might even be right – evil can work into even the gentlest soul – but it was unwise. And yes, of course Cage condemn people like him too. But so nervous are some of the work they do that no UK bank is willing to provide them with an account. You can imagine how much HMRC loves the idea that Cage can only offer to pay their taxes in cash or gifted jewellery.

Margaret Thatcher once accused Amnesty International of being “IRA apologists” for challenging the extrajudicial killing by the SAS of three IRA members in Gibraltar in 1988. Cage are doing much the same thing as Amnesty, except in the even more febrile environment of the war on terror. And they are described in much the same way.

I meet Dr Siddiqui for a biryani next to the East London mosque. Because I’m carrying too many assumptions, his accent – a cross between public schoolboy and south Londoner – catches me by surprise. I inquire further. He went to Dulwich College, he explains – with Nigel Farage. “He was in the sixth form when I first arrived,” Siddiqui says. He tells me he recalls Farage using words he found racially offensive, adding, “and I remember the way he did it, gloating on each word”. I am shocked but not surprised by this. “Yes, and he’s a Palace fan too,” Siddiqui then quips, lightening the mood.

As Siddiqui leaves to say his prayers and I wander home, I recall A Man for All Seasons, Robert Bolt’s play about Thomas More’s trial for treason. There’s a character who argues that it would be OK to disregard any law if chasing down the devil. It’s the 16th-century equivalent to the view that it is OK to suspend the rule of law when chasing down terrorists. More replies: “Oh? And when the last law was down, and the devil turned round on you, where would you hide, the laws all being flat? … Yes, I’d give the Devil benefit of law, for my own safety’s sake!”

This is exactly why Cage are right to insist that the law must apply even to those that the press and public opinion regularly demonise. Indeed, even to the devil himself.

From the moment that Donald Trump denied, in a nationally televised presidential debate, that he had ever groped or kissed a woman without her permission, it was only a matter of time before Gloria Allred got involved.

An ambulance chaser to her critics, a righteous crusader to her admirers, the 75-year-old women’s rights attorney is never far when a scandal of this nature bursts into national view. No one knows this better than Allred herself. “I knew,” she said in a recent interview, “as soon as I heard those words – the denial in the debate – that women would start contacting me and want to come forward.”

Sure enough, Allred has, as of publication, introduced the world to three different women who accuse Trump of inappropriate sexual contact. Her involvement has placed Allred back in familiar territory: holding court at one of her trademark press conferences, surrounded by a phalanx of news crews.

Politics is her strong suit. Allred tanked Meg Whitman’s bid for California governor when she announced that Whitman’s former nanny would be suing for unpaid wages. And she fanned the flames engulfing Herman Cain’s presidential campaign when she introduced a woman who claimed that Cain once grabbed her head, forced it toward his crotch, and leered, “You want a job, right?”

But the California attorney has also pursued causes that have chagrined her fellow feminists. It was not so long ago that Allred’s press conferences starred Tiger Woods’ ex-girlfriend or a woman who had an online flirtation with Anthony Weiner. Allred proclaimed that Woods’ ex was “a victim because he broke her heart”.



“Some of her causes are incredibly worthy,” the writer Emily Bazelon told the New York Times. “But her way of going about it makes me cringe.”

I spoke with Allred this week about her supposed baggage, Trump’s accusers, the cultural shifts around rape and sexual assault and what young women may not understand about Hillary Rodham Clinton.

Our conversation took place in two, 15-minute bursts. “I just have so many people trying to contact me,” she said as she excused herself from our first conversation. “Basically, women about Trump. And I have to get back to them.” How many? “Many.”

Supposedly we’re in a moment where the culture and the media is much less suspicious of women who say they’ve been raped or assaulted or harassed in the workplace. Less suspicious of people like your clients.

Yes and no. Someone just sent me a rape case. And in that case, the jury, when they were discussing with the prosecutor afterwards why they voted the way they did on the case, some of the jurors, according to the prosecutors, said the fact that the woman said “no” was not enough.

If a woman does say “no,” why would that not be enough? I mean, if “no” is not enough to indicate a lack of consent, what does a woman have to do?

So where do you think some of this optimism comes from, this idea that it’s getting better?

Maybe it’s the old two steps forward, one step backwards? A step forward is some of the laws that have been passed in some states, what we call the yes-means-yes laws.

I’ve also been active on working to change the laws, now in three states, to eliminate the statute of limitations for the criminal prosecution of rape and sexual assault. To eliminate that arbitrary time period. That’s a step forward because it means that more women can have access to justice. But it’s no guarantee.

You’re a lawyer, but you said once that women “have to be heard in the court of public opinion as well as in the actual courts”. Is that –

In some cases. In some cases. Not all.

Tell me about that distinction.

I’m not always back there saying, yes, you must speak out! I do this case by case. We settle many, many cases confidentially. No one except the parties and the lawyers will ever know that there even was an allegation.



And the women accusing Trump – what goes into the decision to have those big, trademark press conferences?

Mr Trump’s own words. I won’t use the P-word, but he did. That, and then his denial. I knew, as soon as I heard those words, the denial in the debate, that women would start contacting me and want to come forward.

Actually, many women contacted me even prior to the release of the Access Hollywood tape. They just wanted me to know what Mr Trump had done.

The accusations being made in these press conferences become news almost instantaneously. How is your office vetting these claims before you make them public?

We have spoken to individuals who are potential witnesses, who corroborate that at approximately the time or at some point after the incident occurred, not too long thereafter, they actually told one or more people about what happened.

Your critics see you as a serial attention-seeker. And that jibes with Trump’s claim – and this is how a lot of people dismiss claims of assault – that these women are lying for their “10 minutes of fame”. Do you think your involvement with these stories could be seen as compromising?

It’s hard to think of anyone who wants more fame than Mr Trump.

But I don’t call him an attention-seeker. I just call him a bully. Having said that, some of the women who came out before I did a press conference, they’ve been labelled all kinds of things by Trump supporters. As Mr Trump said early on in his campaign, he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and his supporters would still support him.

This is something that Emily Bazelon said about you, I believe around the time that you were hosting press conferences with Tiger Woods’ ex-girlfriends, who weren’t, to my memory, accusing him of a crime: “Some of her causes are incredibly worthy, but her way of going about it makes me cringe.” Why do you think you make this other feminist cringe?

I don’t know who Emily Bazelon is. You would have to ask her what things in life make her cringe. We’d be in a guessing game about what she means when she says “her way of going about it”.

There are some people who would prefer that victims suffer in silence. I’m not one of them. We’re lawyers. We don’t take polls or votes to see what other feminists believe is right.

OK, but people at the time had this criticism that you were giving an equal platform to women with broken hearts and women alleging an actual crime.

Our standard is not: should women only have a voice if they’re the victim of a crime? I don’t know who thinks that that’s the standard, that women can only speak out if there’s a crime. I’ve never heard that as a requirement.

You’re a big Clinton supporter. Do you notice a generational divide among women in how excited they are to see the first woman elected president, potentially?

I’m not a pollster. I will say this: I think that there are many women, older women, who really understand how important it is that we have a woman president.

Four years from now, and I think of this often, it will be 2020. And Hillary Rodham Clinton – if, as, and when she’s elected in November – will still be president. And in that year we will mark the 100th anniversary of women’s winning the right to vote in the United States.

That will be so important. And yes, I believe that we do, as mothers, as grandmothers, understand the importance of having a woman in the White House. Not only for the purposes of what I’ll call herstory, but as an inspiration for our daughters. And it’s just long overdue.

Is “herstory” really your preferred word for history?

Now it is. If she wins, she really is going to be making herstory.

You referred to Hillary Clinton as Hillary Rodham Clinton. Which I love, I don’t see many people referring to her using her maiden name. Is that a conscious choice?

Yes. At some point when she was in Arkansas, after she got married, she added her married name. She’s chosen to keep both names. And I’m glad she did. She’s saying, consider me on my own merits.

I went to an all-girls high school, and many of these girls went on to be accomplished leaders and very successful. When it’s time for a reunion, it’s difficult to find some of these girls, because some of them have shed the only name we knew them by.

A colleague of mine keeps saying she’s surprised no one is selling shirts that just read “Hillary Rodham”.

Yes! I like it. Listen, part of why I admire her is because I have a small sense of what she’s endured. She has taken all of this criticism. That’s the price you pay for standing up for women’s rights, which is a statement by itself. Her election will be a message to our daughters: yYou too can overcome. I think this is herstoric and I’m so excited.

I’m sorry, did you say herstoric or historic?

The Obama presidency unleashed in many ways a racist backlash. Do you think a Hillary Clinton presidency could have the potential to do the same for sexism?

There are some people who think that women should be denied opportunities because of their gender. But I think she’s going to show, through deeds, not just words, what a president can be. For many of the misogynists and male chauvinists out there, just experiencing a woman in power hopefully will help to eliminate some of those stereotypes.

There will still be some who will cling to the gender stereotypes and traditional gender roles. But this is it. We’re moving ahead. I’ve already made my reservations for the inauguration. I made them back in July.



This Q & A is the product of two phone calls and has been edited and condensed.

Bear with me on this. I have to get through a little bit of recent history before I reach the point. I’m going to risk the devil-in-the-detail cliché because it is so apt.

For the last couple of weeks, several newspapers have been getting into a lather about the possible triggering of section 40 of the crime and courts act.

Editorial writers and columnists decried it as a threat to press freedom. It is, said the Daily Telegraph, “a pernicious measure that would see libel costs awarded against any newspaper which is not a member of a government-approved regulator”.

It would mean that even if a paper won a legal action, successfully defending itself against a claim, it would have to pay the claimant’s costs.

The Daily Mail called it “an appalling piece of legislation”. The Times argued that it sought “to corral independent news organisations into a form of state-backed regulation that is itself inimical to freedom of expression”.

In company with most newspapers, it was sticking by the regulator set up by publishers, the Independent Press Standards Organisation (Ipso), which has refused to seek official recognition under the royal charter created in the wake of the Leveson inquiry.

I know this is tough going but please don’t go. A hugely significant story will emerge.

On Tuesday, matters seemed to change. According to a front page news story in the Times (and another in the Sun), the government was not, after all, contemplating the introduction of the feared section 40. Citing “Westminster sources”, the article stated that the provision “will not go ahead”.

It also reported, as did others, comments by the culture secretary Karen Bradley when giving evidence to the commons culture, media and sport select committee.

She told MPs: “I have had representations from local editors extremely concerned about section 40”. And she also said: “I have made no decision on the timing of a decision on section 40. I don’t rule it out at some point in the future.”

The Times reported that its sources interpreted this statement to mean that she would not implement the clause.

So it was a case of problem over then? Evidently not, because - forgive me again - I have to go back, to 11 October, and this time to the House of Lords.

On that day, four peers - led by Baroness (Sheila) Hollins, a crossbencher - tabled amendments to the investigatory powers bill aimed at bringing in section 40 by a new route (pejoratively, the back door). It would have the effect of making newspapers pay costs for both parties in phone-hacking claims.

Hollins’s intention was explicit in her speech. She said there had not been an explanation from the former culture secretary, John Whittingdale, about his refusal to introduce section 40.



“That represents a change of government policy”, she said, “which both breaks the cross-party agreement and betrays promises made to both houses and to press abuse victims”.

The amendments were carried by 282 votes to 180 (thereby making history as the first government defeat since Theresa May became prime minister).

Now the bill will have a formal third reading in the Lords on Monday (31 October) before being debated the following day in the Commons.

It is therefore theoretically possible that section 40, or some version of it, could pass into law. It is uncertain whether the government will be able to whip all Tory MPs into line.

Now, finally, here’s the disturbing implication should the amendment be passed...

Imagine this scenario. A person who makes a legal complaint about a story argues that the details could only have been obtained by a journalist hacking into his/her phone.

The editor, inevitably, would seek to protect the reporter’s source. In so doing, however, it would be impossible to prove whether hacking was or was not involved.

In the ensuing legal action, under the section 40 provision, the newspaper’s publisher would be liable for the costs of the claimant as well as its own. It could prove commercially disastrous for some publishers.



It would affect all newspapers that are not regulated by an approved regulator, which means all those titles currently with Ipso (ie, the vast majority) plus the many outside (such as the Guardian, Financial Times, London Evening Standard and Private Eye).

There’s a second important point to note as well. From the moment it was first mooted that press regulation should be carried out under the auspices of a royal charter it was argued that it gave parliament too great an opportunity to restrict press freedom.

It was argued that the terms of the charter could be tinkered with at some future stage. This was pooh-poohed at the time as being far-fetched.

Now, with the inappropriate use of the investigatory powers bill to introduce section 40 by sleight of hand, it has come to pass. And it surely does threaten the freedom of the press.

However much one sympathises with people who have suffered at the hands of the press, and however much I lack sympathy for newspapers guilty of all manner of bad behaviour, I cannot but see section 40 as a retrograde step.

The Ministry of Justice has explicitly acknowledged that staff cuts are a factor in the rising tide of violence in prisons in England and Wales.

The latest figures show that self-inflicted deaths inside jails rose 13% to a record 107 in the 12 months to September, and assaults behind bars increased by more than 34% to 23,775 – about 65 per day – in the 12 months to the end of June 2016. Incidents of self-harm, another key indicator of prison safety, rose by 26% to 36,400 reported incidents in the year to June.

The MoJ figures show an increasingly volatile situation in women’s prisons, with the number of self-inflicted deaths doubling from four to eight in the past 12 months and assaults rising by 25% in a year.

“The rise in assaults since 2012 has coincided with major changes to the regime, operating arrangements and culture in public sector prisons,” says an MoJ commentary on the prison safety figures published on Thursday. “For example, restructuring of the prison estate, including staff reductions, which have reduced overall running costs, and an increase in gang culture and illicit psychoactive drugs in prisons.

“As well as the dangers to both physical and mental health, trading in these illicit drugs can lead to debt, violence and intimidation.”

The justice secretary, Elizabeth Truss, said the figures demonstrated the gravity of the problem of violence and self-harm in prisons. “The consequences are devastating and go far beyond the confines of the prison walls, spilling out into our streets and communities,” she said.

“Prison reform is my top priority. I am committed to making prisons places of safety and reform, where our dedicated officers are given the support they need to help offenders turn their lives around. That is why I have invested an initial £14m at 10 of our most challenging prisons, and shortly I will be publishing a white paper outlining the much-needed reform across the prison estate to 2020 and beyond.”

Mark Day, of the Prison Reform Trust, said the figures revealed “a hidden emergency unfolding in our prison system”. He said the rise in prison violence over the last three years could not be allowed to become the new normal.

“The government’s forthcoming prison safety and reform plan must get to grips with a dangerously deteriorating situation. The lives of people who live and work in prison depend on it,” he said.

Frances Crook, of the Howard League for Penal Reform, said: “Cutting staff and prison budgets while allowing the number of people behind bars to grow unchecked has created a toxic mix of violence, death and human misery … Today’s figures show that we cannot wait for legislation – bold and radical action is needed now to stop the death toll rising further.”

The claim that the international criminal court unfairly targets Africans is gaining significant traction after the Gambia became the third country on the continent to announce its withdrawal from the Hague-based tribunal.

The move follows similar announcements from Burundi and South Africa, who informed the UN secretary-general, Ban Ki-moon, of their decision to quit the court last week, making them the first countries to begin the year-long exit process in the court’s 18-year history.

Burundi’s parliament has claimed the court is merely “a political tool used by [foreign] powers to remove whoever they want from power on the African continent”.

The ICC had said in April it would investigate outbreaks of violence in Burundi, which has been mired in a political crisis for more than a year.

South Africa announced it would be leaving the court on similar grounds, arguing that the ICC’s Rome statutes were at odds with its own laws granting leaders diplomatic immunity.

There have been a number of complaints that the ICC is biased, and some politicians have denouncing the tribunal as an instrument of colonial justice.

Of the 10 cases being investigated by the court, nine involve African countries, including all three trials. So far, ICC arrest warrants have only ever been issued for Africans.

While there may be sound reasons for this – five African countries have referred themselves to the court, for example, and 33 African states have ratified the Rome statute that established the ICC, making Africa the largest continental bloc – the perception that it targets Africans exclusively has left the court vulnerable.

As a result, the court is facing what appears to be a coordinated revolt that risks destroying its legitimacy.

Among political analysts there is little doubt that more African countries will announce their intention to withdraw in the next few weeks, with Chad, Kenya and Namibia all likely candidates.

Allan Ngari, researcher at the Institute for Security Studies, said the announcements “must be part of a plan”, particularly the latest move by the Gambia.

“That Fatou Bensouda, the chief prosecutor of the international criminal court, is from the very state that has made the most recent withdrawal can only speak of a deliberate effort to hurt the court, particularly the organ which has had the most interface with African states, which is the office of the prosecutor,” said Ngari.

Bensouda, a Gambian citizen, took on the court’s leading job in 2012, and it was hoped by some that her nationality would assuage some of the court’s African critics.

But this week her country’s government resounding rejected the court. “The ICC, despite being called international criminal court, is in fact an international Caucasian court for the persecution and humiliation of people of colour, especially Africans,” said Sheriff Bojang, the Gambia’s information minister.

So what now for the ICC? Kelly-Jo Bluen, an expert at the Institute for Justice and Reconciliation, said the withdrawals would be a blow for the ICC, but suggested a mass African exodus was unlikely.

“I imagine we will see further withdrawals, but I am not convinced by the idea that there will be an Africa-wide withdrawal. Some states will remain ICC members because of ongoing support for the court, while other states view the court as a useful tool in maligning opposition domestically,” she said.

Some African countries, most notably Botswana, have not joined in the chorus of anti-ICC sentiment. In a statement released on Wednesday, the government reiterated its support for the tribunal.

“Botswana is convinced that as the only permanent international criminal tribunal, the ICC is an important unique institution in the international criminal justice system. Botswana therefore wishes to reaffirm its membership of the Rome statute and reiterate its support for a strong international criminal justice system through the ICC,” the statement read.

Senegal has declined to take an official position, but its justice minister, Sidiki Kaba, who also happens to be the current president of the assembly of state parties to the Rome statute of the international criminal court, has urged South Africa and Burundi to reconsider their positions.

So while it may be wounded, the ICC is not dead in Africa – not yet. The anti-ICC brigade is strong and growing, but it does not yet enjoy complete continent-wide support.

The law could be reformed to make clear that an alleged rape victim’s sexual history must not in future be used routinely as evidence in court, the attorney general has suggested.

Jeremy Wright told the House of Commons that concerns about the practice were legitimate, after a group of MPs warned that women would be less likely to report rape because of the high-profile retrial of the footballer Ched Evans.

More than 40 female Labour MPs wrote to Wright expressing their worries after evidence about the sexual history of the complainant was used in the retrial of Evans, a former Wales international who was acquitted this month.

Evans was found not guilty of raping a 19-year-old woman following a five-year battle to clear his name. The jury at Cardiff crown court heard from two men who had sex with the complainant around the time of the rape allegation. Such evidence is only allowed in rape trials in exceptional circumstances.

Following the case, members of the women’s parliamentary Labour party, including its chair, Jess Phillips, as well as Harriet Harman and Angela Eagle, urged the government to support a change in the law to prevent the sexual history of rape complainants being used routinely to discredit their evidence in court.

Section 41 of the Youth and Criminal Evidence Act 1999 puts restrictions on what evidence can be put before a court by the defence about an alleged victim’s sexual behaviour, and on the questioning of the complainant. However, a loophole means previous sexual behaviour can be used only in matters of consent “when the behaviour is close to the time of the alleged offence and the behaviour is so similar as to not be explained by coincidence”, according to the CPS.

In the letter to Wright, the MPs wrote that a move towards revisiting the sexual history of complainants in court would “act to make the prosecution of rape cases in the future harder and reporting of these crimes less likely”.

Vera Baird, a former solicitor general, said the Evans case put Britain back “probably about 30 years” in relation to women reporting rape to the police. 



Speaking in the House of Commons, Wright said the subject was a matter of concern and suggested that the law and guidance around the admission of a complainant’s sexual history in criminal trials could be reformed.

“There is concern here, and we need to accept that that concern is sensible and deal with it,” he said.

“I think what we need to look at is a number of things. We need to understand more about the decision in this particular case, we need to understand whether a change in the law is appropriate and, if not, whether it is sensible to look at the guidance that is given to judges about when this evidence is admissible and the guidance that judges give to juries about how that evidence should be used.

“I think we need to do all of those things before we are in a position to understand what, if any, changes are needed.” 



Wright said the legal provision allowing an alleged victim’s sexual history to be used in evidence was not used routinely.

However, he added: “We must be confident that the message sent to those who may be currently worried about reporting these sorts of offences is not that they are not encouraged to do so, quite the reverse: they are, and we need to make sure that those messages are clear.”

The matter was raised by the shadow solicitor general, Nick Thomas-Symonds, who said there were “grave recent concerns about the admissibility of a complainant’s previous sexual history in rape trials”.

He warned that “single high-profile cases can give rise to wider perceptions about the law” and urged ministers to ensure victims were encouraged to come forward.

In many ways I was the stereotype of a troublesome teenager. I used to spend most of my weekends drinking heavily – sometimes in bars or nightclubs, if I managed to blag my way past the bouncers and could afford it, but more often as part of a group of 20 or 30 kids hanging around in a local park. Illegal drugs like cannabis were fairly common.

As is fairly typical of unsupervised, intoxicated teenagers, people would often end up doing stupid things in an attempt to impress their mates. I remember someone breaking into a crown green bowling clubhouse and nicking all the trophies. Another time, a couple of boys ran down the street picking up and smashing plant pots as they went. Inspired, I think, by an episode of The Simpsons, stealing car hood ornaments was briefly a popular activity. I might not have been an instigator, but I wasn’t always an innocent bystander either.

Our misbehaviour might have been fairly trivial, but it was still antisocial and reckless. I could have been arrested on dozens of occasions, but my contact with the police was fairly minimal. They sometimes showed up at house parties after neighbours complained about noise and told us to quieten down or go home. Very rarely do I remember anyone being searched for drugs.

At the time, I might have put this down to luck. Looking back it seems likely there were other factors at play. It mattered that most of this took place in some of the more affluent postcodes of Sheffield, and that the majority of the kids involved were from so-called “good families” – well-spoken and not previously known to the police. Almost certainly, it mattered that most of us were white.

Not all communities are policed in the same way. The place you live, the way you look and even your accent affect whether you’re likely to be identified as potentially criminal. Stop-and-search powers are used much more frequently with certain social groups. As Inspector Nick Glynn, vice president of the National Black Police Association, notes: “If you aren’t well off – if you’re young, from an urban area, black, or Asian – your chances of getting stopped by the police for drugs are much higher.” Police rarely bothered anyone where I grew up unless they were called to investigate a specific complaint.

Even when caught committing a criminal offence, people are treated differently depending on their background. Researchers at the LSE found that, in London, people from the highest socioeconomic class – doctors, lawyers, journalists – were three times more likely to be let off with a caution for drug offences than people who were unemployed. Evidence suggests that experimenting with illegal drugs is roughly equal across the socioeconomic spectrum, and regular drug use more common among young people, but the vast majority of those in prison for drug offences are not from middle-class backgrounds.

A new report by the commons justice committee has called for offenders aged 18-25 to be treated with more leniency, as “temperance – the ability to evaluate the consequences of actions and to limit impulsiveness and risk-taking” is still developing at that age. What it doesn’t acknowledge is that some young people are already afforded that benefit of the doubt.

The more privileged your class background, the more likely it is that criminal behaviour at this age will be construed as a “mistake” – the product of youthful high spirits and something you’ll inevitably grow out of in time. Mostly, this seems to be an accurate assumption. However, the justice committee report notes that incarcerating young people increases the likelihood they’ll enter into a cycle of offending. Labelling people as criminal is often a self-fulfilling prophecy.

It’s abundantly clear that the rules aren’t the same for everyone. At one extreme you’ve got Bullingdon Club members, infamous for committing criminal damage and other offences with impunity, shielded from any consequence by their money, connections and visible poshness. At the other, predominately working-class young people stuck with injunctions for “drunken behaviour” and “playing loud music at night”. These injunctions, which replaced Asbos, are given to children as young as 10, and recipients over the age of 18 risk being incarcerated for up to five years if they defy directives by doing things like “going to [their] local town centre” or “spending time with people who are known as trouble-makers”.

In recommending that more effort is made to keep 18-25s out of prison, the justice committee’s report effectively suggests that the leniency already afforded to comparatively privileged young people is extended across the class spectrum. So that kids from city centre council estates can behave as stupidly as say, Boris Johnson in his younger years, without it ruining their life.

It’s a welcome, common-sense intervention, but tackling class and racial bias in UK police practice is likely to require a more sustained effort to promote cultural change. I was allowed to make mistakes when I was young – now all of us that were so fortunate have a duty to speak out in an effort to end this unfairness.

I am delighted that Anthony France won his appeal against his conviction for aiding and abetting a police officer to commit misconduct in a public office.

It was something of a foregone conclusion, with all his colleagues having rightly been cleared. But the fact of it is a relief for him and a further blow to the credibility of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and the Metropolitan police.



Operation Elveden, the police investigation into payments to police and public officials, can now be seen as a very expensive failure, and it caused long-lasting hurt.

Several of the prosecuted Sun journalists suffered terribly during the years of police bail when they were unable to work and believed their careers were at an end, as happened in some cases.

France’s reaction to the appeal court decision, in which spoke of a “serious miscarriage of justice” and enduring “1,379 days of sheer hell”, was anything but an exaggeration. Plenty of his colleagues felt the same way. 



France, the Sun’s crime reporter, should never have been convicted. When the jury found against him in July 2015, I detected that the judge, Timothy Pontius, may have been somewhat sympathetic.



When sentencing France to an 18-month suspended jail term, he described him as a journalist of “hitherto unblemished character” who was “essentially a decent man of solid integrity”.

But let us not forget that Elveden resulted in several people who acted as journalists’ sources being convicted and jailed.

The documentary evidence against them was provided to the police by News International (now News UK) on Rupert Murdoch’s orders.



Moreover, the publisher had sanctioned the system of payments by its journalists to those sources. Yet there was no corporate prosecution.

The poor bloody infantry went down to face the guns while the generals remained untouched in their Wapping (now London Bridge) command post.

Two Yazidi women who survived sexual enslavement by Islamic State before escaping and becoming “inspirational” advocates for their community in Iraq have won the EU’s prestigious Sakharov human rights prize.



Nadia Murad and Lamiya Aji Bashar were abducted with other Yazidi women in August 2014 when their home village of Kocho in Sinjar, northern Iraq, was attacked by Isis jihadis. It was one of the darkest episodes Iraq has suffered at the hands of the terrorist group.

The annual Sakharov prize for freedom of thought, established in 1988, is named after the Soviet physicist and outspoken dissident Andrei Sakharov and is awarded to “individuals who have made an exceptional contribution to the fight for human rights across the globe”. It has previously been awarded to the likes of Aung San Suu Kyi and Nelson Mandela. 



The EU described Murad and Aji Bashar as “public advocates for the Yazidi community in Iraq, a religious minority that has been the subject of a genocidal campaign by IS militants”. 



Guy Verhofstadt, the leader of the European parliament’s liberal ALDE group, said the pair were “inspirational women who have shown incredible bravery and humanity in the face of despicable brutality”.

The EU’s prize will again put a spotlight on the plight of Yazidis, some of whom are still held in Isis captivity. Although some have been rescued, the majority of those taken by Isis are still being held, with about 3,600 mostly women and children missing.

Hundreds were thought to be captive in Mosul, but activists and their families fear Isis will transport them to Syria as a broad coalition of anti-Isis forces pushes towards the group’s main Iraqi stronghold.

News of the prize came as fighting continued on the ground in Iraq, with the army – on the 11th day of a ground offensive to recapture Mosul – inching closer to the city.

Last year the Sakharov prize was awarded to Raif Badawi, the Saudi blogger and activist sentenced to 10 years in prison and 1,000 lashes for insulting Islam. In 2012 the award was shared by two Iranians, human rights lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh and celebrated film-maker Jafar Panahi, leading to Sotoudeh’s release from prison. 



Among the 2016 finalists were the Turkish journalist Can Dündar and the Crimean Tatar leader Mustafa Dzemilev.

Murad, who won the Council of Europe’s Václav Havel human rights prize earlier this month, was captured in 2014 alongside her sisters, and lost six brothers and her mother as Isis jihadis killed the village’s men and any women considered too old to be sexually exploited.

A family helped her to escape and she went to Germany. A year later she addressed the UN security council and became the goodwill ambassador for the UN office on drugs and crime.

Aji Bashar, whose brother and father were killed by Isis, was used as a sex slave by the militants and forced to make bombs and suicide vests.

“Aji Bashar tried to flee several times before finally escaping in April with the help of her family, who paid local smugglers,” an EU statement said. She eventually went to Germany, where she received medical care and joined her surviving siblings.

“Since her recovery Aji Bashar has been active in raising awareness of the plight of the Yazidi community and continues to help women and children who were victims of IS enslavement and atrocities.”

Those who have escaped mostly did so with the help of Yazidi smugglers and a local “underground railway”, and Yazidis resent the lack of support from the international community and fellow Iraqis.

More than two years after the genocidal Isis attacks on their homeland, hundreds of thousands are still living in refugee camps because they fear it is not safe to return home, even to villages that have been freed from Isis control. Many of the villages are still in ruins, with few services.

Yazda, an NGO that supports the Yazidi community in Iraq, congratulated Murad and Aji Bashar on their award and urged the west not to ignore the plight of Yazidis still in captivity.

“This occasion is a meaningful moment for the Yazidi community worldwide to celebrate,” it said. “However, Yazda sincerely hopes that in addition to this substantial acknowledgment of Nadia and Lamiya’s work, the international community will turn more attention to the thousands of Yazidi women and children still in captivity, the thousands of Yazidi men whose whereabouts remain unknown to their families, and to the hundreds of thousands of Yazidis who remain displaced in Iraq and elsewhere and are unable to return to their homelands and begin rebuilding their lives.”

Khider Domle, an academic and activist based in Dohuk, said: “It’s another major recognition for them to get this kind of prize. As activists and members of the Yazidi community, we really welcome this. It will help our cause to be more recognised in the world.”

On Thursday the US said up to 900 Isis jihadis had been killed in the offensive to retake Mosul, as camps around the city filled with fleeing civilians.

In an area close to the town of Hammam al-Alil, to the south of Mosul, Isis fighters resisted by using snipers and suicide bombings, and were reported to have carried out a mass execution in the city to deter citizens from aiding the US-led offensive.

Iraqi special forces said Isis resistance had been cleared from the east of Mosul and that the focus was now on the south.

It is not clear how long it will take the coalition to oust Isis from Mosul, in what is the biggest ground offensive in Iraq since the US invasion in 2003. 



The US secretary of defence, Ashton Carter, has said the campaign will soon broaden to Syria, where plans are under way for a similar offensive against Isis jihadis in Raqqa, the de facto capital of the group.

Indigenous leaders have cautiously welcomed plans for a fresh inquiry into the high rates of Indigenous incarceration, providing it delivers tangible changes in government policy.

George Brandis, the attorney general, announced on Thursday that he would ask the Australian Law Reform Commission to investigate the issue, saying the overrepresentation of Indigenous people in the justice system was a “national tragedy” and a poor reflection on Australian society.



In a speech to the Australian Bar Association in Melbourne, Brandis said the doubling of incarceration rates since the royal commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody showed attempts by successive governments to address the issue had failed.

“Those statistics of course paint a stark picture – a picture of failed initiatives and flawed or incomplete reform efforts which, despite the best intentions, often deliver little by way of tangible progress and indeed, as those statistics reveal, we have gone backwards,” Brandis said.

The inquiry would focus on legal reform to address the overrepresentation of Indigenous people in the justice system, with the terms of reference to be set in consultation with Indigenous organisations.

Western Australian Labor senator Pat Dodson, a Yawuru man who was on the 1988-91 royal commission, said any fresh inquiry would have to be accompanied by real action to combat the cynicism felt by many in the Indigenous community who had seen inquiry after inquiry pass without change.

“In this case at least they’ve done something,” he said. “The effectiveness of it has yet to be seen, of course.”

The inquiry was announced a week after Dodson criticised the Indigenous affairs minister, Nigel Scullion, for “amnesia” over past inquiries into Indigenous incarceration.

The royal commission in particular produced 339 recommendations, very few of which have been enacted.

“[Scullion] may have peered through the window into the morass in front of him and got a bit of a fright,” Dodson told Guardian Australia on Thursday. “I am not confident that there is a real sense of zeal about this.”

Rates of Indigenous imprisonment have doubled in the 25 years since the royal commission, from 14% of the prison population in 1991 to 27% in 2015.



Indigenous adults are 15 times more likely to be jailed than non-Indigenous adults, Indigenous women are 30 times more likely, and Indigenous children are 26 times more likely.

Dodson said any new inquiry should include an examination of the extent to which current social policy addresses the underlying causes of disadvantage which contribute to incarceration rates.



Reforms like scrapping mandatory sentencing laws in WA or paperless arrest laws in the Northern Territory would reduce incarceration, he said, but are outside of federal government control.

“The social policy settings are as crucial as any reform to the legal situation, and that’s something the federal government does control,” he said.

WA senator Rachel Siewert said she had “no confidence” another inquiry would reduce Indigenous incarceration rates, which are growing by 7% a year.

“There’s been report after report but little action,” she said. “It’s astounding that they are so out of touch that they think this is a good idea.”

Siewert sat on the most recent parliamentary inquiry into Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander experiences of law enforcement and justice, which handed down its final, largely ignored report this month.

It produced 11 recommendations, including ensuring the federal government adequately funded Indigenous legal services, operating justice reinvestment trial sites in every state and territory, and asking the Council of Australian Governments (Coag) to review the effect of mandatory sentencing laws on Indigenous Australians.

It was the sixth federal government report on Indigenous incarceration in the past seven years.

There was the Senate access to justice inquiry in 2009 (31 recommendations), the lower house inquiry into Indigenous youth experiences with the criminal justice system in 2011 (40 recommendations), a lower house inquiry in 2012 into the prevention and diagnosis of foetal alcohol spectrum disorders (19 recommendations), the Senate inquiry into justice reinvestment in 2013 (nine recommendations), and the productivity commission report on access to justice in 2014 (83 recommendations).

Shane Duffy, co-chair of Change the Record, echoed Dodson’s call for a focus on social policies over law reform.

He said the federal government would achieve more by leveraging funding it provides under national partnership agreements for the Close the Gap program to force states and territories to address issues such as inequality, poor education, poor health and unemployment.

“It’s all very well to talk about imprisonment to employment,” Duffy said. “But if I’m in jail and I’m released, in many situations I’m sick, I’m not well educated and I have got nowhere to live. So then I’m homeless and unemployed.”

Duffy, a Kalkadoon man, said that in those circumstances most people would return to jail.

He had no option but to remain hopeful that Indigenous incarceration rates could be reduced.



“There has got to come a time when Australian politicians, regardless of what political party you are from, realise that this isn’t working,” he said.

Roxanne More, a Noongar woman and Indigenous rights spokeswoman for Amnesty Australia, said the inquiry could be useful if it focused on the racism and discrimination Indigenous Australians faced in the justice system.

“We have had many reports and inquiries that have made recommendations about Indigenous incarceration ... but we also have to talk about systemic factors that contribute to that,” Moore said.

Indigenous incarceration was a complex problem, but she said: “It’s one that we have known the answers to for a long time, and now we have got a momentum and, it seems, a will to change it at a national level.”

Victims raped by strangers will have their identities protected from their attackers under a move to change the law on sexual assaults. 



Campaigners claim victims of serious sexual crimes by strangers are frequently put in unnecessary danger by police officers disclosing the name of the accuser to the accused.

The draft amendment to the policing and crime bill, which is now before the House of Lords, would apply to stranger rape cases where there is currently no legislation on how and when a victim’s name is given to the accused by police.

One victim has told the Guardian that the manner in which the police disclosed her identity was “the most extreme and lasting violation” of the sexual violence she suffered.

The move comes at the same time as concern for victim’s rights mounts following the retrial of the footballer Ched Evans, who was acquitted of rape. The sexual history of Evans’s accuser was submitted as evidence during the retrial.

“There is no specific policy or legislation which covers the issue of providing the name of a victim of rape to the suspect,” Neil Smith of the Metropolitan police sexual offences, exploitation and child abuse command said. “Instead, it is an operational decision taken by the officer in the case on a case-by-case basis.”

As the proportion of rapes committed by strangers is small – one in 10 according to Rape Crisis – campaigners say measures should cover all sexual assault cases to protect victims.

The proposals could be challenged on the basis that they contravene a defendant’s right to know who is accusing them, a key legal principle. Yet campaigners argue that a defendant could still identify their accuser by photographs and other details that do not include their name.

At present, police protocol allows officers to give a victim’s name to a suspect, often at the very beginning of an investigation at the point of arrest, and before it is known if a case will go to court. It has been argued this information allows an alleged assailant to subsequently discover where the victim lives and works.

One woman, who was followed by a man in 2014 who attempted to rape her in a bush before being caught at the scene by off-duty police, said that when she heard her name had been given to the man on the same night as the attack, she initially thought it was a mistake.



“[The police] read me the charge and it had his name in it. I said that I didn’t want to know his name, and thank God he didn’t get to know mine,” said the woman, named only as Melanie H.

Officers then told her he already knew her name. “In the police interview he did not say he knew me, or that I was lying,” she said. “The relevance of my name was zilch. There was no reason. No one explained why he had my name.”

She became concerned about how easily she could be found on the internet. “When you typed my name into Google, it was everywhere,” she said. “Telling you where I was and what I was doing. It really freaked me out.”

She changed her name on social media and tried to delete mentions of herself on websites. She also changed her name at work, which she found the most difficult. “It was awful because it was what I was proud of. It’s my career,” she said. “One of the hardest things was having to [tell] my dad. Everything I achieve isn’t going to be in my family name. I’m now using this name that means nothing to me.”

Despite erasing her online presence and moving house since the attack, she still worries about how easy it is for her attacker to find her, especially as he is shortly up for parole. “I’ve only been told his name a few times, but I will remember it forever. We are now linked for the rest of our lives,” she said.

“Whenever he gets out I just don’t trust that he won’t try to find me. Why would he not?”

Under the draft amendment, police may not disclose the identity of a victim or witness of a serious sexual or violent offence to the person accused of the offence if it is reasonable to assume that such a disclosure would put the victim or witness at risk of further harm. Officers must take account of previous convictions, mental health and access to new technology or social media of the person accused of the offence, whether or not the accused has been charged.

The amendment, drafted by Voice4victims and put down by Plaid Cymru’s Dafydd Wigley, is due to be debated in the House of Lords early next month and is expected to go to vote in late November.

The Voice4victims director, Harry Fletcher, said: “It is of deep concern that there is neither policy nor legislation covering the disclosure of a victim’s identity to an alleged perpetrator of a serious sexual offence. It is astonishing that it is left to the discretion of individual police officers. Disclosure is extremely traumatic and leaves victims feeling terrified that they are put at further risk.”

A Metropolitan police spokesman said that in the case of a stranger rape, it would be very rare for the suspect to be informed at the point of arrest. The next point at which it could be disclosed was during interview. While this is uncommon, again, this would be a case-by-case decision, and the interviewing officer might have to disclose the name of the victim to prevent any defence of consent.

Melanie said many victims she had spoken to had just assumed their names had not been used. Of her own case, she said: “He didn’t get off the bus to attack me. He got off the bus to attack a woman.”

She said the fact that he knew her identity “made an attack that was by its very intention completely impersonal into a very, very personal thing”.

She said of her ordeal: “By far the most extreme and lasting violation was the handing over of my identity to the one person in the world I would do anything to remain a stranger to.”

Surgeons should stop being “paternalistic” and simply lay out all the options to “let patients choose” whether to undergo surgery, according to radical new guidance for medics.

The Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) has warned its 20,000 members that unless changes are made to the processes currently used to gain consent ahead of surgery, they could face a dramatic increase in the number of expensive litigation cases and compensation payouts. NHS trusts in England paid out more than £1.4bn in claims during 2015-16.

The new guidance follows a judgment last year from the supreme court in the case of Nadine Montgomery from Lanarkshire, whose son Sam has cerebral palsy. Montgomery was awarded £5.25m compensation because doctors did not explain the very small risk associated with a normal birth in her case – she is small and a type 1 diabetic.

Diabetic mothers can give birth to larger babies. One of the risks is shoulder dystocia, when the baby gets stuck during labour, which happened in Sam’s case. He was deprived of oxygen and suffered brain damage in 1999. Her obstetrician did not discuss that risk because it was small and did not offer a caesarean section.



Seven judges – an unusually large number because of the significance of the case – agreed that doctors must tell patients not only what they think they need to know but also the risks that might matter to the patient. “Up to now it has been the Bolam standard [from a 1957 case of that name] – what a responsible body of other doctors would do,” said Leslie Hamilton, a council member of the RCS. “This is a new standard. It is really about focusing on the ­individual patient. We now need to sit down and tell the patient all the other options and let the patient choose and not tell them.”

The implications for doctors are huge, said Hamilton, who said the supreme court ruling was a “real wake-up call”.

Lady Hale, one of the judges, also said that doctors must not discuss one particular treatment over other possible options. “It makes a lot of sense but we have never really done that,” said Hamilton. “We tell patients about a particular option and get them to sign the form.”

NHS practice has traditionally been to leave it to doctors to decide what risks to communicate to patients – in what the RCS called a more “paternalistic approach”. 



The Montgomery case means that doctors will have to explain all the options to their patients, including the ones they themselves would not recommend, and let them choose for themselves.

It will also probably have to be the consultant rather than one of the junior doctors who talks through the options and finally gets the patient’s agreement. ­Hamilton says the consent form – often signed on the morning of surgery – will have to be replaced by “a decision-making record” for which the details of the discussion are written down.



Consent forms have never been strong evidence in court anyway, said Hamilton, because a signature does not prove that the patient had all the details of the risks and benefits of the operation explained fully to them in advance of surgery. “The RCS is very concerned that doctors and hospitals haven’t fully appreciated how much the judgment given in 2015 changed our understanding of patient consent,” he said.

“The watershed judgment in the Montgomery case shifted the focus of consent towards the ­specific needs of the patient. Hospitals and medical staff are leaving themselves very vulnerable to expensive litigation and increased payouts by being slow to change the way the consent process happens. We cannot underestimate the psychological impact facing litigation can also have on doctors. It can do serious damage to their confidence in practice and their reputation. Doctors must protect themselves and their patients by ensuring the consent process is carried out properly.”

The RCS is also concerned that many NHS trusts are not allowing enough time for the consent process to be carried out properly during consultations. “The NHS is under huge pressure and seeing more patients than ever. It’s not hard to see how in many hospitals gaining a patient’s consent has become a paper tick-box exercise, hurriedly done in the minutes before a patient is wheeled into theatre for their procedure. Operating lists and consultation clinics are packed leaving little time for these important consent discussions,” said Hamilton.

Students at Brigham Young University who report sexual assault will no longer be investigated for possible violations of the strict honor code that bans drinking and premarital sex, the Mormon-owned school announced Wednesday in a major reversal to a practice that drew widespread scrutiny. 



The college accepted several recommendations made by a faculty council that reviewed how sexual assault cases are handled. The inquiry began in May after female students and alumni spoke out against the school opening honor code investigations of students who report abuses.

Victims’ advocates said the practice discouraged reporting of sexual violence, which is already underreported on campuses nationwide.

Two former BYU students who went public with their experiences said they were mostly pleased with the forthcoming changes at the school, where students must agree to an honor code forbidding premarital sex, drug use and drinking.

“By having an amnesty clause, we hopefully will let them know that they should not hold any self-blame, that we are here to provide help to them,” said Julie Valentine, a nursing professor who was on the council issuing the recommendations. “It also helps educate the whole community and the campus that we can’t have victim-blaming, that we need to reach out and offer support.”

The school remains under investigation by federal and state officials.

US education officials are looking at how BYU handles sexual assault reports. Utah’s department of public safety, meanwhile, is investigating whether university police officers inappropriately shared information on sexual assault cases with the honor code office.

The faculty council didn’t look into the police allegations but found that the federal Title IX office on campus sometimes shared victims’ names and details of their assaults with the honor code office after the investigations were complete, Valentine said.

The only information that can be shared now is about a perpetrator who is found to be guilty of sexual assault, she said. In those cases, the victim’s name will be redacted so only the suspect faces honor code discipline.

The school also will hire a victims’ advocate to provide confidential counseling for victims who want to discuss their options, Valentine said. Students previously were given a handout explaining their options but didn’t have somebody to talk to, she said.

The school will replace a part-time Title IX coordinator with a full-time coordinator. The Title IX office will be moved to a different area of campus far from the honor code office.

Students were informed of the findings and changes Wednesday in an email from the BYU president, Kevin Worthen, Valentine said.

Madeline MacDonald, 20, came forward after she said she was investigated by the honor code office following her report of being sexually assaulted on a 2014 date. Though she was cleared, the two-month review made her feel like a target rather than a victim.

“Within the bounds of how BYU already works, they’ve made a lot of amazing changes,” MacDonald said about the school’s recommendations. “But we’re not done.”

The report on the investigation’s findings didn’t address the way Mormon bishops handle students telling them about sexual assault. MacDonald said that was a key issue because bishops determined whether students were in good standing with the faith and therefore the university.

The report acknowledges that students said they had “varied” experiences reporting sexual assaults to local church leaders. It says the university doesn’t control that but will share the concerns with church officials.

Madi Barney, another former student who spoke out, said in a statement that she was encouraged but hoped BYU ensured the changes were implemented and provided a way for students to lodge complaints.

Barney said she was sexually assaulted and then told that she faced an honor code investigation after she reported it to police.

“Treating sexual assault like the heinous crime it is, and treating its victims with respect, is something that BYU should take very seriously – and it looks like they currently are,” Barney said.

The Associated Press doesn’t normally identify victims of sex crimes, but Barney and MacDonald say they want their names to be used to change policy.

Valentine said the decision for victims to come forward “put everything in a pressure cooker” and triggered an important discussion that led to the changes.

“Our hearts go out to all of these victims. I met with many of them, and it is really heartbreaking,” Valentine said. “We wish them healing and the best as they recover.”

The true cost of Heathrow airport expansion to the taxpayer is not being divulged by the government, according to a Conservative former transport minister, who said ministers needed to “come clean” over the probable £5bn-£10bn public cost for road and rail links.

Tory MP Stephen Hammond raised his concerns as it emerged that Heathrow executives would get millions in bonuses for securing approval for the £17.6bn third runway scheme.

Hammond, a transport minister from 2012-14 when the airports commission was studying the scheme, said the government was misinforming the public by announcing that: “Expansion costs will be paid for by the private sector, not by the taxpayer.” The transport secretary, Chris Grayling, had also omitted this in his statement to the house, he said.

“There will be a number of specific things we will be doing for Heathrow. The government and Heathrow need to come clean on what the cost to the taxpayer is going to be. No one would be surprised if it is £5bn, but we should just be honest about it,” Hammond added.

While the commission report estimated a £5bn bill for new roads and rail links, Transport for London put the potential cost as being as high as £18.4bn.

Heathrow said it had earmarked just £1bn, and that it only accepted direct responsibility for works to the M25, which the third runway would cross, and a few minor roads. The airport contends that it will be cutting traffic, despite adding up to 55 million passengers a year, and that revenues could offset the bill.

Heathrow confirmed on Wednesday that executives would be paid bonuses, for securing a new runway, that would be expected to run into several million pounds. A spokeswoman said the bonuses would depend on also reaching targets on customer service and profitability.

The bonus scheme, devised by Heathrow’s chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, and approved by shareholders last year, will mean senior managers getting rewards based on net earnings, passenger service and strategic targets for a third runway .

Holland-Kaye earned £2.06m last year including bonuses, more than doubling his basic salary of £885,000. The new scheme, linked to expansion, did not pay out in 2015, “as the performance in respect of this scheme is so uncertain at this stage”, according to the airport’s annual report.

In an unusual move, a further payment will depend on employee satisfaction and engagement scores, known as the “mojo bonus”, after “internal motivational practice” that was developed by Holland-Kaye.

Mojo may be rising at the airport faster than in the surrounding boroughs, where concerns over noise and air pollution have been heightened by a Department for Transport report into air quality. Campaigners have highlighted an apparent admission that pollution is likely to rise in parts of London with a third runway, which they say potentially makes the scheme illegal.

The report, produced by Parsons Brinckerhoff for the DfT, said that Heathrow was “at risk of worsening exceedances of limit values alongside some roads within greater London, but this would be unlikely to affect the overall zone compliance”.

However, this is likely to be contested. Legal opinion obtained by the Clean Air in London campaign, from Robert McCracken QC, states that worsening pollution in any areas that already exceed legal limits would break the law.

Grayling has said that the runway cannot go ahead without complying with air quality obligations, which the report suggests would be entirely dependent on proposed mitigation schemes from Heathrow.

A DfT spokesperson said: “The government believes that the Heathrow north-west runway scheme could be delivered without impacting on the UK’s compliance with air quality limit values, with a suitable package of policy and mitigation measures.“

Jenny Bates, Friends of the Earth pollution campaigner, said: “With 10,000 early deaths in the capital each year from air pollution this approach shows a callous disregard for people’s health. We believe this approach is at odds with EU rules on tackling air pollution.”

In the Commons, the prime minister, Theresa May, said the government had “looked very carefully at the air quality issues”. Challenged by Tanya Mathias, the Tory MP for Twickenham, on worsening air pollution and noise, May said: “The evidence shows that air quality requirements can be met.”

Earlier, Grayling endorsed the idea of building the third airport runway over the M25 using a bridge rather than digging a tunnel for Britain’s busiest motorway to pass underneath the runway. He said the scheme would minimise disruption to motorists and be cheaper than the tunnel, which has alarmed Highways England, the strategic roads authority.

While the so-called “ramp” has raised eyebrows, engineers insisted it was standard global practice. Chris Chalk, of the Institute of Civil Engineers transport expert panel, said: “Clearly there will have to be all sorts of simulations to ensure there is no risk of distracting drivers.” He said there would be a 150-metre width of bridge each side of the runway and that the gradient would be less steep than that on the runways at Manchester and Birmingham airports.

The view expressed in your editorial (25 October), defending the right of the Belfast bakers to refuse to make a cake supporting gay marriage, simply does not hold water. Icing a cake for an Arsenal supporter does not make the baker an Arsenal supporter. Similarly, icing a cake supporting gay marriage is not an endorsement of those comments by the baker.

The equalities act was drafted for good reason. In a free and open democracy it is essential that there is one law for all and that religion can’t be used as a cloak for discrimination of any kind.

The judge stated the law quite simply: “In the present case the appellants might elect not to provide a service that involves any religious or political message. What they may not do is provide a service that only reflects their own political or religious message in relation to sexual orientation.”

To go against this simple summary of the law would put us back to a time when landlords had signs in their windows saying “no blacks, no Irish, no dogs”.

I am disappointed that a Guardian leader writer can seek to defend the indefensible with such a convoluted non-argument.

• I am disappointed that the Guardian cannot see the difference between “Support gay marriage” and “Save Ulster from sodomy”. The first is a positive message which, whether you agree with it or not, oppresses no one. The second asserts falsely that the existence of a sexual minority threatens “Ulster”, implying that they must be discriminated against or suppressed. It was the slogan of a campaign to keep homosexuality illegal in Ulster and gave legitimacy to all sorts of attacks on gay people.

Secondly, the cake bakers were not having their freedom of expression infringed. No one was stopping them baking a cake with the message “Don’t support gay marriage”. Also, no one would have thought that the bakers supported gay marriage, any more than the message “Man U for the cup” would have meant that they supported Manchester United.

The gay couple had the right to express their views and the cake bakers offered a forum for this – until someone came along with a message they disagreed with. Freedom of speech means freedom for speech you disagree with, as long as it is not illegal.

Former prime minister David Cameron has been honoured for introducing same-sex marriage in England and Wales as he is recognised as “ally of the year” at the PinkNews awards held in Westminster.

In a speech, to be shown at the awards ceremony in Westminster on Wednesday night, Cameron speaks of his pride at the achievement and the “small role” he played.



“I think it was five years ago this month that I said to a Conservative party conference that I wanted us to champion equal marriage, that I wanted marriage to be there for men to marry men and women to marry women, as well as marriage as we’ve known it. And I’m really proud that we carried it through,” he says. 



“Because when you’re prime minister there are lots of things that you want to change. Some go right, some go wrong, some are instantly forgotten. But I know with this, with equal marriage, it is something that has already made a huge difference to people’s lives and will go on doing so in the future.



“So, for the small role I played in helping pushing it through and making it happen, I am very proud. It’s great to accept this award and I know it’s going to bring a lot of people a lot of pleasure for years to come. And it should.



“Marriage is a great institution and it should be there for everybody, and Britain has very much led the way.”

Previous winners of the PinkNews ally award have included former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg, former Scottish first minister Alex Salmond, former Labour leader Ed Miliband, and former equalities minister Lynne Featherstone.



Cameron’s video message will be played at the ceremony attended by more than 200 guests on Wednesday night, at which the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, will make a live speech. A pre-recorded message from the prime minister, Theresa May, will also be played. 



The award was presented to Cameron at his new central London offices by PinkNews chief executive Benjamin Cohen and his fiance, Dr Anthony James, along with Subodh Rathod and Niranjan Kamatkar, who were among couples who married on the first day same-sex marriage was legal.

MPs have launched an inquiry into pay and working conditions in the UK to reflect growing concerns about the rise of casual employment, agency work and the informal gig economy.

The business, energy and industrial strategy committee said it would investigate the rights of workers not permanently employed amid unease about exploitation as work becomes more precarious.

MPs said the investigation was in response to revelations about conditions at Sports Direct and Asos and concerns about treatment of couriers and drivers at Uber, Hermes and Deliveroo.

Ministers have ordered a crackdown on companies using large numbers of self-employed or agency workers after an investigation by the Guardian into low pay at the delivery company Hermes.

After the Guardian’s investigation into working conditions at Sports Direct, the committee produced a damning report into the retailer that condemned practices akin to a Victorian workhouse. Sports Direct highlighted wider concerns about the treatment of casual workers as the economy shifts from full-time employment.

Iain Wright, the committee’s chairman, said: “In our Sports Direct inquiry we exposed shocking examples of poor working practices, of agency workers paid less than the minimum wage and exploited through dubious voluntary schemes, such as pre-paid debit cards and deductions from pay for insurance services.

“In recent months we’ve seen growing evidence of agency workers and those working in the gig economy being exposed to poor working conditions. This growing trend raises questions over employment status and lack of worker rights.”

The inquiry raises the prospect of bosses of gig economy companies such as Hermes and Asos facing questions from MPs. Mike Ashley, Sports Direct’s majority owner, and Sir Philip Green, the former owner of BHS, have undergone gruelling sessions before the committee.

From drivers delivering packages to online shoppers to app-driven services such as Uber and Deliveroo, the gig economy, which has transformed delivery services, relies on large networks of self-employed contractors. Their status means they are not entitled to earn the “national living wage” or receive benefits such as sickness and holiday pay.

Unions have warned that a surge of people in self-employment demonstrates how workers are increasingly pressured to take up uncertain, low-paid employment as power has shifted from labour to employers after the long recession that followed the financial crisis.

The committee said it would seek to establish the status and rights of agency and casual workers and the self-employed for the purposes of tax, benefits and employment law and how to protect them. Other subjects include treatment of and possible limits on the use of agency workers; which rights should apply to permanent and non-permanent staff; the use of zero-hours contracts; and enforcement of the “national living wage”.



Drivers for the taxi-app company Uber are waiting on an employment tribunal verdict, due on 28 October, on their claim that they should be classed as workers rather than as self-employed. Deliveroo, which delivers meals to people’s homes from restaurants, backed down in August over changes to contracts for its drivers after weeks of protests.

Wright said: “The nature of work is undoubtedly changing. It will change further with growing use of technology and a spreading of automation across the economy.

“This might provide flexibility and choice for some people, but unleash insecurity and squeezed working conditions for others. With these economic and technological changes shaking up the world of work, it’s vitally important that workers are protected.”

The Gambia has announced its withdrawal from the international criminal court, accusing the tribunal of the “persecution and humiliation of people of colour, especially Africans”.

The announcement late on Tuesday came after similar decisions this month by South Africa and Burundi to abandon the troubled institution, set up to handle the world’s worst crimes.

Sheriff Bojang, the information minister, said in an announcement on state television that the court had been used “for the persecution of Africans and especially their leaders” while ignoring crimes committed by the west.

He singled out the case of the former British prime minister Tony Blair, whom the ICC decided not to indict over the Iraq war.

“There are many western countries, at least 30, that have committed heinous war crimes against independent sovereign states and their citizens since the creation of the ICC and not a single western war criminal has been indicted,” he said.

The withdrawal, he said, “is warranted by the fact that the ICC, despite being called international criminal court, is in fact an international caucasian court for the persecution and humiliation of people of colour, especially Africans”.

The ICC, set up in 2002, is often accused of bias against Africa and has also struggled with a lack of cooperation, including from the US, which signed the court’s treaty but has never ratified it.

The Gambia has been trying without success to use the court to punish the EU for deaths of thousands of African migrants trying to reach its shores. The decision will also come as a personal blow to the court’s chief prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, a former Gambian justice minister.

The court at the weekend asked South Africa and Burundi to reconsider their decisions to leave, which came as a major blow to the institution.



“I urge them to work together with other states in the fight against impunity, which often causes massive violations of human rights,” Sidiki Kaba, president of the assembly of state parties to the ICC founding treaty, said in a statement.

South Africa’s decision followed a dispute last year when the Sudanese president, Omar al-Bashir, visited the country despite being the subject of an ICC arrest warrant over alleged war crimes. Earlier this month, Burundi said it would leave the court, while Namibia and Kenya have also raised the possibility.

Kaba said he was concerned that South Africa and Burundi’s decisions would pave the way for other African states to leave the court.

The tribunal is tasked with “prosecuting the most serious crimes that shock the conscience of humanity, namely genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and crimes of aggression”.

The court’s former prosecutor Luis Moreno Ocampo criticised Burundi and South Africa, accusing them of giving leaders on the continent a free hand “to commit genocide”.

“Burundi is leaving the ICC to keep committing crimes against humanity and possible genocide in its territory. Burundi’s president wants free hands to attack civilians,” he said.

He added that the former South African president Nelson Mandela had “promoted the establishment of the court to avoid new massive crimes in Africa. Now under the Zuma leadership South Africa decided to cover up the crimes and abandoned African victims. The world is going backward.”

“The chaos is coming. Genocide in Burundi and a new African war are in motion,” he said.

Young offenders up to the age of 25 should be kept out of adult prisons because of “irrefutable evidence” that the typical adult male brain is not fully formed until at least the mid-20s, MPs have said.

The House of Commons justice select committee says young adults, who make up 10% of the adult prison population but account for 30-40% of police time, should be treated differently by the criminal justice system and be held in young offender institutions with 18- to 20-year-olds.

The MPs say that the most recent evidence shows that young people are reaching adult maturity five to seven years later than they did a few decades ago, which is affecting the age at which most typically grow out of crime.

The justice select committee report on young adult offenders cites behaviourial neuro-scientific evidence that this is reflected in the late development of those parts of their brain that determine how individuals weigh long-term gains against short-term reward efforts.

“As the brain is a plastic organ it can heal to an extent up to the age of 25 if taken out of ‘aversive circumstances’ which can cause brain changes, for example, separation from family and friends and exposure to punitive conditions,” the MPs argue.

“While the brain is continuing to develop there is a risk that problems will be compounded by involvement in the criminal justice system itself and that opportunities will be missed to repair the developmental harm caused by brain injury or other forms of trauma.”

The committee’s inquiry found those still offending into adulthood were more likely to have learning difficulties or communication disorders, or to have suffered head injuries and said flawed interventions by the prison and probation services did not recognise young adults’ needs and prevented them getting out of a cycle of crime. Young adults have the highest reconviction rates with 75% reconvicted within two years of release.

The report says that rates of learning disability, communication impairment and autistic spectrum disorder are 10 times higher among young offenders than among young people in the general population, and there is a high level of acquired brain injury – which, according to estimates by the Centre for Mental Health, can increase the likelihood of crime by 50%.

“These factors impact on criminal behaviour and have implications for the appropriate treatment of young adults by the criminal justice system as they are more challenging to manage, harder to engage, and tend to have poorer outcomes.”

Much of this recent research stems from a substantial research programme by the Transition to Adulthood Alliance, a coalition of 12 criminal justice, health and youth organisations.

The chair of the justice committee, Bob Neill, said: “Research findings in criminology, psychology and neurology indicate the need for a distinctive approach. There is overwhelming enthusiasm for change within the sector. And yet the government has been hesitant to act. We do not understand why it has not been more courageous, and has hidden behind outdated legislation. So we have used the evidence we received to develop a blueprint for change, which we expect the government to adopt as part of their forthcoming reform plan.”

A Ministry of Justice spokeswoman responded, saying: “Significant efforts have been made to divert young people from custody and this has resulted in a welcome reduction in the prison population – down 40% since 2010. But those in custody are in for longer and for more serious offences. We recognise the specific challenges associated with this age group and are committed to addressing these.”

The US-led coalition fighting Islamic State in Syria has killed at least 300 civilians in airstrikes, and must do more to prevent further civilian deaths as the battle for Mosul intensifies in neighbouring Iraq, Amnesty International has warned.

More than half of the victims identified in a new report by the rights group, which looked at deaths over the two years since western forces joined the fight against Isis in Syria, were killed during the fight for the city of Manbij.

It is important the lessons from those deaths are learned as a broad coalition of troops backed by US air power and special forces push towards Mosul, a much bigger city that is still home to about 600,000 civilians, the group says.

“In its backing of anti-Isis ground forces during this summer’s Manbij campaign, the US-led coalition killed some 250 or more civilians, and yet it does not acknowledge them,” said Neil Sammonds, Amnesty’s researcher for Syria.

“We fear that since it is not recognising or learning from such mistakes that in the campaign for Mosul, which is far greater than Manbij, the coalition is on course to kill even greater numbers of civilians and risk a serious backlash.”

The rights group spent months carrying out witness interviews, collecting photographic and video evidence, analysing satellite images and reviewing reports from local activists to determine the total number of deaths.

It is a conservative toll compared with estimates from other monitoring groups, which put the number of deaths from coalition bombing at 600 to 1,000. The monitoring groups include the Syrian Network for Human Rights, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and the Violations Documentation Centre.

Only a handful of deaths have been acknowledged by the coalition in its attacks in Syria. Amnesty is calling for more precautions before attacks, and independent investigations into possible violations of international law.

“We fear the US-led coalition is significantly underestimating the harm caused to civilians in its operations in Syria,” said Lynn Maalouf, deputy director for research at Amnesty International’s Beirut office.

“Some of these attacks may constitute disproportionate or otherwise indiscriminate attacks … It’s high time the US authorities came clean about the full extent of the civilian damage caused by coalition attacks in Syria.”

Three attacks near Manbij this summer were particularly deadly, killing more than 100 civilians, at least a third of them children. One of the attacks is being investigated by US authorities.

The scale of deaths is lower than from bombing raids by Russia, the other foreign power to have sent its jets to Syria. Russian raids have killed at least 3,600 civilians in just over a year and appear to have targeted civilians, while the coalition has been trying to avoid or limit civilian casualties, although it could do far more, human rights groups said.

The official recognition of Impress as a regulator moves us one step closer to yet another confrontation between press and parliament.

By itself, the decision by the Press Recognition Panel (PRP) doesn’t mean much. But should this government, or any government in the future, decide to implement section 40 of the crime and courts act, it will become hugely significant.

Even so, in advance of that law kicking in, newspaper publishers are anything but delighted by the recognition of Impress under the terms of the royal charter.

They have created their own regulator, the Independent Press Standards Organisation (Ipso), which they are determined will not seek recognition because they view the charter as an instrument of the state and therefore inimical to press freedom.



Now, with Ipso and Impress, we have two press regulators that, on the face of it, look hopelessly unequal. Ipso regulates a massive slice of the newspaper and magazine industry, including the majority of national titles, the overwhelming number of regional and local titles and the bulk of the magazine publishers.

Impress, by contrast, is regulating 26 small online news websites, with a further 24 awaiting compliance checks. David is pitched against Goliath?

What Goliath fears, however, is David’s sling: charter recognition is a threatening weapon that has the potential to hurt all publishers who are outside Impress, whether or not they have joined Ipso (such as the Guardian, Financial Times and Private Eye).

Impress’s very existence means that should the government bring about the introduction of the section 40 provision at any stage, then non-Impress publications face the possibility of paying the legal costs of people who sue them for libel or breaches of privacy, even if they win the case.

Impress members, by contrast, will enjoy protection from costs if people use its low-cost arbitration arm.

At present, if government leaks are to be believed, section 40 has been shelved for the time being. But the threat remains, as culture secretary Karen Bradley, suggested on Monday in addressing members of the Commons culture, media and sport committee.

She said: “I have made no decision on the timing of a decision on section 40. I don’t rule it out at some point in the future”.

So it appears as if the founder of Impress, chief executive Jonathan Heawood, and its funder, Max Mosley, will have to wait to achieve the full effect of their initiative.

Nevertheless, recognition represents a big step along the path to the kind of press regulation favoured by Lord Justice Leveson in the report that followed his eponymous inquiry.

Clearly, the upper house agrees with Sir Brian. The House of Lords voted for an amendment to the investigatory powers bill, which was aimed at forcing the government to introduce section 40.

That gave heart to Impress and its supporters, notably the press victims’ body, Hacked Off, while upsetting publishers and the Ipso chairman, Sir Alan Moses.

Several papers carried hyperbolic leading articles attacking the possibility of section 40 being triggered. The Sunday Times went so far as call it “state regulation of the press”.

Like so much of the newspaper comment on the subject, at both national and local level, this was way over the top. Even though I think the use of a royal charter, set up through the privy council, was misconceived, I cannot see how it amounts to state regulation.

Do publishers really think broadcast news is state-regulated because outlets are monitored by Ofcom? Is Sky News’s output subject to state regulation?

And while we’re on the subject of News Corporation, I hope no-one imagines that prime minister Theresa May and Rupert Murdoch sorted out the section 40 business when they met recently in New York. That would be too far-fetched, would it not?

Men convicted of same-sex sexual activity on the basis of outdated and homophobic laws will receive a full pardon, the Scottish government has announced.

Holyrood’s justice secretary, Michael Matheson, told the chamber on Tuesday afternoon that the parliament would bring forward a Scottish “Turing law” to automatically pardon gay and bisexual men convicted of sexual offences that are no longer criminal.

He added that his officials had also been in discussion with Police Scotland to identify the most effective way of ensuring that past convictions for consensual sex between men no longer appeared on a person’s criminal record.

A similar law intended to apply to England and Wales was scuppered by the Conservative justice minister, Sam Gyimah, on Friday after he spoke so long that it ran out of time.

Gyimah’s behaviour attracted cross-party condemnation after the private member’s bill, put forward by John Nicolson of the SNP, failed to pass to its next stage in the Commons.

Nicolson’s bill would have gone further than an amendment to the policing and crime bill proposed by the government, which only pardons the thousands of men who are already dead, while the living will have to apply to the Home Office to get their convictions overturned.

The law is named after Alan Turing, whose work during the second world war helped break the German Enigma code, who was pardoned posthumously in 2013. Turing was convicted of gross indecency in 1952 and chemically castrated. He died two years later and an inquest found he had killed himself.

Private homosexual acts between men aged over 21 were decriminalised in England and Wales in 1967, but the law in Scotland was not changed until 1980.

Addressing the Holyrood chamber on Tuesday, Matheson said: “It is sadly the case that Scotland has only relatively recently modernised our criminal laws so that they no longer discriminate against same-sex sexual activity. It is shocking to consider that consensual sex between men was only decriminalised in Scotland in 1980 and the age of consent for same-sex sexual activity was not equalised for sexual activity between men and women until 2001.

“Such laws clearly have no place in a modern and inclusive Scotland. However, there are people with criminal convictions for same-sex sexual activity that is now lawful and we must right this wrong.”

The Scottish Labour leader, Kezia Dugdale, who raised the question of pardons with the Scottish government, described it as “a historic moment”.

Dugdale, herself one of three openly gay party leaders in Holyrood, said: “Since devolution we have seen section 2A abolished, civil partnerships legislated for and then same sex marriages introduced.

“It’s easy enough to pat ourselves on the back, but what is just as important as getting things right for the future is accepting we got things wrong in the past. Then crucially righting those wrongs. This public acknowledgment that our laws were wrong is a historic moment for equality, acceptance and respect in our country.”

She added: “For many men, an apology is as important as a formal pardon – because an apology demonstrates that they should never have been branded criminal in the first place. I am therefore also pleased the Scottish government is seriously considering apologies alongside legislative pardons.”

Welcoming the announcement as an “important step”, Nicolson said: “We have made huge progress towards achieving LGBTI equality in recent years, with improvements in laws and attitudes that have seen Scotland now become the best country in Europe for LGBTI legal rights.

“Despite this welcome and hard-won progress we must never forget the appalling way that LGBTI people have been treated in the UK in our recent past.

“The criminalisation of gay and bisexual men, who were cautioned and convicted under homophobic laws that banned sex between consenting adult men is a blemish on our history and it is right that we now address this injustice with a full and automatic pardon, and a system that allows people to have these discriminatory convictions removed from their records.”

In recent weeks many people have behaved as though Theresa May has discretion to call a general election at any time. Apparently it is very easy to forget about obscure constitutional rules such as the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act, which the coalition government passed in 2011. Just as Odysseus had his hands tied to the mast so that he could listen to the sirens, the coalition passed a law to prevent an early election before 2015. They did so by allowing only two paths to an early election. The prime minister, and the queen, no longer have a say on their own.

One way is for parliament to vote for an early election, if two-thirds of all the members of the House of Commons (434 MPs) agree. The other way is for a simple majority, 51% of those voting, to pass a motion of no confidence in the government. The no-confidence motion has to take a specific form. A government cannot force backbenchers to agree to a bill, as John Major did on the EU, by making a vote on the bill one “of confidence”. If a no-confidence vote is passed, and a new government cannot be formed within two weeks (and approved in a new vote of confidence), then a general election occurs.

Parliament can evade the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act in two ways. It can repeal the act altogether, or it can pass a new act dictating that there will be an election on a certain date and that the act will not apply. But like the no-confidence option, this also requires the vote of a majority of the House of Commons. And unlike the no-confidence vote, it has to happen on three readings of the new law. None of these scenarios is attractive to May, and none may be possible in the current parliament.

The power dynamic in the current House of Commons and the Conservative government is shaped by the act. May has a working majority of 16 (26, if the Democratic Unionist party and Ulster Unionists are included). Therefore, any 27 Conservative MPs can ensure that this parliament remains in place until May 2020, when a general election is due under the terms of the act.

Current Conservative members have a number of incentives to oppose a new election. Seventy-four new Conservative MPs were elected in 2015. They have only had 18 months to prove that they will be good constituency MPs by holding surgeries, solving constituents’ problems, voting on legislation and generally building up a record to show that they can do the job.

Older MPs may oppose a new election on ideological grounds, either anti- or pro-Brexit. Anti-Brexiters may believe that given sufficient time, the government will find that negotiations are difficult and that the economy does not perform well under conditions of uncertainty, so they will be able to campaign for a soft Brexit in the next election. Pro-Brexit MPs may fear that there will be short-term economic dislocation that becomes obvious before an election can take place, so that remainers from other parties will be able to challenge them successfully.

There is another element of risk. Many Conservatives’ constituents voted in strong opposition to the position that the MP took in the referendum. Numerous Conservatives who campaigned to leave represent strong remain constituencies, according to the estimates of Chris Hanretty of the University of East Anglia. These include David Burrowes and Charlotte Leslie, who have majorities of less than 5,000. More numerous are the 70 MPs who campaigned to remain in the 100 strongest leave constituencies, including Johnny Mercer, with a majority of only 1,026 and Jackie Doyle-Price, whose majority was 536 in 2015. Any of these 70 could be vulnerable to a challenge from a revitalised Ukip or even from a Labour candidate who supported Brexit.

The next election in 2020 will take place with new constituency boundaries, and 50 seats will be eliminated. That means the current legislative game is being played inside a game of musical chairs: 50 members will lose their seats when the music stops. This increases MPs’ risk-aversion still further.

Jeremy Corbyn claims he supports the idea of a new election, but with his current polling that cannot be a rational position. Labour will vote against it. And smaller parties such as the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National party are in the delicious position of watching the Conservatives trapped in place, no matter what happens. Unless circumstances become so dire or the political culture changes sufficiently that broad, cross-party agreements are possible, the situation seems almost certain to continue. The coalition did tie hands to the mast – and the hands they tied were May’s.

The political row over whether human rights law can be extended to the battlefield will be reopened this week in a supreme court case over the legality of detaining a Taliban suspect in Afghanistan.

Nine justices of the supreme court will on Wednesday consider the case of Serdar Mohammed, who was held for 110 days by British troops in 2010 before being handed over to Afghan authorities for trial.

Mohammed alleges that the Afghan security services tortured him and forced him to thumbprint a document that said he had confessed to being a Taliban fighter. He was freed in 2014 and denies being an insurgent or preparing bombs.



Last year, the court of appeal ruled that Mohammed had been held illegally by British forces and denied access to a lawyer. At the time, the army was part of Isaf, the International Security Assistance Force, whose regulations required that any transfer to Afghan authorities take place within 96 hours.

Giving their judgment, the three senior judges – the lord chief justice, Lord Thomas, Lord Lloyd Jones and Lord Beaston – expressed “significant reservations in respect of the correctness of the decision extending the ECHR [the European convention on human rights] to the battlefield”. But they were bound, they said, by the precedents of previous cases.



Since then, relations between law firms bringing claims on behalf of detained Afghan and Iraqi suspects and the Ministry of Defence have degenerated into open recrimination. 



Two of the law firms, Leigh Day and Public Interest Lawyers, have been referred by the government to the Solicitors Regulation Authority over alleged malpractice in handling claims. They deny any wrongdoing. 



The prime minister, Theresa May, announced at the Conservative party conference this month that, in future, the government would derogate from the ECHR in future conflicts to prevent an “industry of vexatious claims” against soldiers. The decision was greeted with dismay by civil liberties groups. 



The Labour MP Harriet Harman, the chair of parliament’s joint committee on human rights, has written to the defence secretary, Michael Fallon, seeking a full explanation of May’s decision and asking whether it is justified. 



In the supreme court case this week, Mohammed is represented by lawyers from Leigh Day. A spokesperson for the firm said: “We are hopeful that the supreme court will recognise the fundamental importance of the rule of law especially in situations of internal armed conflict where instilling law and order is the primary objective of the British forces.”



Responding to the decision last summer, the then defence minister, Penny Mordaunt, said: “The notion that dangerous insurgents cannot be detained for more than a few hours is ludicrous. Our armed forces must be able to detain enemies who attempt to maim and kill UK service personnel and civilians. If the law does not allow that then the law must change.”

In a separate development, human rights groups have expressed alarm over changes to the oversight of regulations outlawing complicity in torture. The investigatory powers bill (IP) will, it is alleged, alter the statutory status of what is formally known as the “consolidated guidance to intelligence officers and service personnel on the detention and interviewing of detainees overseas, and on the passing and receipt of intelligence relating to detainees”.



Under the bill, the position of the intelligence services commissioner, who monitored the “consolidated guidance”, is being abolished. The guidance is not mentioned in the bill.



A spokesman for the human rights group Reprieve said: “It is alarming that the government is watering down oversight of its flagship anti-torture policy. The IP bill unravels measures taken by the previous prime minister to put oversight of UK torture policy on a legal footing. The [outgoing] intelligence services commissioner [Sir Mark Waller] has expressed concern over the absence of any reference to the torture policy – known as the ‘consolidated guidance’ – from the IP bill.

“Along with the government’s U-turn on its pledge to hold an independent, judge-led inquiry into rendition, this move shows that ministers are slipping back on the promises they made to ensure Britain would never again become complicit in torture.”



The issue was raised by the Liberal Democrat peer Lady Hamwee in a debate on the IP bill in the House of Lords last week. Replying for the government, the justice minister Lord Keen said monitoring would continue.



“The government have already made it clear that the new investigatory powers commissioner will bring together the existing responsibilities of the intelligence services commissioner, the interception of communications commissioner and the chief surveillance commissioner,” Keen said.

“That includes oversight of the consolidated guidance on the detention and interviewing of detainees. In addition, the investigatory powers commissioner will have a bigger budget and a dedicated staff of commissioners and inspectors, as well as independent legal advisers, to ensure that the highest levels of independent scrutiny are maintained.”



The supreme court is still due to deliver its long-awaited judgment on the rendition and torture claim of Abdel Hakim Belhaj, and his wife, Fatima Bouchar, which it heard last November.

For decades, women in rural South Africa have shouldered the burden of caring for mineworkers who return home with silicosis contracted in South Africa’s gold mines. These women do the back-breaking and emotionally taxing work of caring for men who are dying slow and painful deaths, their lungs irreparably scarred by the silica dust they breathe in underground.

Testimony from women in South Africa’s Eastern Cape province reveals the brutal toll silicosis has taken on families. “My husband was the sole breadwinner,” recalled one woman. “If we had money, he had sent it. During his last days, he lost his strength and his chest closed up. It was difficult for him to cover himself with blankets, so I would cover him up. He could not go outside to relieve himself, so he would do it right there in the bed. I would have to throw it away. On his last day his chest closed up completely. I am left with almost nothing.”

From village to village, such stories were a recurring refrain. “I used to carry [my husband] around,” said another woman. “I used to go from house to house asking for food, we had children going to school. At times I would get piece jobs so we could eat.”

Eventually, this woman’s husband became unable to breathe. He died before he could even get in a car to go to hospital.

These conditions are the predictable outcome of deliberate mining policies.

Starting in the 1880s, when gold was first discovered, gold mining houses colluded with British colonial governments to put in place a range of taxes and legislation that forced black men to leave their land to work in the mines.

Once there, these men were forced to do dangerous jobs. Their work exposed them to malnutrition, tuberculosis and dangerous levels of silica dust. Many developed silicosis, which scars the lungs, makes breathing difficult, increases vulnerability to tuberculosis and can ultimately cause asphyxiation.

Black women, on the other hand, were required to remain in rural areas, where they carried out the work of raising workers and, often, caring for them when they later returned home desperately ill.

This exploitation remained entrenched for most of the 20th century. The mining industry corrupted the medical examination boards ostensibly in charge of mineworkers’ health. The boards then underreported cases of silicosis, decreasing workers’ eligibility for compensation. Together with the apartheid government, the industry set up a distinct and difficult to use compensation scheme. One study by Deloitte found that less than 1.5% of claims had been paid out to eligible miners.

The consequences of this arrangement were predictable. A 2009 report revealed that almost all miners interviewed in the former republic of Transkei, the largest provider of mining labour, had symptoms of respiratory illness. None were formally employed. About 92% said they went without food or experienced hunger on a monthly basis.

South Africa’s post-apartheid constitution has allowed human rights lawyers and mineworkers to begin to hold mines accountable.

In 2011, South Africa’s constitutional court issued a landmark ruling allowing Thembekile Mankayi, who had contracted silicosis working underground, to sue AngloGold Ashanti for full loss of wages, damages and medical expenses, regardless of what was already available to him under the miner-specific compensation scheme.

Human rights lawyers subsequently petitioned the courts to allow a class action lawsuit; potentially, hundreds of thousands of miners would join together to sue for as much as 20-40bn rand (roughly £1.2bn-£2.3bn).

Two South African NGOs – the Treatment Action Campaign (TAC), an Aids activist group, and Sonke Gender Justice, a gender equality organisation – applied to join the case as amici curiae (impartial advisers to the court), introducing evidence on the social costs of silicosis.

TAC drew attention to the relationship between silicosis and TB. Sonke offered evidence on the gendered impact of silicosis, particularly the financial, emotional and physical burden borne by women and girls who care for sick mineworkers when they return home, often foregoing their own income and education. The amici argued for the authorisation of the class action, and the transmission of claims to widows and dependents.

Despite opposition by the mining houses, the court admitted them as amici. Sonke’s affidavit on the gendered impact of silicosis was also admitted into the proceedings.

In May this year, the Johannesburg high court granted its historic ruling. It amended existing common law to allow general damages to be transmitted to the widows and dependents of miners who died in the early stages of litigation. Prior to this ruling, if plaintiffs died before pleadings had closed their claims would become void.

The ruling sets an important precedent that affirms women’s rights and the imperative to remedy the gendered harms imposed by the mining industry. The mining companies are appealing the decision, however.

As the case unfolds, it is critical to remember what is at stake. A century of damage caused by the South African gold mining industry requires remedy. The mining companies must pay long overdue compensation to the workers, widows, children, and communities they impoverished.

Newspaper publishers have warned that if a would-be regulator funded by Max Mosley is formally recognised it would amount to “an attack on free speech” and expose the press to punitive and damaging legal costs.

The News Media Association (NMA) said it would be dangerous for approval to be given to Impress by the Press Recognition Panel at a meeting on Tuesday because it could lead to the triggering of legislation that will expose newspapers not signed up to its regime to pay the costs of both sides regardless of whether a complaint is rejected.

Lynne Anderson, the deputy chief executive of the NMA, said that Impress was “not independent, it is not funded by the industry but by a wealthy donor, it has no significant relevant publishers, it has no code of standards and it is not viable”.

Most major newspapers have their complaints handled by Ipso, which has refused to accept recognition by the Press Regulation Panel, arguing it would amount to state regulation. Some others, such as the Guardian and the Financial Times, have their own system of regulation – and none is a member of Impress.

Anderson added: “Recognising Impress would not create an effective press regulator but it would be an attack on free speech, imposing on 90% of the newspaper and magazine industry who have joined an effective self-regulator, Ipso, a system of punitive costs and damages designed to coerce them into compliance with a state-sponsored system of regulation.”



Recognition of any press regulator is meant to trigger section 40 of the Crime and Courts Act 2013, which would expose any newspaper not signed up to its regime to exemplary damages in libel cases and impose so-called cost-shifting.

Although the exemplary damages part of the act is already on the books, former culture secretary John Whittingdale decided last year not to commence cost-shifting under section 40 of the act. However, those in the industry say they expect a decision to recognise Impress would be followed by renewed calls to implement the legislation in full.

In an awkward appearance in front of the culture, media and sport select committee on Monday, the culture secretary, Karen Bradley, repeatedly refused to say when or if she would bring in cost-shifting. “I am considering the position very carefully,” she told the committee. “I have not made a decision about timing, and I certainly do not rule out commencing section 40 at some point in the future.”

Supporters of the section 40 legislation, which received cross-party support in the wake of the Leveson inquiry, claim it will help those with limited resources take on newspapers that print false stories about them. It is also designed to protect newspapers from paying costs awarded by judges if those taking them to court do not try working through an arbitration process.



However, newspapers say it will be abused by the rich and powerful to stifle the press and taken advantage of by lawyers pursuing spurious claims in the knowledge they will still be paid.

In the run-up to the PRP meeting, newspapers have used their leader columns to argue against imposing the costs rule. On Monday, the Sun made a direct appeal to the prime minister, Theresa May, not to allow “this historic calamity to happen on your watch”, describing it as “state-sponsored blackmail”.

The leader echoed its sister title, the Times, which last Thursday described the system of state-backed regulation as “inimical to freedom of expression” and said section 40 would create “perverse incentives” for the rich to intimidate the press. Pieces in the Daily Mail and the Telegraph made similar arguments.

Industry sources said many newspaper owners would continue to fight state-backed regulation if Impress is recognised, both through legal challenges and by trying to convince the government not to impose legislation that would force those who do not join to pay the costs of both sides in libel cases even if they win.

Avenues being considered include appeals under the Human Rights Act over freedom of expression and access to justice, and attempts to challenge the legitimacy of Impress in the UK courts.

Impress has so far been largely funded by £3.8m from Mosley, who won a privacy case against the News of the World over false claims he was involved in a “sick Nazi orgy” and has been one of the leading voices calling for tighter regulation of the press.

Ipso declined to comment on Tuesday’s meeting, but its chair, Sir Alan Moses, last week said the UK press would be “doomed” if it signed up to state-backed regulation. Referring to section 40, he told the Society of Editors conference in Carlisle: “You should be wary, very wary, very wary indeed of anything that looks like an attempt too corral you into submission.”

Other lives: Distinguished academic lawyer who became a judge sitting on both tax and social security appeals

Jill Harth, the first woman to publicly accuse Donald Trump of sexual misconduct, has threatened to countersue the Republican nominee for president, if he carries out the promise to sue his accusers he outlined in Gettysburg on Saturday.

“If he sues me, I know that truth is an absolute defense, and I will countersue for the emotional hurt and lost income his attacks have caused me,” Harth said in a statement on Monday afternoon.

Harth, who settled a 1997 sexual harassment lawsuit against Trump, initially stayed quiet as the businessman’s run for the White House gathered speed this year. She was inspired to speak to the Guardian in July, after Trump said she and other women were liars, when their stories were shared as part of a New York Times investigation.

“I’m not going to get an apology from him,” Harth told the Guardian. “But he really should have been taught, if you don’t have anything nice to say don’t say anything, OK? Don’t call me a liar.”



On Saturday in Gettysburg, Trump opened what was billed as a major policy address by saying he would sue all the women who have accused him of inappropriate sexual conduct. He has denied all such allegations.

His accusers, he said, had told “fabricated stories” that were part of a massive conspiracy perpetrated against him by Hillary Clinton’s campaign and the media.

“Every woman lied when they came forward to hurt my campaign, total fabrication,” he said, speaking hours before an 11th accuser, Jessica Drake, came forward at a press event in Los Angeles. On Monday WGIR radio’s New Hampshire Today broadcast remarks by Trump in which he said sarcastically of Drake, a porn star and sex educator: “Oh, I’m sure she’s never been grabbed before.”

Trump also said “the events never happened” and added: “All of these liars will be sued after the election is over.”

Trump has threatened to sue over allegations of sexual misbehavior, most recently the New York Times. The Times general counsel replied in a letter earlier this month, explaining the paper would not retract its report.

“Nothing in our article has had the slightest effect on the reputation that Mr Trump, through his own words and actions, has already created for himself,” wrote Times general counsel David McCraw.

Trump’s wife threatened to sue People magazine for publishing the story of an alleged assault of its writer Natasha Stoynoff, an allegation that Donald Trump has denied.

Melania Trump contended that a minor detail in Stoynoff’s story – that the two women saw each other in New York long after the assault had taken place – was incorrect. People responded by publishing the accounts of six witnesses who corroborated Stoynoff’s story.



On Monday, Harth’s lawyer, Lisa Bloom, said attempts to threaten Trump’s accusers into silence would not work.

“My law firm will continue to proudly represent Jill and any other accusers sued by Donald Trump and crowd-fund defense costs,” Bloom said in a statement, adding that she would subpoena Trump’s business and personal records for “any recordings that may exist in which he brags about sexual assault”.

The 11 women who have publicly accused Trump of sexual assault came forward after the publication two weeks ago of leaked Access Hollywood audio and video from 2005, in which Trump is heard bragging to TV host Billy Bush about actions amounting to serial sexual assault, including a claim that he was able to “grab” women “by the pussy”.

The actions described in the remarks bore similarities to Harth’s account of what she says Trump did to her in the early 1990s while purporting to give her a “tour” of his Mar-a-Lago Florida estate.

Trump apologized for the remarks, which he said were “locker room talk”. Questioned at the second presidential debate, he denied ever having done the things he described. Melania Trump and others have sought to dismiss the comments as an instance of “boys will be boys” behavior.

Bloom and her client contend that Trump’s recorded comments are part of an ongoing effort to bully women into staying quiet, something other women the Guardian has interviewed have described.

“I reject Donald Trump’s effort to intimidate and silence women,” Bloom said.

This weekend I sat in a television studio while Nigel Farage to all intents and purposes cast doubt on the women coming forward to say that Donald Trump had sexually assaulted them. He suggested that it was “strange” that they were all coming forward now and not at the time – despite the fact that some did. I wanted to shout across the studio: “Women don’t come forward because idiots like you say stupid stuff like that, that they are making it up for attention. You are part of the problem!” We live in a time when it is still perfectly acceptable for people to belittle experiences of sexual violence and to blame the victim; these throwaway comments trip off the tongue as easily as talking about the weather.

It is incredibly hard for a victim of rape or sexual violence to come forward. They feel shame. They are scared, and in many cases, have been groomed by their abuser to think that “no one will believe you”. I have met hundreds of women and men who said: “What’s the point? It will never come to anything.”

Many victims, especially children, feel that they are somehow responsible for what has happened to them, so with their shame they also feel guilt. In my time working for a charity that supported victims of sexual violence, we assisted thousands of victims who never sought justice for their trauma. Many who had dared to try then faced a “no further action” decision from the Crown Prosecution Service, which felt that their case or they as a credible witness would not stand up in court. Imagine being told: “You are not believable enough for your abuser to be held to account.” Or: “Sorry love, the fact that you have a criminal record means no one will believe you.” We need look no further than the cases of sexual violence in Rotherham and Rochdale to see what happens to young people who are disbelieved or considered the “wrong sort of witness”. This is still the case for the vast majority of rape victims; very few ever get a day in court and even fewer ever see their perpetrators convicted.

I’m worried that the way evidence was admitted in Ched Evans’s successful appeal has made this worse, and that it is now even less likely that victims will come forward. Essentially Evans was allowed a retrial on the basis that he could prove that his accuser had had consensual sex in similar circumstances and in a similar way that he alleges she behaved during his encounter with her. These similarities were, in my opinion, in no way unusual or individual enough to have been considered. This case fills me with dread. What is to stop any defendant in the future simply going on Facebook and crowd-sourcing information from a victim’s previous partners and using it against her in court?

Most people are raped or sexually abused by someone they know. It is very possible, likely even, that a perpetrator will know someone else a victim has had sex with before; they could be friends. Imagine for a second that you were raped by someone in your friendship group, who after you had told the police, went around your mates finding out what you had been up to and exactly what you said during sex, or how you moved. If I thought for a second that this might happen, I know it would make it harder for me to come forward.

With women from the parliamentary Labour party, I have written to the attorney general and the justice secretary to seek action to stop this. We want assurances that the Evans case will not act to make it even harder for victims to come forward. We want to know what the government is going to do to ensure this. Women in the Labour movement have spent decades fighting to improve the rights and treatment of victims of rape and sexual violence. Labour women have a proud history of developing rape crisis organisations, changing how victims give evidence in court and creating specialist independent sexual violence advisers to help victims seek justice. We will not sit back now and allow this case to undo years of slow but steady progress for victims who so often cannot speak for themselves.

Our colleague David Williams, who has died aged 70, was an expert in both revenue law and social security law.

He was born in Bishop’s Stortford, Hertfordshire, to Bill Williams, who worked in advertising after leaving the RAF, and his wife, Joan (nee Wallis). David attended Queen Elizabeth’s grammar school in Faversham, Kent, before studying law at Bristol University, where he took up his first academic post and qualified as a solicitor.

A gifted teacher and researcher, not to mention a loyal and supportive co-worker, he was headhunted by Manchester University, where he later became dean of law (1984-86), a role he reprised at Queen Mary and Westfield College (1991-93). His many publications included Social Security Taxation (1982), the first authoritative legal analysis of the national insurance contributions scheme, and Davies: Principles of Tax Law (with Geoffrey Morse, 1980), which is still a fixture on revenue law reading lists.

David had close links with tax scholars internationally and acted as a consultant both to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and emerging nations (such as Sierra Leone, where he was once caught up in a military coup). He also advised on the Tax Law Rewrite Project, initiated by HMRC in 1997.

He was appointed as a part-time tribunal chairman in the early 1980s and left the academic world to become a social security and child support commissioner in 1998 (he was an upper tribunal judge from 2008). Unusually he had extensive experience of sitting both at first instance and on second-tier appeals in both the social security and tax jurisdictions. He combined his adherence to the judicial oath, to “do right to all manner of people after the laws and usages of this realm, without fear or favour, affection or ill will” with his passionate belief in all people being equal and being entitled to a fair start in life.

Although raised in Kent, David became an adopted Welshman on marrying Elisabeth (nee Jones Pierce) in 1968, typically going the extra mile by learning Welsh. After a nomadic academic life, the couple settled on the Llŷn Peninsula in North Wales, where he enjoyed the great outdoors in his all too short retirement. He was a devoted husband, father and grandfather (or Taidy).

David is survived by Elisabeth and their three sons, Richard, Edward and Tom, and four grandchildren.

Search for “jury service” online and you will soon stumble across ways to get out of doing jury service. These aren’t always the most practical or legal: unless you’re prepared to fake a pregnancy, book an impromptu cruise or stick two pencils up your nose, Blackadder style, and say “wibble” a lot, you’re probably going to have to do jury service.

This is a good thing. Jury service can be a disruptive, inconvenient pain in the neck, but it’s also a vital public service and one of the cornerstones of our ... (all right, Dad, cut out the lecture). But here’s another reason why doing jury service is a good thing: it could turn out to be one of the most fascinating and rewarding experiences of your life.

I didn’t anticipate this. The court letter telling me I was being summoned for jury service was the first thing I opened when I got home from hospital with my newborn daughter (my actual baby, not one I had borrowed from the hospital in the hope of getting out of jury service, although, thinking about it now, that’s not the worst idea). In the state I was in at that moment, it was hard to care or even process what the letter was saying. It could have announced that I had won bronze in this year’s Latvian jelly sculpture awards, or informed me that I was being summoned for execution by the holographic overlords of the planet Quargum, and I would still probably have tossed it underneath some electricity bills and gone off to work out how to clean milky sick off the sofa.

But eventually my brain regained some kind of coherence and, on a Monday morning about two months later, I found myself arriving at court, as nervous as I was curious. Courts are serious and intimidating places, and probably seem even more serious and intimidating if you speak to pop musicians for a living. They’re also the kind of places that invite you to invent stories about the people you see huddled outside – who are they, how did they end up here? This isn’t ideal. Your job as a juror is largely to avoid doing this, at least when you’re sitting on a jury. You are urged to keep an open mind. And, if you do so, you will find a whole list of prejudices you never knew you had come crashing down with each passing day.

This was especially the case, at least for me, in terms of all the jurors I met during the two weeks. In 2016, we seem to have accepted the notion that the UK is divided, the Brexit vote a perfect emblem of a country where one half barely recognises the other, let alone goes out drinking with them on a Friday night; a place where old and young, rich and poor, are all pitted against each other. What’s more, we’ve become adept at reinforcing our differences by constructing personal online bubbles – reading news that fits our opinions and connecting with people who share similar interests.

Believe me, there’s nothing like a stint on a jury to cut through all that – you are thrown together with people from all walks of life. In the space of two weeks, I got to know builders, entrepreneurs, football referees, cooks, NHS workers, butlers and IT consultants. The jury on which I served was a mix of age, gender, race, religions, backgrounds ... you would almost think, having read the news over the past year or so, that we would be unable to communicate. And yet not only did we complete our task with dedication, but we also got along famously. When our case was over, we even went to the pub together. I felt sad that we would probably never see each other again.

I’m forbidden by law from telling you any juicy details of the case (spoiler: not actually that juicy) or revealing any of the fascinating stories that jurors shared about their lives. I especially can’t tell you about my heartfelt and moving speech that convinced the entire jury to change their decision at the last minute, although that’s mainly because it didn’t happen (other than in my head, every morning, on the way in).

For those reasons, I realise that this column may lack drama. I accept that 12 Reasonable Men and Women Who Respected Each Other’s Opinions and Got Along Nicely would not make for a particularly interesting sequel, not even if it focused on the dramatic scene during deliberations where I ate so many jelly sweets that I got a headache. But the experience did more for me than fulfil my sense of civic duty – it re-established my faith in humanity and gave me a small flicker of hope that, actually, we all might just be able to get along in future.

A leading member of the Philippines’ senate has called for an international criminal investigation into the country’s president in an effort to stop a vicious war on drugs that has killed more than 3,800 people since June.

Senator Leila de Lima, a human rights advocate and former justice secretary, has told the Guardian that foreign intervention was the only hope of putting an end to “state-inspired” extrajudicial murders that have terrorised parts of the population since president Rodrigo Duterte came to power four months ago.

In an interview De Lima urged world leaders to consider sanctions and the International Criminal Court (ICC) in the Hague to launch an investigation into Duterte and those who worked for him.

“It [ICC] should start to think about investigating already or doing an inquiry into the killings as crimes against humanity,” she said.

The senator fears for her own life after she was ousted last month as chair of an inquiry looking into the vigilante death squads targeting drug dealers and users, and her address and mobile number were made public.

“For a few weeks after that I was unable to go home, I slept in other places although I was able to sneak into my house from time to time, so I felt like a thief in the night in my own home,” she said.

“The more unfortunate thing is that ever since they publicised my cellphone number I did receive a lot, almost 2,000, of hate messages and death threats.”

De Lima has become the nemesis of Duterte, who swept to power in May on a mandate to enforce zero tolerance on drugs-related crime. He denies any links to extrajudicial murder, but critics say his inflammatory rhetoric has unleashed a wave of violence.

The president said he would “be happy to slaughter” three million Filipino drug users and peddlers, and has publicly urged citizens to “go ahead and kill” addicts and dealers.

About 1,500 of the dead have been killed in police operations, but most were murdered by unidentified assassins, leading to accusations that Duterte has allowed a state of lawlessness where criminals can settle vendettas with impunity.

Last month the Guardian reported how a serving senior police office had claimed that death squads were operating with official sanction in the capital, Manila, killing dozens of suspected drug users and pushers. The allegation has been denied.

Meanwhile Duterte has described innocent and child victims of the bloodbath as “collateral damage”. The youngest victim to date is Danica Mae, a five-year-old who was shot in the neck in August by a masked gunman targeting her grandfather.

Senator De Lima, a divorced mother of three and prominent lawyer, is Duterte’s fiercest and most high-profile opponent.

Her pleas for outside help come after her own efforts to expose what she claims is the truth of the bloody crackdown on drugs put her life in danger.

In August, as head of the senate justice committee, she launched hearings to investigate the surge in killings by vigilante gangs.

Her lone crusade won her many powerful enemies, not least the president, who told her first to resign then to hang herself.

In September the animosity between De Lima and Duterte erupted when she invited self-professed hitman, Edgar Matobato, to testify.

He alleged that Duterte had once shot dead a justice department official with an Uzi submachine gun and ordered the killing of criminals and political rivals while mayor of Davao City, in the south of the Philippines.

The president strongly denied the claims and apparent inconsistencies were found in Matobato’s cross-examination.

De Lima faced a backlash from Duterte’s supporters, led by Manny Pacquiao, the former boxing superstar, and now a senator. She was ousted as committee chair, then the death threats began.

“It got worse ever since this thing exploded, ever since the president himself would viciously attack me, would vilify me publicly with his pronouncements,” she said.

“I’m not really saying that such a threat comes from the president himself or from his men, but he’s got a throng of fanatical supporters so any of those can think about harming me. The threat is there whether or not it’s sanctioned by the president.”

De Lima has since been accused of corruption and links to drug lords. Her critics allege she was complicit in the drugs trade in the national Bilibit prison when she was head of the department of justice, claiming that inmates raised money to fund her 2016 senatorial bid. She denies all charges, denouncing them as a “sham”.



She has been subjected to a ruthless character assassination, full of sexually explicit slurs.

“De Lima is not only screwing her driver, she is also screwing the nation,” Duterte said in September, referring to accusations that she had an affair with her driver, who allegedly collected payoffs from criminals.

The senator has been threatened with the exposure of a “sex tape”, the existence of which has never been verified.

Such personal attacks only revealed Duterte’s innate sexism, she charged.

“I am undoubtedly being targeted because I’m a woman, because we have a misogynistic president. He regards women as inferior ... that we are second-class citizens.”

De Lima feels she is fighting an “unwinnable war”, prompting her calls for international intervention.

Duterte’s war on drugs has already been condemned by the United Nations, European Union and the United States.

He responded with expletives, telling the EU “Fuck you” and calling the US president, Barack Obama, a “son of a whore”.

Earlier in October, the International Criminal Court’s chief prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, said her office were watching for signs of officials “ordering, requesting, encouraging or contributing” to crimes against humanity.

De Lima argues the stage is already set for the ICC to step in.

“I believe that the ICC, given the current situation, under the current factual premises that we have, the continued killings, would have rightful jurisdiction,” she said.

They should have the right to investigate “anyone, including the president, and his lieutenants, those who implement his orders”, she added.

“I have no doubt in my mind that this is really state-inspired,” De Lima said. “You cannot dismiss this sort of rhetoric as just a figure of speech or hyperbole because that’s not how the people on the ground have been interpreting the pronouncements of the president.”

The EU and the UN should monitor developments and start rethinking aid packages, while remembering that the administration did not reflect the “real sentiments of the people”, she said.

Sanctions were “an option”, but decisions should be left to the foreign countries concerned.

Meanwhile De Lima admits her own fight is a “lonely” one.

“There is not much support, particularly from politicians. I do feel there is some groundswell of support from ordinary people,” she said.

“On the whole, the majority is still silent. But I do know that more people are beginning to get worried because more people are beginning to really think about what’s happening.”

Everybody has fear,” says Albert Woodfox. “Fear is the soul telling the body that it’s in danger. Some people overcome that fear. I overcame it by having a cause. That’s what the party told me: always be honourable, always serve the people.” Woodfox, now a grizzled 69-year-old, has had more reasons to be afraid than most, and when he says that he has known “more pain and suffering than any human being should be asked to suffer”, he is not exaggerating. At the hands of the American penal and judicial system he has endured wrongful imprisonment and deprivation of basic needs to a degree that seems outlandish in an advanced democracy. Yet his experience is not unique. It is an extreme version of something inflicted on thousands of others, and it is on behalf of these others that, he says, he continues to fight.

This February, as he puts it, “I walked through the gates of hell into freedom.” He was released from 45 years incarceration, almost 44 of them in solitary confinement, for most of the time in the Louisiana State Penitentiary, also known as Angola prison. Originally imprisoned for armed robbery, he was later sentenced for the fatal stabbing in 1972 of a prison guard called Brent Miller, a conviction ruled unsafe three times by a federal judge. Together with two other prisoners subjected to decades of solitary, Robert King and Herman Wallace, Woodfox was one of the “Angola Three”, whose treatment provoked sustained campaigns for their release . Wallace was convicted along with Woodfox for Miller’s murder, King for a separate murder of another prisoner, of which he was eventually cleared.

Even had he been guilty of Miller’s murder, decades of solitary confinement would be an exceptionally sadistic punishment, one defined as “torture” by the United Nations. Woodfox believes it was inflicted on him because he joined the Black Panthers in prison, the “party” to which he refers. “I know how many times they offered that if I gave up my party they’d let me out of solitary. Each time I told them, get out of my face.”

The phrase “solitary confinement” might suggest total isolation, a blank-walled cell with a lightbulb, food pushed through a slot in the wall, a condition which over any length of time would destroy anyone. Woodfox is at pains to say that in Angola his was not this “Hollywood” version but rather 23 hours a day locked into an 9ft by 6ft (2.7 metres by 1.8 metres) cell, barred at one end, in a tier of “14, 15, 16” similar cells. Some communication was possible with neighbours, even if he could not see them, or with other inmates on their way to the showers. The Angola Three made themselves chess sets out of twisted toilet paper and played games by shouting moves to each other. Woodfox would also walk repeatedly up and down his three-yard-long universe in an effort to keep fit.

The former attorney general of Louisiana James “Buddy” Caldwell has tried to argue that this wasn’t really solitary at all, on the basis of the limited human contact allowed – that, rather than being absolutely unsurvivable, it was merely almost so. The United Nations disagrees with his definition and says that no form of solitary confinement should be imposed for more than 15 days – that is, about a thousandth of Woodfox’s punishment – after which some of the harmful psychological effects of isolation can become irreversible. CCR, or closed cell restricted, to give the term preferred by the prison system, is incomprehensibly harsh. Some inmates, none of whom suffered it as long as Woodfox did, curled themselves up in foetal positions, others screamed. “That may seem good,” says Woodfox of the fact he could talk to other prisoners, “but given the nature of some of these guys driven insane, sometimes it wasn’t.”

He himself suffered panic attacks – sweating, a feeling of being smothered that obliged him to sleep sitting up. So he was not unscathed, but with the two other members of the Angola Three “came to the conclusion that we were going to survive”. They taught themselves criminal law and civil law and committed themselves to fighting for their own and others’ causes. “From my mom,” Woodfox also says, “I inherited values and principles that I was able to use: loyalty and devotion, education and discipline. I was able to self-educate, to define who I was.” How did he get the books? “In prison there’s always a black market system.”

The Angola Three would fight for better conditions in the prison – for example, for access to TV, newspapers and occasional exercise that was initially denied them, and against the degrading way in which their food was pushed into their cell along the ground, under the wall of bars. They used hunger strikes if necessary, “the most effective but the most brutal way”. They would campaign for their own release and against wider injustices in American society. “We argued, but we never broke faith,” Woodfox says in Cruel and Unusual, a feature documentary about the Angola Three that will be shown on Channel 4 later this year. “We could die in prison if that’s what it took. Once you break that spirit, you can’t get it back.”

Now he sits in the Washington flat (contemporary in style, greyish-white, subdued) of one of his loyal band of supporters, where he is staying in the brief pause between one public event in the nation’s capital and another in Chicago. He combines an astonishing level of outward calm and peace with a sense of something held in. He is both polite and frank but also seems removed, as his way of dealing with his drastic experiences. Above all, he seems to be maintaining the ferocious self-discipline that kept him sane inside. “I still have claustrophobic attacks, panic attacks,” he says, “I still get angry. I just choose to use my anger as a means for changing things”.

He has had the Rip Van Winkle experience of leaving society in one era and re-entering it in another, except that he didn’t find that racial politics in the United States had made as much progress as you might think. It was as if the hair, fashion and music of 1971 were still the same, only in the field of social relations. “So far,” he says of the state of America before and after his imprisonment, “my observation is that while there appear to be changes in the country, the changes that did occur are really superficial.” He sees the successes of Donald Trump as evidence: “He has made racism and bigotry legitimate. He is not going to go away if he loses. It will take another generation to get rid of this kind of garbage.”

As far as Woodfox is concerned, he has been grappling with racism all his life, ever since he grew up in New Orleans. He also admits faults of his own. “A lot of people have no idea how African Americans lived in the 60s,” he says. “The vast majority lived in ghettoes, the majority couldn’t get jobs or else they got worse paid for the same jobs than white people did. I was a petty criminal at one time. It was a way to survive at times of desperation. I wasn’t stealing just to steal, I would steal to bring food into the house. Other than that, it was bullshit things like stealing a car. But I was still a predator on my own people.”

Then he was sent to Angola, 140 miles inland from New Orleans, the largest maximum security prison in the US and a place whose notorious horrors have long exercised a special fascination on writers, film-makers and reformers. It occupies a former plantation – its name refers to the place of origin of its slaves – and following the civil war was owned by a former Confederate major who ran it along lines very like its former existence. African Americans sent there on often slender pretexts were forced to work its fields for the profit of its owners, in a way barely distinguishable from slavery.

Despite periodic attempts at reform, a recitative of outrage about Angola sounds through the decades, in magazines, books and newspapers. Its regime was “probably as close to slavery as any person could come in 1930”. In 1952 it was “the worst prison in America”. In the 1960s it was “the bloodiest prison in the south”. In 1971 the American Bar Association said that its conditions were “medieval, squalid and horrifying”. “Every week,” says Woodfox, “someone there was killed or seriously injured.” “I know guys in Angola”, he also says, “who have been there 40 years for having a bag of dope.” In this telling, given that prisoners still work in its farms and factories for minimal pay, 200-year-old habits are dying hard.

Woodfox states his innocence of the armed robbery charge that had him sent to Angola: “I lent my car to my friend and he was involved in a shoot-out with the police.” Inside the prison, he started protesting for better conditions. He joined the Black Panthers, the revolutionary black nationalist movement that had reached the peak of its fame and influence in the late 1960s. Woodfox had encountered them in New York while on the run from imprisonment, and been inspired by the confidence and empowerment, until then unfamiliar to him, with which he saw the party’s young black men speak. In Angola he followed the Panthers’ model of self-defence: “We were organising against racism and against corruption.” They fought, for example, the appropriation by security staff of food and clothing meant for prisoners.

He helped start “anti-rape squads”. “Every Thursday – you call it Fresh Fish Day – when new arrivals come by bus and get assigned to various camps. Guys would gang up on them, trick them into accepting gifts and then demand payment, which they can’t pay. So they’d say ‘you’ve got to be my gal-boy’. They’d make them into prostitutes, rent them out.” Sometimes “it would be two or three guys on one man”. Sometimes victims would die as a result of their assaults. Woodfox says that the guards knew about it, but they were paid off.

He and his allies would “look for first-timers when they got off the bus and try and educate them.” He says they were “loved and respected” by other inmates, but “the predators hated our guts”. The anti-rape squads were threatened with weapons. “They said ‘it’s not your business’. We said ‘we’re making it our business’.”

Then Brent Miller, 23 years old and married for two months to 17-year-old Teenie, was killed, stabbed 38 times with a knife and a sharpened lawnmower blade. “I never met him, I never talked with him,” says Woodfox. “I was in the dining hall eating breakfast.” He had witnesses to back him up. The prosecution’s chief witness was Hezekiah Brown, a serial rapist serving life without parole, who was described as a “professional snitch” by a fellow inmate and of whom a deputy warden of the prison would say “Hezekiah was one you could put words into his mouth”. Having first said that he did not witness the crime, he was offered privileges, luxuries such as cigarettes and ultimately freedom to testify against Woodfox and Wallace. He was threatened with solitary if he did not.

Bloody fingerprints at the scene of the crime matched neither of the accused’s and no effort was made to find out whose they were, out of the limited pool of prisoners. Later, during the protracted appeals against their convictions, DNA evidence that might have exonerated Woodfox and Wallace went missing. Among those unconvinced by the evidence would be Miller’s widow, Teenie. “Brent was my whole life,” she later said, “he was witty, handsome and talented. He sang and played the drums. He was an all-round good soul.” But she became “very, very angry” that, in her view, the wrong men were convicted.

Woodfox and Wallace were tried separately in the court house in St Francisville, which, as the place where many of the penitentiary’s large staff live, is almost a company town. All-white juries, who had not been told of Brown’s incentives, found them guilty. Woodfox and Wallace were put in solitary, in principle a short-term disciplinary measure. It has to be renewed after 90 days, which it was, again and again, until the days turned into years and decades. “They were saying we were physically dangerous to ourselves or others,” says Woodfox, “they didn’t let us out because of our reputation, that the young would copy us… bullsh-i-i-i-i-t.” During this time, to fast-forward more than half a lifetime of legal agonies, dragged out by the authorities to a barely credible degree, the following landmark dates stand out.

In 1992 Woodfox’s conviction was overturned. In 1993 he was indicted again and for some reason he had to wait until 1998 before a retrial, at which point he was convicted again. The jury’s forewoman at the time of the reindictment was Anne Butler, formerly married to a former Angola warden, Murray Henderson, and author of a book in which she stated her belief in the guilt of the accused. Even she, it was reported, wondered why she was allowed on the jury.

Woodfox’s second conviction was overturned in 2008 by James J Brady, senior federal judge for the Middle District of Louisiana, and then reinstated in 2010 by a higher court, the Fifth Circuit. It was overturned again in 2013, a decision upheld in 2014 by the Fifth Circuit. In 2015 the state indicted Woodfox for the third time after which Judge Brady issued a rare writ banning a retrial, on the basis that the state were unlikely to give him a fair trial, that key witnesses were all dead and that Woodfox’s age and health meant that he too might die before the process was concluded. The state appealed and in November 2015 the Fifth found Brady’s writ excessive, a judgment then appealed by Woodfox.

Early this year, on the advice of his lawyers and in order to end the interminable legal struggle, he reached an agreement with the state whereby he pleaded no contest to its charges and was released on his birthday, 19 February. This wasn’t easy. “The internal struggle for me was,” he recently said, “I had spent 43 years of my life never backing down, never compromising what I believe in.” But “somehow my daughter and my grandkids and great grandkids coming to visit gave me the strength to say, ‘Yeah, you’re not compromising on anything. It’s not a plea of guilt. This is a plea for freedom.’”

Meanwhile, in 2001, Robert King’s conviction was overturned and he was released. Herman Wallace had his conviction overturned in 2013 but, even though he was in the final stages of liver cancer, the prison still prevaricated about his release. Only under the threat of being charged with contempt of court did they let him out. He was reindicted by the state two days later. The day after that he died.

During this time the Angola Three became famous for the injustice of their cases and the cruelty to which they were subjected. Their story became the centre of the ongoing campaign to end solitary confinement and the International Coalition to Free the Angola Three was created. The founder of The Body Shop, Anita Roddick, championed their cause and her husband Gordon continued to do so after her death.

The Angola Three endured, day after day, the extreme deprivations and arbitrary humiliations of CCR. Woodfox’s mother and sister died while he was inside, and he was banned from attending their funerals. His brother Michael survives, and visited every month even when displaced by Hurricane Katrina – even when it required a five- or six-hour drive for the two hours’ visiting time permitted by the prison.

The Angola Three were subjected to routine strip and anal cavity searches, sometimes six times a day, until in 1978, their lawsuit to have them restricted was successful. In 2013 the searches started on Woodfox again, requiring another court order that was then appealed by the state. I ask if there were exceptions to what appears to be a story of unmitigated official brutality. “There are exceptions, people who are able to hold on to their humanity, who are able to avoid the Robocop syndrome. But absolute power corrupts. Prison guards have absolute power because they realise they can do pretty much what they want.”

In Angola, he also says, “you have families that go back generations. They graduate from high school and a week later, they work in Angola. It keeps a tradition going. They become part of the system. Who knows how long it’s been going on?”

Of course, those responsible for the Angola Three’s confinement see things differently. One is the devout Southern Baptist Burl Cain, who was warden of Angola from 1992 until he stood down on 1 January this year, under allegations that he inappropriately entered into business deals with relatives of inmates. Described by The Economist as “a rockstar of the correctional world”, he won fame and praise for reducing Angola’s rates of violence. In his words, he “transformed this place from a facility of violence and despair to one of peace and morality”, a task he set about with what one prisoner called “a Bible in one hand and a sword in the other” or what the Baptist Press called “a firm hand and a strong love for Jesus.”

Interviewed in 2008 by Woodfox’s attorney Nick Trenticosta, Cain cited a 1973 letter in which the prisoner called violent revolution “a highly necessary occurrence in life”. Trenticosta asked if the passage of time, years of good behaviour and the overturning of his second conviction counted for anything. “He’s just good because he is locked in CCR,” said Cain, “not because he’s good at heart… Because the lion in a cage can’t cause much trouble, you see.” Trenticosta asked Cain to assume “if you can” that Woodfox was innocent of Miller’s killing. “I would still keep him in CCR. I still know that he is still trying to practise Black Pantherism, and I still would not want him walking around my prison, because he would organise the young new inmates.”

The most persistent adversary of the Angola Three is Buddy Caldwell, attorney general of Louisiana until he was voted out last year amid accusations of what his opponent called “cronyism, nepotism and corruption”. It was under his direction that the state fought so hard to keep Woodfox in prison, where he would probably still be today if Caldwell were still in office. “This is the most dangerous person on the planet,” Caldwell has said, and “I oppose letting him out with every fibre of my being.” He has stated his complete faith in the process that led to Woodfox and Wallace’s convictions and has praised Hezekiah Brown’s courage for testifying in the face of possible intimidation.

Miller’s siblings, unlike his widow, believe in Woodfox and Wallace’s guilt and opposed his release. There is also a website, the Officer Down Memorial Page, which remembers “all of law enforcement’s heroes”: it simply states, without reference to the vacated convictions, that he was killed by members of the Black Panthers, “a racist, radical group that professed the murders of law enforcement officers”. But Woodfox and Wallace’s accusers have failed, over decades of legal scrutiny, to make their case without glaring flaws.

Central to the case of the Angola Three are the fears and emotions that the Black Panthers still arouse, 50 years after their founding and more than 30 years after they faded away in the early 80s. J Edgar Hoover called them “the greatest threat to the internal security of the country” and, as is now known, set about destabilising them, getting its leaders locked up and, if desired, killed. In this context, where someone like Woodfox is deemed a threat to the future of the US, the attitudes and practices of someone like Cain become, though not justifiable, explicable.

It is also is a matter of record that Black Panthers advocated violence and expressed sympathy for the likes of Stalin, Mao Zedong and the regime of North Korea. As well as fighting flagrant injustice and founding free food and health programmes for the poor, some of its factions resorted to criminal gangsterism and included murder, torture and rape among their methods. Now that Woodfox is free and dedicated to campaigning, I ask him if he means to do this by legal and democratic means. “That’s the culture and tradition of America,” he answers. Of the letter cited by Cain, he says that he wasn’t “advocating revolution, just explaining what it would entail”.

But he is not going to disavow the party, and the day before our interview he shared a platform in a Washington convention centre with Bobby Seale, who with Huey Newton founded the Panthers. Rather, he sees campaigns like Black Lives Matter, with which he is involved, as “an extension of what the Black Panther Party was”. They want “what our ancestors have always been asking for, just to be equal”. To achieve this “we have to do something different, because we are too predictable. We’re not even allowed the right to resist. If we do, we’re criminals.”

It was, he says, “so disappointing when I got out to find that conditions when I left 45 years ago are still here. With the first black president, everyone thought we had reached a milestone, but it just looked different.” If, he continues “America has nothing else to thank Donald Trump for, it is to show that racism is very much alive. He didn’t come out of nowhere. I thought the battle would be economic, not sick-assed philosophy about racism 45 years later.”

And so he is travelling and speaking, jetting from one American city to another to speak of his experiences and to fight, along with Robert King, for “the abolishment of solitary confinement and freedom for political prisoners” – and political prisoners is what he believes many of those incarcerated in America to be – “who remain victims of the criminal injustice system in the USA.” Apart from his fugitive trip to New York, he had never been out of Louisiana until this year, but now he travels from coast to coast and north to south, and is coming to Britain next month for a multi-city tour. All this from a man who came out of jail with hepatitis C, diabetes, renal failure and hypertension. His health has improved dramatically in the months of his freedom, partly due to receiving treatments denied him inside.

“We’re trying to get some kind of civil oversight,” he says, “to hold the administration accountable. When society looks the other way then the judicial system, from police to the courts to the prisons, becomes judge, jury and executioner.” The treatment of people like himself “is more than a legal issue, it’s a moral issue. It’s no different to what they do in other countries that we call dictatorships. We just have a more sophisticated way of doing it.”

He gets support from the people who campaigned for his release, from fellow activists, and especially from his brother – “my rock” – who is all that is left of the family he grew up with. But in general he likes to downplay the drama of his transition and to stress that, through continuing the activism that he started inside prison, his move to life outside was made easier. “There’s some residue, but it doesn’t dominate my life. I was not connected to the prison system. I did not have to break a lot of ties to the prison culture. I was already free in my mind. There was more like a physical adjustment. I had to learn to live beyond a 9ft cell.” Has he even had a holiday since his release in February? “I went to Yosemite. I read a lot of National Geographic in prison and I had a lifetime desire to go there. It was overwhelming.”

Artificial intelligence software that can find patterns in highly complex decisions is being used to predict our taste in films, TV shows and music with ever-increasing accuracy. And now, after a breakthrough study by a group of British scientists, it could be used to predict the outcome of trials.

Software that is able to weigh up legal evidence and moral questions of right and wrong has been devised by computer scientists at University College London, and used to accurately predict the result in hundreds of real life cases.

The AI “judge” has reached the same verdicts as judges at the European court of humanrights in almost four in five cases involving torture, degrading treatment and privacy.

The algorithm examined English language data sets for 584 cases relating to torture and degrading treatment, fair trials and privacy. In each case, the software analysed the information and made its own judicial decision. In 79% of those assessed, the AI verdict was the same as the one delivered by the court.

Dr Nikolaos Aletras, the lead researcher from UCL’s department of computer science, said: “We don’t see AI replacing judges or lawyers, but we think they’d find it useful for rapidly identifying patterns in cases that lead to certain outcomes.

“It could also be a valuable tool for highlighting which cases are most likely to be violations of the European convention on human rights.” An equal number of “violation” and “non-violation” cases were chosen for the study.

In the course of developing the programme the team found that judgments of the European court of human rights depends more on non-legal facts than purely legal arguments.

This suggests that the court’s judges are more legal theory “realists” than “formalists”. The same is true of other high level courts, such as the US supreme court, according to previous studies.

The most reliable factors for predicting European court of human rights decisions were found to be the language used as well as the topics and circumstances mentioned in the case texts.

The study’s co-author, Dr Dimitrios Tsarapatsanis, a law lecturer from Sheffield university, where Aletras completed his doctorate, said the study was the first of its kind.

It corroborated the findings of other research on the factors that influenced the judgments of high level courts, he said. “It should be further pursued and refined through the systematic examination of more data.”

Dr Vasileios Lampos, a UCL computer scientist, added: “Previous studies have predicted outcomes based on the nature of the crime or the policy position of each judge, so this is the first time judgments have been predicted using analysis of text prepared by the court.

“We expect this sort of tool would improve efficiencies of high-level, in-demand courts, but, to become a reality, we need to test it against more articles and the case data submitted to the court.”

Lawyers are increasingly making use of software that can perform complex tasks – such as searching for concepts rather than simple keywords – which can greatly reduce the amount of time needed to determine what documents might be relevant to a case, for example.

For the time being, however, Judge Judy – or Judge Rinder, for that matter – may not need to think about retraining just yet.

The findings by Aletras and his colleagues were published in the journal PeerJ Computer Science.

Letters: The naming of people on arrest rarely helps the investigation and frequently damages the reputations of people who are not subsequently charged
###########################################################
Carl Cattermole’s vivid picture of the background to the Pentonville murder last week (What a killing in Pentonville tells us about our prisons, 21 October) omits one aspect of the analysis. The security quotient in our prisons is now so great that when the pressures build, major disturbances are much less likely than was the case 20 years ago. I was a member of Lord Woolf’s inquiry team into the riots at Strangeways and elsewhere in 1990. Today the tensions in prison result in greater interpersonal violence, prisoner-on-prisoner and prisoner-on-staff. The dangers are as great, however, and the solutions remain the same. It is imperative that the prison population be significantly reduced. And it is to be hoped that the minister will consider closely the proposition that local authority consortiums (including mayors and PCCs) be given devolved custody budgets so as to follow the outstanding example of the youth custody sector to get short-term prisoners (particularly those with drug-related and mental health problems) into community-based projects as an alternative to imprisonment

• Last Tuesday’s tragic stabbings at Pentonville prison should shock us all to the core (Analysis: ‘Grimmest of the grim’ must shut, 20 October). It is unthinkable that we should now contemplate sending more people to Pentonville, or many other prisons like it, as part of a strategy to “boost the morale” of magistrates (MPs recommend extension of magistrates’ powers, theguardian.com, 19 October). The government’s promised white paper on prisons next month must signal an end to our 25-year love affair with imprisonment. Lives depend on it.

Laura Bates’ article (Extending anonymity to sexual crime suspects is a bad idea – here’s why, 18 October) misses the point. The naming of people on arrest rarely helps the investigation and frequently damages the reputations of people who are not subsequently charged.

I wrote the current police guidance on this matter, gave evidence to the Leveson inquiry and carried out the investigation into the South Yorkshire police handling of the search of Sir Cliff Richard’s apartment, and I was on the panel at the House of Lords last Monday with Sir Cliff Richard, Paul Gambaccini and Lady Brittan.

I believe that people should not be named on arrest save in exceptional circumstances: for example, where there is a threat to life, to prevent or detect crime or where there is some overriding public interest. Decisions on these matters should no longer be left to the police or the media but should go in front of a judge.

More than 40 female Labour MPs have written to the attorney general warning that women will be less likely to report rape because of the legal precedent set in the retrial of the footballer Ched Evans.

The members of the women’s parliamentary Labour party, including its chair, Jess Phillips, Harriet Harman and Angela Eagle, have urged Jeremy Wright to support a change in the law to stop a move towards the sexual history of rape complainants being used routinely to discredit their evidence in court.

They made the plea after evidence about the sexual history of the complainant was used in the retrial of Evans, a former Wales international who was acquitted earlier this month.

In the letter to Wright, they wrote that a move towards revisiting the sexual history of complainants in court would “act to make the prosecution of rape cases in the future harder and reporting of these crimes less likely”.

“The verdict and events in this case set a dangerous precedent that how a victim of rape, usually a woman, has behaved in the past can be taken as evidence of the way she behaved at the time of the alleged rape,” they wrote.

“This will deter victims from disclosing their abuse and will reduce the number of victims presenting their cases to the police for fear of having their private lives investigated and scrutinised.”

They said there was an additional risk that in an age of social media and online stalking, victims could fall prey to private investigations and the crowdsourcing of information into their past sexual partners.

“The ruling will act to encourage defence lawyers in rape trials to effectively apply for an individual’s completely legal and private sexual history to be admissible as evidence,” they said.

In the recent retrial of Evans, details about the sexual history of the complainant were used after appeal judges ruled the accounts were so similar to the alleged encounter with the footballer that it could not reasonably be explained as coincidental.

The MPs said the ruling created a precedent when such evidence had only previously been used once in the past 16 years in a case where the similarity of the sexual conduct was bizarre and unusual.

They are asking Wright and the justice secretary, Liz Truss, to change the law to specifically make it clear that sexual history evidence can only be used when the similar conduct is unusual and out of the ordinary.

Their arguments echo those of Vera Baird, the former solicitor general, who last week told Radio 4’s Today programme that the events of the case had set the law back decades when it comes to treatment of rape complainants’ sexual history.

“The only difference between a clear conviction of Mr Evans in 2012 and the absolute refusal of him having any leave to appeal at that time, and his acquittal now, is that he has called some men to throw discredit on [the woman’s] sexual reputation,” she said.

“That, I think, is pouring prejudice, which is exactly what used to happen before the law in 1999 stopped the admission of previous sexual history in order to show consent.”

To increase the pressure on the government, the MPs are demanding a meeting with Wright and the Ministry of Justice in order to discuss a change in the law or regulations.

“We must act to cease the return to a culture of ‘victim blaming’. We believe that the use of a complainants’ sexual history should never be used in our courts as evidence of consent,” they said.

“We are calling on the government to act. The women’s parliamentary Labour party ask that you and the minister of justice meet with a delegation from our group to discuss how the government will progress on this issue. We offer you our support in working towards a solution and promise our full scrutiny should this not be resolved.”

Phillips is also planning to raise the issue in the House of Commons at attorney general questions and call for a debate. She said the action was being taken by a united group of Labour women who have fought together to improve the lives of rape victims and protect women.

As director-general of fair trading in the 1980s and early 90s, Lord Borrie, who has died aged 85, was a key player in Margaret Thatcher’s attempts to attack cartels and make markets more competitive. However, his own political allegiance was with the left, and he was subsequently involved in Tony Blair’s New Labour project, becoming a Labour peer in 1995. He went on to supervise the advertising industry as chairman of the Advertising Standards Authority.

Borrie’s main impact lay in attacking cosy clubs that excluded outsiders and left the public paying more than they should for goods or services. His targets while at the Office of Fair Trading included the London Stock Exchange, the beer industry, estate agents and car dealers. But while he managed to stimulate change in such bastions of conservatism, the result was not always welcomed – beer prices rose rapidly after the “tie” between brewers and pubs was broken, while British firms on the stock exchange were soon swallowed by US and continental rivals. In confronting the City establishment by complaining that stock market practices restricted competition, he eventually ushered in the “Big Bang” deregulation that transformed London’s financial markets in the late 1980s.

Towards the end of his 16-year spell in office he became impatient with the constraints on his powers, and keen to move into the private sector. But he was enticed into the Labour fold, becoming a member of the Commission on Social Justice, which formulated the New Labour approach to social and economic policy in the mid-1990s. He also advised on competition policy, resulting in the creation of the Competition Commission after Labour came to power in 1997.

Born in Croydon, Gordon was one of five children of Alice and Stanley Borrie, a City solicitor. The family moved to north Wales at the start of the second world war, where Gordon went to John Bright grammar school in Llandudno. A bright student, he went to Manchester University at the age of 16 to study law. By that time he had developed a taste for politics and public speaking, sparked partly by Labour’s successful 1945 election campaign, which he followed enthusiastically.

At university he became chairman of the Labour club and, after graduation and national service in Korea, Labour candidate for Croydon Northeast at the age of only 23. He was defeated in the 1955 general election and four years later stood in Ilford South, again unsuccessfully. That was the end of his dalliance with parliament until he became a peer. His relationship with Labour was dormant for so many years not only because of his position as a senior civil servant, but also because of the party’s lurch to the left in the 1970s and 80s.

Borrie practised as a barrister for a few years after leaving university, but abandoned that in 1957 to become a lecturer, and published several books on the consumer and the law. Initially he worked at the Law Society’s College of Law, but moved to Birmingham University in 1965. He was made professor of English law in 1968 and stayed at the university until he was appointed director general of the OFT in 1976.

During this time he became a leading expert and author on consumer and competition law, and spent three years on the council of the Consumers’ Association in the 1970s. His job at the OFT was to identify, and tell ministers how to rectify, anti-competitive business and commercial practices.

This included advising on whether controversial takeovers should be investigated by the Monopolies Commission, which put him occasionally in the spotlight, especially during the long-running battle between Tiny Rowland and Mohamed Al Fayed for control of Harrods.

He demonstrated objectivity, persistence, charm and no little political skill in repeatedly challenging powerful industries such as beer and cement. However he had only limited success in attacking the protectionism of the professions, notably that of his own, law, although towards the end of his career he chaired the accountancy profession’s then supervisory body, the Accountancy Foundation. Thatcher gave him a knighthood in 1982, and he was made a QC in 1986.

After leaving the OFT, Borrie was a non-executive director of several companies, including the Woolwich Building Society, Mirror Group and the cable company Telewest. He continued to be active in public life well into his 70s, chairing the Advertising Standards Authority from 2001 until 2007 and serving on several other boards as well as being an active Labour peer.

He married Dorene (nee Toland) in 1960. She died in 2010.

When Gordon Brown made a touchingly phrased apology to Alan Turing in 2009 – “We’re sorry, you deserved so much better” – he regretted that he was unable to offer more: a posthumous pardon. “While Turing was dealt with under the law of the time and we can’t put the clock back,” he said, “his treatment was of course utterly unfair.”

This view was restated, in 2012, the centenary of Turing’s birth, by the coalition government’s Liberal Democrat justice minister, Lord McNally. He reminded 34,000 petitioners for a full pardon: “The law at that time required a prosecution and, as such, long-standing policy has been to accept that such convictions took place and, rather than trying to alter the historical context and to put right what cannot be put right, ensure instead that we never again return to those times.”

McNally, it turns out, was wrong (and not only about the strikingly unambitious alternative he adumbrated, of not going backwards). In 2013, to expressions of joy from subsequent justice minister, Chris Grayling, Turing was pardoned by the Queen. As of last week, posthumously offered pardons, for people who would be innocent of any crime today, have gone from being out of the question, to Labour policy, to a Tory manifesto commitment, to an official pledge from the current justice minister, Sam Gyimah.

Turing’s Law, an amendment to the policing and crime bill seems to mean that while living men must apply for “disregards” of their convictions in the defunct “gross indecency” category, a selected number of the dead will benefit from the government’s blanket, time-travelling pardon.

Selected, because the latter, while all eligible, presumably require the living to act for them. Unless volunteers start combing through court records to ensure that the innocent but obscure also get the benefit, it seems unlikely the dead will get to enjoy Turing’s Law on an equal basis. But since the pardons have only symbolic value, maybe it hardly matters if they end up restricted to the gloriously talented dead, the fashionable dead, dead subjects of successful biopics and those dead recently enough to benefit from concerned descendants. Assuming these various representatives can be sure about what their clients would have wanted.

You don’t have to read much of De Profundis to wonder how much an intervention by, say, Chris Grayling would have meant to Oscar Wilde, occupied with pitiless self-examination, if the former had stepped out of a Tardis into Reading Gaol, brandishing a copy of the 2015 Tory manifesto. “I surrounded myself with the smaller natures and the meaner minds,” Wilde writes. “I became the spendthrift of my own genius and to waste an eternal youth gave me a curious joy.”

Then again, posthumous pardons are entirely about the living and a pardon for Wilde, like a pardon for Turing, evidently has huge significance for many, though by no means all, of his admirers. If their abrupt adoption was perhaps less comprehensible by a Tory party whose members were, in the year of Turing’s pardon, still voting against same-sex marriage, perhaps it came about precisely because a posthumous pardon is, unlike one for the alive, an exercise in doing nothing.

The day after he extended, to long-dead victims of homophobia, the Tory party’s most tender consideration for their wellbeing, Sam Gyimah filibustered – or talked out – SNP MP John Nicolson’s Turing bill, which would have pardoned living people with the same convictions.

Coming soon, from the Tories’ new Department of the Departed: warm homes for dead rough sleepers, swingeing tax rises for the decomposing rich, a second EU referendum for much-mourned Remainers. Jam yesterday.

Admittedly, posthumous pardons were also dear to Ed Miliband. Supported by petitions and our more high-minded celebrities, they are, for the still numerous exponents of virtue-signalling, perhaps the ultimate gesture, better even than the Jane Austen tenner. They cost legislators nothing, mean nothing, commit them to nothing and are designed to improve only one thing – their reputations. Conversely, anyone who argues against this sprucing up of history, while living same-sex couples are jeered at for walking hand in hand, is at risk of looking less enlightened than the party containing Peter Bone.

It’s not impossible, of course, that the posthumous pardoning of Turing, then Wilde, (Joe Orton will just have to live with his sentence for library book defacement), along with thousands of the currently forgotten, will be quite the thing to improve life for anyone identifying as LGBT, particularly in communities where they are considered an abomination. That there might be more direct ways to address discrimination, and to alleviate the associated mental health problems outlined by Owen Jones last week, including approaches that do not exclude women (for whom historical persecution took less easily airbrushed forms), is no reason to leave Wilde’s conviction intact.

Less helpfully, if tasteful historical refurb catches on, Mr Gyimah may soon have to explain why representatives of individuals convicted of one particular no-longer-a-crime – gross indecency – should have a monopoly on posthumous pardons. If popular, his party’s legislative death cult may have to be extended to cover, say, people jailed for attempted suicide, for blasphemy and for witchcraft. The Labour MP Ben Bradshaw, for one, wants a pardon for the Exeter Three – the last women hanged for witchcraft in England, in 1682.

Should some sort of time limit seem sensible, in the light of Theresa May’s child sex abuse inquiry, the number of convictions under the 1604 statute against witchcraft does look to be relatively manageable. By way of a precedent, the state of Massachusetts thought it necessary – Arthur Miller not having made it clear enough in his play – to establish, in 2001, that five of the women hanged as witches in Salem were not, in fact, witches.

If these pardons did have value, the relevant dead people, or at least their descendants, would be at an advantage, you could argue, in becoming identifiably of interest, over the nameless millions with no criminal records, whose lives were ruined or destroyed in myriad ways less susceptible to retrospective contrition.

Then again, the dead gross-indecency demographic, in all its variousness, is now reduced to a convenient method of Tory-burnishing. Maybe, like George Montague, who appeared on Newsnight last week, they wouldn’t even thank Mr Gyimah for one of his pardons? An apology, he might accept. “I was not guilty of anything,” he said. “I was only guilty of being in the wrong place at the wrong time.”

An apology, however lame or pointless, would have the additional benefit of not rewriting history. Brown’s earlier “we’re sorry” statement contained some sense and humility. Turing was a genius. The idea that his CV, or for that matter, that of Oscar Wilde – “I was a man who stood in symbolic relations to the art and culture of my age” – needed an edit by the two stupidest governments in living memory is as vain as it is absurd.

The undead take on a central role in Prof He Jiahong’s extraordinary narratives of courtroom incompetence. They haunt the commanding certainties of the trial process and the execution yard.

But He is not a connoisseur of Halloween magic. As China’s leading authority on miscarriages of justice and the author of a series of detective novels, the 63-year-old former prosecutor and acclaimed academic has exposed heart-stopping flaws in judicial procedures.

His meticulous and engaging research exposed the infamous case of Teng Xingshan, who was executed in 1989 for murdering his mistress. Six years later Teng’s supposed victim, Shi Xiaorong, was discovered to be alive.

In another case documented in He’s latest book, Back from the Dead, She Xianglin was convicted of murdering his wife and imprisoned. Eleven years later, she reappeared in her native village, astonishing her family. In both cases, the verdicts were belatedly overturned.

At a time when nationalism is on the rise, He’s critique of a justice system on the opposite side of the world might seem like an esoteric diversion. But his ability to develop universal criminal justice lessons from forced confessions, the pressure of pubic opinion and misinterpretation of scientific evidence have chilling echoes in a country that jailed the Birmingham Six and the Guildford Four.

Only this year, the UK’s supreme court ruled that for the past 30 years British judges have been misconstruing crucial aspects of the joint enterprise guidelines, which may yet lead to scores, if not hundreds, of cases being reassessed and possibly retried.

Britain and China’s judiciaries, if not on the road to convergence, are sharing more and more legal experience through exchange visits and lectures. In May, Lord Neuberger, president of the UK’s supreme court, led a judicial delegation to Beijing. Prof He is an adviser to China’s supreme court and director of the Centre for Common Law in Beijing, which works in co-operation with the Great Britain-China Centre and the University of Oxford’s Faculty of Law.

In London this month to launch his book, He cuts a dapper figure in a neat blue suit, buttoned up at the neck. His English is crisp and fluent; his personal odyssey from agricultural labourer to pre-eminent legal scholar verges on the fantastical.

He was born in Beijing in 1953. During the cultural revolution he was sent to work on a farm. “I believed in communism,” he recalls. After a few years, though, he began to feel he had been fooled, and started writing a novel to prove he possessed talent. When he completed it, he was allowed to return to the capital, where he worked as a plumber. There he fell in love with a beautiful young woman. “She was a doctor; it was a very good job,” he says. Her parents tried to separate them.

They set up a challenge. “If I could pass a national exam for university … they would be happy to meet me. I had had only six years of education,” He recalls. “The examination was very competitive. I prepared for six months and passed.”

On enrolment at university, he randomly selected law. “I didn’t know [about it],” he admits. “Under the cultural revolution there was no law.” Two years later, after finishing his course in record time, he married his girlfriend. They have been together for 35 years, and have a daughter and a grandson.

He is an optimist. Accustomed to hard work on the farm, he believes the experience helped him power through academic challenges. “It’s not a bad thing for people to have hard lives and frustrations when they are young,” he says. Of the cultural revolution, he is less forgiving: “My second novel [published by Penguin] is entitled Black Holes. The cultural revolution was a black hole. It changed the lives of millions of people.”

The death penalty, real and fictional, has been a recurrent theme in He’s work. Eventually, he hopes, its use may cease. Opinion polls conducted in 2002, he says, showed public support for executions running at around 93% of the population. It was considered a natural part of Chinese culture.

“At the time, I said that we cannot abolish the death penalty. We have to respect public opinion. If you kill somebody then you should be killed. About 10 years later, I changed my mind,” he says. “Public opinion can be changed with education. More and more people think that [considering human rights] the death penalty is not a natural role for human beings.”

Around 2005, the Chinese authorities introduced a criminal justice reform known as the “kill fewer, kill carefully” reforms. In 2014, an amendment to the criminal law further reduced the number of offences that carry the death penalty.

Support for capital punishment is now around 70-80%, and coming down. He has advocated abolishing it gradually over the next two decades. “In fact, we may not abolish the death penalty [straight away],” he suggests. “We might not use it. We would wait and see; if we don’t use the death penalty for a number of years, then people in China would be persuaded. Then we may legally abolish the death penalty in 20 years. But it all depends on the situation … the government is facing the threat of terrorists [militant groups from within the separatist Muslim Uighur ethnic group] and drug trafficking.”

The number of executions is a state secret. Figures are disputed. While as many as 12,000 people might have been killed in 2002, according to the Dui Hua Foundation, a human rights campaign group, the annual total estimated by foreign observers is more than 1,000 deaths.

“We should not keep secret the numbers … policy has been changing in the supreme peoples’ court in China,” He says. “We should have stricter scrutiny of death penalties. We have to change the mentality of the decision makers. These wrongful convictions made [the authorities] have second thoughts.”

In 2007, the authorities decided to return to the supreme people’s court the power to review any death penalty. It had previously been entrusted to lower courts because there were too many cases for the supreme court to consider. Trafficking in the organs of those who have been executed has also been banned.

Twenty years ago, Back from the Dead could not have been published, He admits. “I started studying wrongful convictions in 2005. And at the time people thought it was wrong. It was difficult to have a dialogue openly in conferences at first.

“Chinese people would say: ‘We have some dirty things, but we should not let foreigners know.’ That was quite natural. But the leaders of the judiciary have had to accept that we must deal with the problem more openly, and that wrongful convictions can teach us lessons,” He says.

“It is not a matter of viewing police or prosecutors as evil gangs. Mistakes can be genuine errors. The problems have a positive role in provoking judicial reform. I point out the loopholes … perhaps other countries have better rules, but they still have miscarriages of justice one way or another. It’s a challenge for all human societies.”

In terror trials, He points out, there may be greater public demand to convict and to use torture on top of all the other pressures. Beatings were widely misused in the 1980s and 90s. “Now we have rules against torture. You can’t say it’s very good, but it’s better [at preventing] illegally obtained evidence,” he says. “And interrogations are videotaped. These things help to prevent torture.”

Earlier campaigns against corruption were handled by the party’s committees, which acted outside legal frameworks. “They ought to be restrained by criminal procedure law,” He says. Chinese water torture, he points out, was not devised by the Chinese; it is originally from Vietnam.

He practised as a defence lawyer for several years in the 1980s before transferring to academia. Inspiration for the first in his series of five detective novels, Hanging Devils, came from his research into miscarriages of justice. It is set on a state farm in a city in the north-east of China.

The book’s protagonist, Hing Jun, is a defence lawyer. “He has to travel up north to solve a wrongful conviction case. I had a problem with how to frame the story at first. In China at the time, defence lawyers had only seven days to prepare the trial. It would not have been enough time to collect all the evidence.

“Then we revised our criminal procedure so that defence lawyers would have two months to prepare a case [on appeal]. In 2012 we made further progress when the accused were given the right to a lawyer at the first investigation. Crime fiction is just a way to tell the story.”

What is happening in the article 50 court case?

Judgment is awaited on whether parliament or the government has authority to give formal notification under article 50 of the Treaty on the European Union of the UK’s intention to leave the EU. The government claims it is entitled to do so under the executive powers it has inherited from the crown under the royal prerogative.

How does this tie in with the article 50 case in Belfast?



A similar claim, which additionally stressed devolution law, has already been heard in the high court in Belfast. The 1998 Good Friday Agreement prevents Brexit being imposed on the people of Northern Ireland, Ronan Lavery QC told the court earlier this month. The former Northern Ireland justice minister, David Ford, nationalist and Green politicians have brought the claim. Judgment in that case is also awaited. Both claims, whichever way they go, are expected to be appealed directly to the UK’s supreme court in Westminster. A hearing, probably in front of at least nine justices, has been pencilled in for early December.

Who has brought the cases?



While attention has focused on the lead claimant in London, 51-year-old Gina Miller, a Guyanese-born and British-educated businesswoman, there are scores of other litigants and interveners. The second lead claimant there is Deir Dos Santos, a London hairdresser. Both Miller and Dos Santos are British citizens. Others funding the challenge include people living in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, British expatriates living in the EU, Gibraltarians worried about the future status of the Rock and the children of non-EU nationals. All worry that Brexit may deprive them of existing rights. Death threats have been made against claimants, prompting the judges to warn that those interfering with the case could be imprisoned for contempt of court.

If they win, could this stop Brexit?



Victory for the claimants would hand responsibility for triggering Brexit to MPs. Whether a majority would have the nerve to delay or defy the referendum result is unknown. Many, though personally committed remainers, may feel bound by the popular plebiscite. Other politicians might respect constituency pressures. Both the Scottish and Welsh devolved governments retained barristers on a watching brief at the London hearing. They could join the case at the supreme court, reinforcing legal opposition to Theresa May’s executive action.

How worried is the government?



It is difficult to predict the outcome of a case. The attorney general, Jeremy Wright QC, the government’s most senior legal adviser, led its team of lawyers in London to demonstrate political commitment to Brexit. The judges hearing the case include the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd, who at one point in the three-day hearing admitted that he was “slightly baffled” by government lawyers’ arguments. Sir Terence Etherton, the new Master of the Rolls, asked whether the fact that parliament had not specified the precise limits of the royal prerogative meant that “the government can remove common law rights?” The claimants have exploited the Bill of Rights 1689, a piece of legislation revered by Eurosceptics, pointing out that it “expressly prohibits the use of the prerogative in circumstances where its exercise would ‘suspend’ or ‘dispense’ statutory law”. The outcome is hanging in the balance.

If it goes to the supreme court, then what?



Technically, there could be an appeal to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg, the EU’s highest court, on a point of law. No one, however, wants the EU to decide on the limits of parliamentary sovereignty. If the supreme court rules against the government, parliament is likely to be given a vote on when, and possibly how, to trigger Brexit.

Miller, who is an investment manager, has been funding her claim. Much of the additional cash has come from various crowdfunding websites.

The prospects of an extended humanitarian ceasefire in eastern Aleppo have diminished after Russian diplomats stressed the Syrian government was entitled to eliminate all rebels in the city, and not just the 1,000 jihadi fighters linked to al-Qaida.



Russia has implemented a unilateral four-day ceasefire to allow humanitarian access, evacuation for the wounded and the safe passage of 1,000 Jabhat Fateh al-Sham fighters, the rebel group formerly known as al-Nusra, out of the besieged city.

The proposal is partly in line with a plan laid out by the UN special envoy, Staffan de Mistura, but neither Russia or Syria will agree to the second half of the plan – allowing the existing eastern Aleppo council to remain in power and halting attacks on non-jihadi fighters.

Russia believes there are as many as 6,000 rebels in eastern Aleppo, and only 1,000 are from Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, the organisation that has been labelled a terrorist group by Russia and the US. Russia insisted on Friday that all the fighters in eastern Aleppo should be classified as terrorists and must be eradicated.

On Thursday, De Mistura had urged Jabhat Fateh al-Sham to leave, but added that there had been no Syrian acceptance of the other element of his package – that the east Aleppo council would remain in political power and other armed opposition forces could stay in the city. The jihadi group has refused to leave.

Russia said that civilians were not leaving the city despite the humanitarian corridor, blaming sniper fire and threats by the opposition. It claimed members of the Ahrar al-Sham group, which is not proscribed by the US, had on Thursday publicly executed 14 local self-government officials who had called on people to leave the city’s eastern districts.

Moscow also announced it was extending its humanitarian ceasefire for a further 24 hours by allowing a further pause in the bombing from 8am to 7pm on Saturday.

So far the UN has said it has not been able to go into east Aleppo with supplies due to the lack of security assurances.

The Syrian government has been sending text messages to east Aleppo citizens claiming the rebels will use chemical weapons to defend themselves and calling the fighters cowards because they are hiding behind civilians.

Russia claimed a group of more than 1,200 rebels, including 30 suicide bombers, has been massed for an attack on Aleppo from the south-west. 



The militants have tanks, armoured vehicles and 20 pick-up trucks carrying large-calibre machineguns, Russian officials said.

On the diplomatic track, a UN human rights council meeting in special session in Geneva passed a resolution backing an independent investigation into the bombing of a UN convoy on 19 September and calling for a wider inquiry into human rights abuses in Aleppo.

The UK Foreign Office minister Tobias Ellwood, speaking at the council, said: “The actions of Assad and of Russia are driving radicalisation and fuelling terrorism, not tackling it. Russia: you are making the situation worse, not solving it.”



He told reporters that the Russian pause was “being used simply for them to regroup and further their own stranglehold over Aleppo”.

Referring to the airstrikes, he said: “This is shameful and it is not the action or leadership that we expect from a P5 [permanent member of the UN security council] nation.”

The United Nations’ top human rights official, Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein, also described the siege and bombing of eastern Aleppo as “crimes of historic proportions” that had caused heavy civilian casualties that amounted to war crimes.

Influential Labour MP Frank Field has said the “clock is ticking” against companies who exploit workers trapped in the gig economy.

On Thursday ministers ordered a crackdown on companies using large numbers of self-employed or agency workers following an investigation by the Guardian into low pay at the delivery company Hermes.

Field warned that other firms could now face scrutiny, revealing his office had been contacted by couriers working for other delivery companies airing similar grievances to those raised by Hermes workers.



“This is the beginning of what will be a long process of investigating this sort of exploitation,” said Field, adding that he was delighted with the speed with which Theresa May’s government had tackled the issue. “Compared with the last three governments this is rocket speed. We have had a period where employers have been testing the law and no one has been pushing back. This is the beginning of the pushback.”



From parcel carriers delivering packages to online shoppers, to app-driven services such as Uber and Deliveroo, the gig economy, which has transformed delivery services, relies on large networks of self-employed contractors. Their status means they are not entitled to earn the “national living wage” or receive benefits such as sickness and holiday pay.

The growing pressure comes as drivers for the taxi-app company Uber await an employment tribunal verdict on their claim that they should be classed as workers rather than as self-employed.

Since taking over as prime minister, May has talked about the need to “reform capitalism” and promised to improve the pay, security and employment rights of ordinary working people. She has also hired Matthew Taylor, the former head of Tony Blair’s policy unit, to head a review of workers’ rights and practices, which will try to address concerns that millions are stuck in insecure and stressful work.

Field wrote to May recently, asking her to examine a dossier of claims of false self-employment at Hermes. Scores of Hermes couriers’ testimonies revealed how their self-employment meant they received no paid holidays or sick pay – and in some cases were paid below the national living wage.

Field heard back this week from the financial secretary to the Treasury, Jane Ellison, who revealed that HM Revenue and Customs was establishing a specialist unit to investigate firms shirking employment obligations. In her letter she said the government was “committed to taking strong action where companies, to reduce their costs, force their staff down routes which deny them the employment rights and benefits they are entitled to”.

Field said the action showed May’s sentiment about “protecting the soft flesh of Britain’s underbelly” was beginning to take shape.



“The gig economy has made it too easy for companies to unthinkingly exploit large tracts of that soft underbelly,” said Field. “They have been able to offer any terms in gaining flexibility. Clearly that flexibility should have to be bought at a higher price. I think these practices exist because companies could get away with it and now we are testing the law and HMRC rules. If they are found wanting I would expect HMRC to change them.”

In a separate response, Edward Troup, the executive chairman of HMRC, said the Hermes dossier supplied by Field had been referred to the “appropriate compliance teams” for consideration. Troup said confidentiality prevented him from commenting on the tax affairs of individual companies but he fired a warning shot to unscrupulous employers: “Individuals cannot be opted out of employment rights and protections simply by calling them ‘self-employed’. We are committed to tackling false self-employment.

“If we find that companies have misclassified individuals as self-employed, we will take all necessary steps to make sure that they pay the appropriate tax, NICs, interest and penalties.”

In a recent case, agency workers at Sports Direct’s warehouse in Derbyshire were awarded £1m in back pay after it emerged that they had been paid below the minimum wage.

Field said he would be pressing HMRC for an update before Christmas – the busiest time of the year for courier firms. “If we haven’t got a timetable I will be putting pressure on them for one,” he said. “I would like to see them report back before Christmas because if you are being sweated, everyday is a horror.”

A seven-year-old boy who was “living life entirely as a girl” has been removed from his mother’s care after a ruling by a high court judge.

Mr Justice Hayden said the woman had caused her son “significant emotional harm”, and he criticised local authority social services staff responsible for the youngster’s welfare.

The judge said the woman had been “absolutely convinced” the youngster “perceived himself as a girl” and was determined that he should be a girl. He said the boy was now living with his father, who is separated from the woman. The youngster still saw his mother.

Hayden said “flares of concern” had been sent from a “whole raft of multi-disciplinary agencies”, and he could not understand why so many concerns had been “disregarded so summarily” by social services staff.

The judge said social services staff had “moved into wholesale acceptance that [the boy] should be regarded as a girl”. He said he wanted the council to undertake a review of the “social work response” to the case. A council spokesperson said bosses had already begun a review.

Details of the case emerged on Friday in a ruling by the judge after private hearings in the family division of the high court in London.

Hayden said no one involved in the case – including the local authority – could be identified. The judge also barred the woman from revealing specifics of the case in any media interviews. He said he was afraid that an information jigsaw could be created that might lead to the boy’s identity being revealed.

The judge said he had analysed evidence from the boy’s parents, local authority social workers and a psychologist. He indicated the boy’s parents had separated some years ago. The boy had stayed with his mother.

Family court litigation had started about three years ago after the father raised concerns about not having contact with his son. A lower-ranking judge had authorised a “wide-ranging” inquiry and local authority social services staff had begun investigations.

The boy’s mother “told me that [he] was ‘living in stealth’ by which was meant, she explained, that he was living life entirely as a girl”, said Hayden. “He dressed, at all times, like a girl and, it transpired, had been registered at a new general practitioner’s as a girl.”

The judge added: “I was also left in no doubt that [the mother] was absolutely convinced that [the boy] perceived himself as a girl.” Hayden said his “overwhelming impression” was that the woman “believes herself to be to fighting for [her son’s] right to express himself as a girl”.

He said the woman had told him that the boy “expressed disdain for his penis”. He added: “I consider that [the mother] has caused significant emotional harm to [her son] in her active determination that he should be a girl.”

Hayden said the boy had settled well in the care of his father and his father’s partner. “I have been told that [the father] and his partner were shocked when they first saw [the boy] by the extent to which he appeared to be a girl, both in appearance and in mannerism,” said the judge. “However, what is striking is how well [the boy] has settled down.”

The judge added: “I have noted from reports that the boy] has become interested in Power Rangers, SpongeBob, superheroes and is constantly finding new interests … It is striking that most of [the boy’s] interests are male-oriented.

“I am entirely satisfied, both on the basis of the reports and [the father’s] evidence at this hearing, that he has brought no pressure on (the boy) to pursue masculine interests. [The boy’s] interests and energy are entirely self-motivated.”

A Mississippi woman is appealing a district court’s ruling that her nearly 100-day incarceration in a county jail, without being offered bail or an attorney, did not violate her civil rights.

The ruling, handed down by district judge Sharion Aycock last month, outlines a little known gap in constitutional law that in certain scenarios can lead to extremely long pre-trial detention periods for minor crimes, for no compelling reason.

Despite the fact that the woman, 34-year-old Jessica Jauch, was only accused of the sale of a small quantity of prescription drugs, county officials held her for more than three months due to the county’s own scheduling convenience, as the criminal court was out of session at the time of her arrest.

Aycock’s ruling that this was not a violation of her rights has deeply troubled civil liberties activists and scholars, who are now looking to use the case to highlight some of the most unfair and under-discussed practices of the criminal justice system.



“The supreme court has never specifically said, this is the amount of time the court has to provide a prompt bail hearing,” said Brandon Buskey, a senior staff attorney at the Criminal Law Reform Project of the ACLU.

“It’s kind of this void where the states can make up their own rules. But one would think that the time to have a prompt bail hearing is prior to three months after they’ve been taken into custody,” Buskey said.

Jauch was arrested for misdemeanor traffic offenses in Starkville, Mississippi, in April of 2012. Shortly after her arrest, authorities located a felony drug warrant for Jauch out of Choctaw County, one county over from where she had been picked up, and transferred her to the custody of the sheriff there.

According to Jauch’s court filings, from the moment she was transferred to the Choctaw County jail, she asserted her innocence to anyone who would listen, and asked to be taken before a judge so she could post bail. The county sheriff, Cloyd Halford, allegedly told Jauch and her friend that he did not have to take Jauch before a judge until the next court term, which was about three months away. At no point during this time was Jauch provided an attorney.

The warrant Jauch was being held for was issued over an alleged drug sale of eight tablets of alprazolam, a commonly prescribed anti-anxiety drug widely known by its trade name, Xanax. An informant told prosecutors that Jauch had sold her the tablets for $40, and prosecutors managed to secure a grand jury indictment for Jauch, likely based on this testimony, although it can’t be sure exactly what evidence jurors heard, as grand jury proceedings are confidential in the US.

Prosecutors also stressed that videotape existed of the transaction which clearly showed the transaction.

Sheriff Halford allegedly told Jauch’s mother that they had her daughter “dead to rights” committing the crime on video “and that she was going to prison for a long time and was a terrible person”, according to Jauch’s complaint.

But once Jauch was finally taken to court, 96 days later, the state’s case utterly crumbled. Her newly appointed counsel watched the videotape and found that it depicted no such crime, and in fact merely showed Jauch borrowing $40 from a friend. That friend, who was the state’s confidential informant, had, as the complaint alleges, “used her own narcotic pain pills to frame Ms Jauch in order to gain leniency for her own crimes”.

After Jauch’s attorney brought the contents of the tape to the prosecutor, the charges were promptly dropped.

While the failure of prosecutors to either watch or disclose the contents of the video is troubling, none of the facts of the failed indictment are particularly novel. Prosecutors routinely secure shaky indictments of suspects that are later dropped. But for Jauch, this bad indictment meant losing three months of her life without even being offered the possibility to secure a pre-trial release, a right that Jauch’s suit against the county claimed are guaranteed by the fourth, sixth, eighth and 14th amendments to the constitution.

But Aycock, the district judge, dismissed those claims one by one in her decision. She argued, among other things, that because Jauch was indicted by a grand jury she lost her right to a probable cause hearing under Mississippi law. Typically these hearings happen during the initial appearance before a judge when someone is arrested, and also include the setting of bail.

But just because Jauch had lost her right to the former, Buskey said, it doesn’t have anything to do with the latter. The first part “only answers the question of whether the initial custody was lawful”, Buskey said. “In order to fully address this case you have to get at, how long is it legal to hold somebody before or after indictment without any kind of court process.”

Alec Karakatsanis, executive director of the Civil Rights Corps, said he thinks case law is on Jauch’s side, citing language in the case of US v Salerno that declared access to pre-trial liberty a “fundamental right”.

“Once you call something fundamental right, if the government wants to infringe that right, it has to meet strict scrutiny,” Karakatsanis said. “There’s absolutely no way that delaying [a bail hearing] more than a few days is going to be a narrowly tailored way of furthering any compelling government interest.”

Karakatsanis added that for all the problems Jauch’s case raises, the fact is that many more Americans who are given bail hearings are still held in the same unnecessary limbo by being offered bail so high they simply cannot pay.

“The deeper problem is that when people get those bail hearings, they’re often meaningless because they are unaffordable,” Karakatsanis said. “This is all just indicative of a system that is indifferent to the horrific harm caused by locking people in cages.”

Senior managers at a privately run children’s jail received bonuses this year despite the prison being taken out of their hands following allegations of abuse.



The managers received performance-related pay awards in April, weeks after the chief inspector of prisons said that “managerial oversight failed to protect young people from harm at the jail”. Eight former staff currently face criminal charges.

In January, the BBC’s Panorama programme showed an undercover reporter working as a guard at the G4S-run Medway secure training centre (STC) in Kent. The film showed children allegedly being mistreated and claimed that staff falsified records of violent incidents. No senior managers were disciplined or dismissed.

In February, a Guardian investigation revealed that, in 2003, whistleblowers had warned G4S, the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) and the Youth Justice Board (YJB) that staff were mistreating detained children. Their letter, sent by Prof John Pitts, an expert on youth justice, was ignored.

Just before the Panorama programme was broadcast, the YJB, which oversees youth custody in England, stopped placing children in Medway.

Also in January, the prisons inspectorate carried out a snap inspection of Medway. Inspectors reported that a small group of detainees said some staff used insulting, aggressive or racist language and that they felt unsafe in areas not covered by CCTV.

Inspectors said the concerns raised were consistent with evidence presented by Panorama “which showed targeted bullying of vulnerable boys by a small number of staff”.

They added: “A larger group of staff must have been aware of unacceptable practice but did not challenge or report this behaviour.”

In an earlier Ofsted report on Medway, inspectors said staff and middle managers reported feeling a lack of leadership and having “low, or no confidence in senior managers”.

The then chief inspector of prisons, Nick Hardwick, said: “Managerial oversight failed to protect young people from harm. Effective oversight is key to creating a positive culture that prevents poor practice happening and ensuring it is reported when it does.”

The Guardian has learned that senior managers at Medway received performance-related pay awards in April amounting to between 10-25% of their annual salaries, according to seniority.

In February, G4S announced their intention to sell off their UK children’s services arm of the business, including two secure training centres. In May, the MoJ said the National Offender Management Service would take over the running of Medway. In July, Noms formally took control of the STC.

Lela Xhemajli was detained at Medway in 2009, aged 15. She says she was unlawfully restrained numerous times in the 18 months she spent at the STC, including one occasion in which her face was repeatedly slammed into icy ground. Now in employment, having “turned [her] life around”, she says she was angry when she heard about the pay awards to managers.

“I assumed the senior management team would be sacked after what was revealed in the investigations. But now it looks like they have been rewarded for allowing children to be abused in prison on their watch,” she said.

Former Labour MP Sally Keeble, who has highlighted alleged G4S abuses in children’s secure training centres for more than a decade, said: “This is people making personal profit out of tragedy, and it is completely unacceptable. Given the government’s expressed concern about the need to protect vulnerable young people, I would hope that justice minister Liz Truss would intervene and make sure these bonuses are not being paid by a Ministry of Justice contractor.”

A spokesman for G4s confirmed that no senior managers at Medway were disciplined or dismissed following the Panorama and Guardian investigations. He said two duty operational managers had been dismissed.

The spokesman said: “Four people working at Medway were eligible for performance related pay this year under a mix of personal [non-financial] and financial objectives. One received no payment and the remaining three received reduced payments, based on elements of personal and financial performance.”

The MoJ declined to comment, saying the pay awards were a matter for G4S.

Labour MP Chris Bryant holds back tears as he urges the government to go further in pardoning gay men convicted of now-abolished sexual offences. Speaking in the Commons on Friday, he argues that the bill should remember a group of gay MPs from the 1930s: Ronald Cartland, Jack Macnamara, Anthony Muirhead, Robert Bernays and Victor Cazalet
###########################################################
A Conservative minister has scuppered the progress of a new law to pardon all gay and bisexual men in England and Wales historically convicted of sexual offences that are no longer criminal.

The legislation, put forward by John Nicolson of the SNP, failed to pass to its next stage in the House of Commons after an emotional debate that brought former Labour minister Chris Bryant close to tears.

Nicolson’s bill would have given an automatic pardon to men convicted under the obsolete laws relating to gross indecency with other men. It would go further than an amendment to the policing and crime bill proposed by the government, which only pardons the thousands of men who are already dead, while the living will have to apply to the Home Office to get their convictions overturned.

However, Sam Gyimah, a justice minister, ensured the bill could not go forward on Friday because he spoke for so long that it ran out of time. He argued that the bill did not give strong enough protections against men being accidentally pardoned for sex with a minor or non-consensual sex.

An attempt by the SNP to force a vote was unsuccessful because there were not the requisite 100 MPs in the House of Commons. Debate on the bill is set to resume on 16 December but it is unlikely to progress without the support of the government.

Ministers announced earlier this week that about 40,000 dead people will be pardoned, three years after a posthumous pardon was issued to the second world war codebreaker Alan Turing for the offence of gross indecency.

But out of the 65,000 men convicted under the abolished laws, about 15,000 are still alive and will have to go through an administrative process in order to obtain a pardon.

Bryant, the former shadow leader of the House of Commons, fought back tears in parliament as he said it was not good enough for the government to automatically pardon those who are deceased while requiring the living to apply to the Home Office.

“Why on earth would you want to write to the home secretary and say, ‘Please can I be pardoned’?” he asked. “Why on earth would you want to go through a process all over again? Why on earth would you want someone to analyse whether or not you were guilty at all way back when?”

Speaking in parliament, Bryant recalled a group of gay and bisexual MPs who opposed the appeasement of Adolf Hitler in the 1930s, but were bullied by the government of the day and branded the “glamour boys”. He said they and others should receive “something that feels like an apology”.

Crispin Blunt, the Conservative former justice minister, also warned that the government’s proposals do not have the desired “symbolic effect”, while Nigel Adams, another Tory MP, labelled the behaviour of ministers as “a little bit slippery”.

Wes Streeting, a Labour MP, shouted “outrageous” as Gyimah made his arguments and later tweeted that the minister had “come to work to block a bill to deliver justice for people imprisoned and chemically castrated for being gay – what a guy”.

Nicolson said his bill would “provide a blanket pardon for any gay man convicted of a crime which is no longer a crime”.

“The meaning of that is patently obvious,” he said. “If the crime for which you were convicted is still a crime, by definition you are not pardoned,” he said. “So let nobody be confused about that. The aim of this simple measure is, I hope, obvious.

“The pardon confers no immediate advantage except this: it will, I hope, bring closure to those men who have had those monstrous, unfair criminal convictions for decades.”

But Gyimah, a government minister, said: “As well as honouring the dead, [the Nicolson bill] seeks a pardon for the living. We have developed a way to do this without giving any perception that the pardon covers perpetrators of sex with a minor or non-consensual sex.

“What I would like to do today [Friday] is to make a full and open offer to the honourable member to work with officials in the Ministry of Justice and the Home Office and [the gay rights group] Stonewall to give real effect to this pardon for the dead and the living as fairly and quickly as possible.”

The government has announced it will pardon men convicted of having sex with other men. These men were convicted of crimes that couldn’t apply to men and women having sex with one another or women having sex together. They were crimes that only consenting adult men could commit. It’s a welcome development – even men who have died will receive a pardon; but does pardoning those men unlucky enough to get caught actually address the trauma to which the British state subjected LGBT people?

For centuries, LGBT people have been hounded in this country, but in the 20th century the full force of the state was used against homosexual men. Lesbians weren’t the victims of the criminal law, but they fared little better. The concept of a trans identity was simply rejected.

We were all despised.

I grew up in rural Devon in the 1970s, a gay kid at a local comprehensive. This was England, and even though homosexuality had been partially decriminalised the decade before, England remained a very hostile place to be gay. Homophobia was the norm. It was so normal, there wasn’t a word for it then.

In myself, I didn’t mind who I was, but I knew others did and that I couldn’t be known to be gay. There would be too many consequences. There was always the risk of violence, physical or verbal. They called me “poof”. How could they tell? I lived in genuine fear of being found out. My sexuality had to be stifled.

Of course, as I entered my late teens random sexual fumbling occurred; casual encounters with strangers. I told no one. On one level I was ashamed, but I adapted. I grew to relish the taboo. I had no idea that I was committing criminal offences. Homosexuality may have been partially decriminalised in 1967, but only if you were over 21 and the sex took place in private. I was under 21, and was not protected by the law. I still remember a few years later meeting a 19-year-old who’d been convicted of gross indecency. At least he can be pardoned now.

And then along came Aids. I went into a genuine state of anxiety. I could tell no one about it. Like so many young gay men of my generation, my future was shadowed by the spectre of Aids.

The story that I have just told will resonate with gay and lesbian people who are now 40-plus. From a tender age we learned to cope, to avoid, to control. Can bullying be managed? With so little experience of life, how do you avoid violence and the fear of it? How do you deal with rejection? And as for yearning, how is that suppressed?

In the years that followed 1967 the number of convictions for gross indecency, an offence that could only be committed by consenting gay men, doubled. Prosecutions peaked in the 1980s. Between 1967 and 2003, when the gross indecency law was finally consigned to history, it is believed that there were up to 35,000 convictions, although actual figures are unclear.

There was also something remarkably naive about the 1967 act. It didn’t address the reality of most gay men, for whom finding a private space was a near impossibility. How could they bring sexual partners home to their parents or wives?

So is the abuse of the LGBT community an unfortunate accident of history? Like apartheid, criminalising gay men distorted everything and its poison permeated every aspect of life. Who was not complicit in the torment of the LGBT community? By pursuing gay men, did the UK end up with a sexual offences regime that was not fit for purpose and that could be easily manipulated by others, which in turn left the most vulnerable exposed?

And what about Aids? Did the pre-existing and ongoing persecution of gay men exacerbate the crisis? To what extent were safe sex messages for gay men hampered because in the early years of the Aids crisis there was no experience of dealing with this widely criminalised underclass?

We all lost too many to Aids. None of us were equipped or prepared. Our anger and sadness will always live with us. But was our loss intensified by those who should have protected us? Why in the midst of the Aids crisis, for example, did the government introduce legislation banning the so-called promotion of homosexuality? At a time when we most needed the pastoral care of the state, it turned on us and magnified our pain.

My story is just one of many. We now live in a world that is unrecognisable to that in which I came of age. But should we feel resentment and anger that our generation and the countless generations before us were subjected to treatment that, if meted out to others, would be described as persecution?

British government policy relating to LGBT people destroyed lives. We may still be living with the mental health consequences of those policies, and if you take just one issue, LGBT suicide, its full extent has never been acknowledged. We also know there is extensive alcohol and drug addiction within the LGBT community. We are entitled to question why this is, and we deserve answers.

Pardoning those who were convicted for seeking intimacy is a decent gesture, but it is only a gesture and gives no answers, explanations or real remedies. Nor does it capture the experience of every single one of us. The state made us outsiders, and for many this included being an outsider from their families – those they loved the most. The human spirit is indomitable, and the LGBT spirit is no less so. We survived, but that doesn’t mean we aren’t entitled to the truth, to have our stories heard and to a fully reasoned explanation and apology for our persecution. We need more than pardons for those convicted. What’s needed is an independent investigation in to how the British state could have treated us as it did.

Mazher Mahmood is set to spend seven or so months in jail and some will say justice has been done. In fact, it is only a partial justice.

As he starts his 15-month sentence, deeper questions should now be asked of an employer that enabled him to wreck so many people’s lives.

News International (since rebranded as News UK) spent years ignoring every warning sign about Mahmood’s dodgy form of investigative journalism. 



For the self-styled Fake Sheikh was in fact a fake journalist. He invented stories, lured unsuspecting people into his traps and then “exposed” them as wrongdoers.

Yet his editors could not be other than aware that many of his exclusives turned out to be anything but as straightforward as his copy suggested.

On several occasions, when his stories were examined in courtrooms, jurors realised the truth: he had induced people to commit crimes they would never have done without his encouragement.

Some were fragile, especially the many immigrants who formed so many of his targets. Some were offered disproportionate inducements. Some were innocents easily bamboozled by his cunning plans.



What is so baffling is that in the course of the 20-plus years he worked for three News International titles - News of the World, Sunday Times and Sun on Sunday - the editors and managers failed to appreciate that fact.

Did they not have pause for thought when a jury asked to convict the Earl of Hardwicke on a drugs charge in 1999 sent a note to the judge saying they wouldn’t have convicted him had they been allowed to take Mahmood’s extreme provocation into account?

Were their suspicions not aroused by high-profile courtroom reverses? There was the collapse of one involving five men accused of plotting to kidnap Victoria Beckham in 2002. One of the men later successfully sued the paper for libel. Did that not give News International pause for thought?

Another case involved three men prosecuted in 2006 for buying a non-existent substance, “red mercury”, in order to build a non-existent “dirty bomb”. They were cleared.

In both cases, there were complaints from lawyers about Mahmood’s investigative methodology, which included the use of agents provocateur.

But these cases came relatively late in Mahmood’s employment by News International. What is truly extraordinary is that he worked for the company at all after his first spell as a Sunday Times reporter in the late 1980s, when he left under a cloud after tampering with the main-frame computer in order to cover up a mistake.

It amazed Sunday Times executives that, after such an act of dishonesty, he was able to return to the Wapping complex after just a couple of years to take up a job with the News of the World.

In his new post, he quickly set about creating a special position for himself, working outside of the normal chain of command. A succession of editors turned a blind eye to his unorthodox methods because he provided the paper with a string of scoops.

He was allowed to build his own team of helpers and to spend lavishly in order to invent scenarios that helped him to entrap people. He was able to fly people across the world, book luxury hotels, ply people with champagne and create fake websites.

To do so, he drew on the vast resources of one of the world’s major media companies, Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation. When judges and lawyers complained about his activities, that company defended him at every turn.

It spared no funds in providing him with his legal defence following the collapse of the Tulisa Contostavlos case and his prosecution for conspiring to pervert the cause of justice. It also kept him on full pay when he was remanded before trial.

But News Corp has not not been Mahmood’s only defender. The Metropolitan police have a lot to answer for down the years.

They have often worked hand in glove with Mahmood, especially over the Beckham kidnap and red mercury cases. When one of Mahmood’s “assistants”, Florim Gashi, decided to tell the truth about Mahmood’s methods, police officers flew to Croatia to interview him.

It appeared that, at last, Scotland Yard was taking complaints about Mahmood seriously, as the Guardian reported in 2005. That investigation came to nothing because officers decided there was insufficient evidence to substantiate the allegations.

Even so, it should have been a warning that there was something nasty in the News of the World woodshed. Instead, as with the phone-hacking scandal, the link between News International and Scotland Yard remained tight.

Note also how Mahmood’s relationship with his employers survived the closure of the News of the World after the hacking scandal broke in 2011.

By that time he had broken the story of the Pakistani cricketers involved in so-called “spot fixing” during matches. It was regarded as his greatest public interest story.

Although the overwhelming majority of the paper’s staff were fired, Mahmood was retained and placed back on the Sunday Times, to the intense irritation of several staff members who knew the circumstances of his 1988 departure.

It was only a brief return. Once Murdoch launched the Sun on Sunday, Mahmood was transferred to that title and it was there he delivered the Contostavlos story that was to prove his downfall.



When he was convicted, a News UK spokesperson said the company was “disappointed by the news”. You bet it was. Disappointed to have been found out, yet again, as employing a law-breaking journalist.

The Ministry of Justice plans to pardon gay and bisexual men convicted of sexual offences that are no longer illegal. In a symbolic gesture, the MoJ said there would be no historical limit in relation to past offences – with those convicted set to be exonerated. Our readers have had their say on this issue.



Public acknowledgement that these laws were wrong is great, but I believe many are also owed an apology. I was born in the 1960s when sex between men was still illegal. The law may have changed in 1967 but attitudes did not, and I experienced homophobia all through childhood. It destroyed my confidence and ideas about myself. There was a real hangover of hate from that appalling law. 



So as a young man I was deeply affected by the fact people were allowed to hate me for being gay. If they could hate me for something I couldn’t change, I decided I would hate them right back. I devoted myself to gay filmmaking, which is what I do now and much of my work is very confrontational. Therefore I think that as well as pardoning gay men who are now dead, many people still living are owed an apology for the impact of anti-gay laws. 



Alan Turing, the gay mathematician who killed himself following his conviction for gross indecency, is an important person to remember but there are lots of other ordinary men who had their lives ruined. The horror and shame continued well into the 1960s and 1970s and it was only really the 1980s when gay men became more visible. It took 20 years for people to realise that it’s not OK to be homophobic. So yes an apology from the government is needed because there were many people let down by these laws.

This should have happened decades ago, but I’m pleased to see it now. Of course it cannot compensate for the years of pain and stigma, let alone the actual bodily harm done through techniques such as chemical castration, which Alan Turing was subjected to, but it’s a half win. 



While it is a step in the right direction, it does no good for those who are already deceased, and lacks the compensation for those who are still living. Homosexual acts between men may have been decriminalised in 1967, but the age of consent was not equalised until the beginning of this century. So it wasn’t lowered to 18 until 1994, and finally 16 in England and Scotland in 2000. There are relatively young men who have been deeply affected by this: put on child abuse registers, carrying around sex offender records, serving time in prison. 



The pardoning of people is a start, but it does nothing to amend the damage done by those convictions. Maybe nothing can.

I’m a gay man who thinks it’s wrong to issue a pardon. A pardon is forgiveness for an error or offence, the only offence here was by the UK government and so the idea of being “forgiven” by them is highly offensive. After the Conservatives managed to dispel their “nasty party” image through the legalisation of same sex-marriage (despite a majority of them voting against) they seem to be going back to tried-and-tested methods and are using us as pawns once again to distract from their seemingly total destruction of the UK. I don’t have any historic convictions, nor do I know anyone who does, but this ruling affects all gay men – in that it sets the tone that we are helpless and grateful subjects of a forgiving Tory government.

A pardon feels like it’s a gift rather than a necessity. The message should be that the crime no longer exists and these people are innocent. This would be how I prefer it to be done. It still feels like it’s in the realm of – “you have offended, but we forgive you”. It’s strange to offer a pardon when nothing has been done wrong. Pardoning is a problematic word, so maybe the way this has been approached is wrong.

You could argue, what is the point in pardoning people who are dead and buried? What difference does that make? Other than make the nation feel better. I might not be gay but I believe it sends out a positive message. It might be a good way to move forward. Alan Turing was wrongfully punished and a posthumous pardon brings this to people’s attention. It is a more significant move for the people who have a negative perception of homosexuality. It might make them think twice about their prejudice. If anything I hope it benefits society as a whole and these tiny little steps forwards are very positive in overcoming prejudice of any description.

South Africa says it is pulling out of the international criminal court, making the country the second this week, after Burundi, to move to leave the tribunal that pursues the world’s worst atrocities.

The ICC’s obligations are inconsistent with domestic laws giving sitting leaders diplomatic immunity, the country’s justice minister, Michael Masutha, said.

Pretoria said last year it planned to leave the ICC after receiving criticism for ignoring a court order to arrest the visiting Sudanese president, Omar Hassan al-Bashir, who is accused of genocide and war crimes. Bashir has denied the accusations.

On Friday at a press conference in the capital, Masutha said: “The implementation of the Rome statute of the International Criminal Court Act 2002 is in conflict and inconsistent with the provisions of the Diplomatic Immunities and Privileges Act 2001.”

Under the Rome statute, countries have a legal obligation to arrest anyone sought by the tribunal. Any move to leave would take effect one year after notice is formally received by the United Nations secretary general, currently Ban Ki-moon.

Earlier on Friday, the public broadcaster SABC published a document outlining the withdrawal plan.

The document was signed by South Africa’s minister of international relations and cooperation, Maite Nkoana-Mashabane, and dated 19 October.

“The Republic of South Africa has found that its obligations with respect to the peaceful resolution of conflicts at times are incompatible with the interpretation given by the international criminal court,” the document states.

The international criminal court opened in July 2002 and has 124 member states. It was the first legal body with permanent international jurisdiction to prosecute genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.



Burundi appeared set to become first state to withdraw from the Rome statute, the 1998 treaty establishing the global court, after its parliament voted last week to leave. The president, Pierre Nkurunziza, signed a decree on Tuesday, but the UN has not yet been officially notified.

Several African countries have expressed concern that the focus of the Hague-based court has been on Africa rather than elsewhere in the world.



Human Rights Watch said: “South Africa’s proposed withdrawal from the international criminal court shows startling disregard for justice from a country long seen as a global leader on accountability for victims of the gravest crimes.”

Barring fog, storms or runway protests at London City airport, this morning we will fly from London to the Isle of Man to become the first heterosexual couple living in the UK to enter into a civil partnership in the British Isles. Unfortunately this option is not open to us in the UK.

The Isle of Man is a crown dependency but not actually in the UK, so can make its own laws. And this new law is one we like. In July, this small island of some 90,000 people, best known for its annual TT motorbike race and snub-tailed cats, zoomed into the lead in the race for social equality.

It matched the UK by legalising marriage for same-sex couples, but also changed its laws to allow different-sex couples to formalise their union in civil partnerships.

Consider that homosexual activity was still illegal in the Isle of Man until the 1990s, and you see how fast has been its path to progressive legislation.

As things stand, our civil partnership will not be recognised on mainland Britain. But it’s a start. Since the introduction of civil partnerships for same-sex couples in the UK in 2004, we’ve been interested in finding an alternative legal grounding to formalise our long relationship. But like many, we were disappointed to discover that couples in our situation were excluded by law. Even when David Cameron’s government brought in same-sex marriage, it didn’t equalise the law to allow different-sex civil partnership; wedded as the then PM was to the pre-eminence of marriage.

This anomaly is being challenged, though. On 2 November a brave and principled couple, Rebecca Steinfeld and Charles Keidan, will appear in the court of appeal. Their case is that in insisting that civil partners “must be of the same sex”, the government is in contravention of the Human Rights Act. They are the trailblazers for Equal Civil Partnerships, a movement we support, including its fundraising efforts to mount a proper campaign for a change of law in the UK.

So when the Isle of Man did what the UK has so far failed to do, we jumped at the chance to take advantage of its more progressive legislation. We made our first trip to the island earlier this month to apply in person.

We discovered that if you are UK residents, you are not allowed to just stay on the island the night before your appointment – but hanging around on the island for eight days while the licence is granted is fine. Maybe the island’s tourist office will be offering eight-day “all-inclusive” civil partnership holidays soon.

Apart from that, and the hassle of finding a paper-based proof of our address in an age of digital banking, applying was straightforward. Happily the sun shone, the air was fresh and we found the Manx people to be warm and friendly. With stage one complete, we’re now setting out to complete stage two: the official legal undertaking, which involves a simple ceremony and form-signing in the registry in Douglas.

But why not just get married? Why should we? After all, with two children aged over 10, a dog, a mortgage, 24 years of living together and dozens of rows, we feel we’ve pretty much worked out how to be a “happily unmarried” couple, and we don’t see why we need to fall in with an archaic institution to validate our relationship. We aren’t acting on impulse or a whim. Neither is this a “halfway house” to marriage, let alone a way round the UK’s tax laws, which discriminate against us cohabiting unmarrieds.

But we do crave legal recognition, and the family rights and protections afforded to conventionally married couples (of any gender combination). For instance, even now, Martin (as an unmarried father) cannot assume automatic parental responsibility for our older child as the teenager was born before a law-change eradicated this sniffy piece of anti-male bias, discovered with hair-pulling horror after queueing for hours for a replacement passport for the child two years ago. But having nailed our colours to the mast, it would be almost disrespectful to shrug our shoulders and get conventionally hitched for legal and financial reasons.

For us, the concept of “marriage” comes with social and cultural references that just don’t fit how we see ourselves or our partnership. Ironically, on our first visit to the Isle of Man to register our interest in a civil partnership, we were asked whether Claire was going to be “given away” as part of the civil service, as is traditional in many marriage ceremonies: exactly the sort of historical baggage we’re trying to avoid.

Our relationship, after a quarter of a century, is based on love, friendship and true partnership. We respect those people who want to get married. But these marriages don’t all end happily ever after. We’ve seen friends meet, date, marry and divorce in a fraction of the time we have held our relationship together with just love, understanding, country walks, bolshy kids and mortgage payments. We have proved that our form of relationship is as enduring as many a marriage. All we need is legal recognition. The rest we can manage ourselves.

The Instagram posts of takeaway coffee cups that nearly forced a mistrial in the Tinder murder case have highlighted the problems courts have in enforcing social media restrictions on jurors.

Gable Tostee, 30, was found not guilty of the murder or manslaughter of Warriena Wright, a woman he met using the dating app Tinder.

After four days of deliberation at Queensland’s supreme court in Brisbane, jurors reached a verdict on Thursday afternoon – but their decision was called into question when one was found to have been posting about the trial to Instagram.

The Queensland woman shared at least four photos of takeaway coffees with her 2,500-plus followers, tagged at the supreme court, as well as some of her thoughts about the case.

“I snagged a bad one lovelies,” she wrote last week, beneath an image of a skim-milk flat white. “But I’m sure that I’m never thrown anything that I can’t handle, so although it will be a tough trial, I will learn and grow from it.”

On a later post, also of a coffee cup, she commented that the trial was “draining”. “It’s a high profile case ... Interesting to see the process though,” she wrote.

In a post on Wednesday she wished her followers good morning before a screed of hashtags: “Happy hump day people! Another day of jury duty, another stroll across the Goodwill Bridge, another delicious coffee in a gorgeous cup.”

She was asked by one Instagram user if she was on the Tostee case and replied in the affirmative. She told another: “I’m so glad I’m finding these pretty cups every day … because the trial has certainly been less than pretty.”

The woman posted a picture of yet another cup on Thursday morning, hours before the jury delivered its verdict.

“Right now I am feeling highly caffeinated after drinking this huge coffee from #cafeonthegoodwillbridge and ready to face yet another day of deliberations … I think.”

She did not discuss evidence or the jury’s deliberations but, as her account was public, all three images of the images she posted this week appeared on the court’s Instagram page .

The near-miss has highlighted the difficulties of keeping jurors off social media, lest their posting about trials – or reading others’ commentary – affects their outcome .

The problem has only increased as social media has become more ubiquitous. Prof Anne Wallace, a Perth-based law academic who has done extensive work on the impact of social media on the work of courts, said it reflected the blurring of lines between private and public across the board.

“It’s a serious business, you’re there doing a civic duty – [posting about] coffee is not really appropriate when you’re deciding about someone’s liberty, and someone else’s death ...

“The comments you might have made to your partner at the end of the day in private, we now have made ‘in private’ to your Instagram followers.”

Discussion of the woman’s posts delayed the delivery of the verdict on Thursday afternoon, with Tostee’s barrister arguing for a mistrial on the basis that they equated to a discussion of the case with outsiders.

But Justice John Byrne rejected the application, saying that the juror’s posts, though “unfortunate”, were not prejudicial.

“This is a particularly disappointing feature of the events of the day but only one is responsible for it,” he said.

“That juror will discover when she accesses her Instagram account that many members of the public have commented on her decision to communicate with others during the course of the trial.”

A court spokesperson on Friday said that although jurors are told repeatedly not to use social media during trials, no further action was planned against the woman.

The state’s Jury Act sets out a maximum penalty of two years’ imprisonment for information about a jury’s deliberations or “identifying or likely to identify a person as a juror in a particular proceeding”.

Similar restrictions apply in the rest of Australia, as well as in the UK, Canada and New Zealand.

Marilyn Bromberg, a senior lecturer at the University of Notre Dame’s law campus in Fremantle, Western Australia, said social media activity had caused jurors in Australia – and, in some cases, entire juries – to be dismissed, but no charges had been laid.

In the UK, however, there had been two cases of jurors being imprisoned for contempt of court: one in 2011, and one in 2013.

The US allows jurors to identify themselves. But social media activity had compromised proceedings in at least 20 US trials, Bromberg said.

She said of the problem: “We don’t even know how widespread it is because it could be happening and we don’t know about it.”

Jurors are also forbidden from reading information about the trial other than the evidence presented in court. Such information, Bromberg said, was “very hard to avoid” on social media.

Introducing blanket bans for the duration of court proceedings and legislating stricter penalties have been put forward as possible solutions. A Queensland criminal barrister commenting on the Tostee case proposed “quarantining … jury members from phones and outside communications until they reach a verdict”.

But enforcing that would present a new range of problems. “The general idea is you shouldn’t be punishing juries because they’re doing their civic duty, even if they do use social media,” Bromberg said.

“A lot of jurors who do comment about a case, they’re not malicious – they just either don’t realise that it was wrong to do, or they’re addicted. They post everything in their lives – it would seem incomprehensible that there’s something they can’t post about.”

She and Wallace are in favour of more detailed and consistent warnings about the potential consequences of posts to social media – not just to the trial, but to jurors personally.

“There’s why we preserve the anonymity of our jurors, in part – to protect them, as well as to guard against people putting pressure on them in relation to the verdict,” Wallace said.

Asking jurors to supply details of their social media presences – as is common practice in the US – would remind them to be prudent, as well as allow the court to monitor their activity.

But the risk of a juror either posting or reading potentially prejudicial commentary is heightened in trials in which there is as intense interest, as was the case for Tostee’s.

A closed Facebook group for “discussion” of the case has drawn close to 3,200 members in the 10 days since it was founded on 11 October; more than 600 joined after he was declared not guilty and that number is climbing.

After the verdict, discussion of his innocence is ongoing in the group, as are reactions from members as far away from the Gold Coast as Germany and the US. Links purporting to lead to the full 199-minute audio recording that he made of the fatal night have been shared there at multiple users’ requests.

One of the group’s two administrators – who have no known connection to the case – tried to enforce some parameters for the discussion in a pinned post about “a bit of housekeeping” on Thursday afternoon.



“We will not be approving one-line posts like ‘yeah baby, he’s free, i love you gable’ etc. These take up space and add nothing to the group.”

The admin also warned members to “post about the Instagram juror at your own risk”, as she would “take NO responsibility for any legal issue” that were to arise.



Screenshots of the woman’s posts – many scathing at her thoughtlessness – had already been widely shared on social media before she made her account private within an hour of the jury being dismissed on Thursday.

A brutal attack by police on garment workers protesting in Phnom Penh in January 2014 – in which four people were killed and 20 detained – prompted global brands including Puma, Gap and H&M to write to Cambodia’s government condemning the violence.

The incident is one of four case studies presented in a controversial new report published by the UK-based Charities Aid Foundation (CAF) which seeks to make the case for companies as a “force for good” in defending human rights and has angered human rights organisations.

Thulsi Narayanasamy from campaign group War on Want said the report was a “tool to whitewash the exploitative nature of many private sector industries, from the extractive companies through to fashion and electronics brands”.

Liam Barrington-Bush from the London Mining Network, a coalition of anti-mining campaign groups, was equally outraged. “It is often companies themselves that are the cause of the problems civil society seeks to address, bullying governments into avoiding regulatory responsibilities and lobbying for ever-more pro-business legislation,” he said.

While CAF accepts that not all corporations are saints, it maintains that responsible companies can and do make meaningful contributions to the promotion of human rights and the defence of civil society organisations being oppressed by states.

Among the other case studies cited in the report is that of Rafael Marques de Morais, an Angolan journalist charged with libel and defamation after publishing a book about human rights abuses in Angola’s lucrative diamond industry. Diamond retailers Tiffany & Co and Leber Jeweler issued a public statement condemning the trial, which was held behind closed doors.

Determining the precise influence of such interventions is never clear as oppressive governments rarely wish to be seen to bow to external pressure. Similarly, private companies typically try to stay quiet about their political interactions with oppressive regimes. In Marques’ case, he was eventually given a six-month suspended sentence. Cambodia’s garment workers would gain a “disappointingly low” $12 (£9.70) rise in the monthly minimum wage over a year after the police brutality.

“We have a responsibility to promote these good examples because that hopefully will become a self-fulfilling prophecy and … will encourage more companies to engage in defending civil society activists,” says Adam Pickering, international policy manager at CAF.

The report, which was written with research input from the London School of Economics, contains a list of proactive steps that companies should take. The recommendations include: putting direct pressure on governments to desist from abuses; participating in formal and informal networks that promote collective action; and using “organisational arrangements” such as structured partnerships with charities to ensure support over the long-term.

It is imperative that corporations are involved in a “long-running conversation” with civil society organisations about human rights, Pickering emphasises. “If there’s only a relationship when an issue flares up, then it’s difficult for companies to engage,” he says, adding that a better solution would see companies regularly meeting with NGOs and familiarising themselves with issues.

CAF isn’t dewy-eyed; the motivation for business to get involved is far from being purely altruistic. A robust, well-protected civil society is essential to guaranteeing the kind of high political and economic governance standards that businesses need for long-term investment, its report maintains.

This “business case” argument is echoed elsewhere. A recent report [pdf] by the London-based Institute for Human Rights and Business (IHRB), for instance, notes that the short-term advantages of corporate collusion with abusive regimes invariably backfire and end up harming companies’ longer-term interests.

The classic case study is Shell in Nigeria. The Anglo-Dutch company was alleged to have cosied up to the country’s military dictatorship for years to suppress resistance to its activities in Ogoniland. When the Nigerian junta executed Ogoni leader Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight others in 1995, the oil major suffered catastrophic reputational damage that remains a stain on its brand to this day.

Salil Tripathi, director of policy at IHRB, says civil society organisations are “missing a trick” by not recognising the common ground they have with companies regarding human rights. “Both want the rule of law, both want transparency, both want due process, both don’t want violence and both want a confrontation-free operational timeline,” he states.

This harmonious picture of shared interests isn’t always obvious in the rough and tumble of real life, he’s ready to concede – especially in countries where human rights defenders are threatened, imprisoned and worse.

“A lot of people in the civil society space see themselves as confronting the establishment, which has the capacity to improve lives of people and yet it gets it wrong,” says Tripathi.

That’s certainly the mindset at the London Mining Network. It believes asking companies to take a more proactive stand in defending human rights merely reinforces corporations’ growing dominance, says Barrington-Bush.

“By expecting companies to leverage their power against elected governments, CAF is setting the stage for the continued decline of our already-frail democracy, rather than actively working to protect it,” he adds.

The first UK-based opposite-sex couple to enter into a civil partnership in the British Isles have called on the government to make the process available to all couples, regardless of sexuality.

Claire Beale and Martin Loat travelled from their home in Ealing, west London, to the Isle of Man – the only place in the British Isles where heterosexual couples can have a civil partnership – where they will have the ceremony on Friday. The couple, who have two children and have lived together since 1992, said they wanted a formal recognition of their relationship but did not want to get married.

Civil partnerships, which were introduced in 2004 for same-sex couples, are not available to heterosexual couples in the UK. But the Isle of Man, which is a crown dependency but not part of the UK, made civil partnerships available to everybody this summer.

Beale and Loat hope the UK government will come to allow heterosexual couples to enter into civil partnerships, or that public pressure will lead to a civil partnership formed in the Isle of Man to become recognised in the UK.

The couple said in a statement: “We respect that other people in committed, lasting relationships might want to opt for marriage. We regard ourselves as one of the millions of ‘happily unmarried’ couples in the UK.

“We want a less encumbered, light-touch civil union that recognises our relationship on our terms, free from the trappings and social pre-conditions of marriage.”

Last week, Adeline Cosson and Kieran Hodgson became the first ever opposite-sex couple in the British Isles to get a civil partnership. As residents of the Isle of the Man, their union will be recognised by their home government, unlike Beale and Loat’s. “The main thing was that we wanted to keep it simple,” Cosson told the Guardian after the ceremony. “We are a young couple. We do want to get married one day, but not now. This gives us rights under the law.”

The Isle of Man ceremonies come less than two weeks before the appeal court in London is due to hear the case of another couple, Rebecca Steinfeld and Charles Keidan, who argue that the ban on opposite-sex civil partnerships breaches the Human Rights Act.

The couple lost the first ruling on their case in January, but decided to appeal following a wave of public support, in which 70,000 people signed an online petition asking UK civil partnerships to be open to all.

Both London couples are part of the Equal Civil Partnerships campaign. “We now have 0.1% of British Isles sewn up, only another 99.9% to go!” Loat said.

Self-employment status – who's next under the HMRC spotlight
###########################################################
The decision by HM Revenue and Customs to further investigate Hermes couriers’ complaints about their employment status coincides with clear signals that Theresa May’s government would like to be seen as being on the side of Britain’s fast-growing, precariously employed workforce.



The tax authority has passed complaints and allegations to its compliance teams from 98 couriers working for Hermes, which delivers parcels for John Lewis and Next, following the Guardian’s investigation in July that found several were earning below the minimum wage and felt they were effectively employees.

Frank Field MP took up the cause and demanded action from Theresa May in her first weeks as prime minister. She in turn passed a dossier on Hermes couriers to her business minister, Margot James, who asked the HMRC to investigate.

Letters to Field released on Thursday from Edward Troup, the executive chairman of HMRC, and Jane Ellison, financial secretary to the Treasury, indicate a concerted effort – emanating from Downing Street – to deal with any companies found to be abusing the concept of self-employment.

Troup warned: “If we find that companies have misclassified individuals as self-employed, we will take all necessary steps to make sure they pay the appropriate tax, national insurance contributions, interest and penalties.”

Ellison threatened “strong action” when companies “force staff down routes [that] deny them the employment rights and benefits they are entitled to” in order to reduce costs.

If workers are self-employed then companies don’t have to pay employer national insurance contributions, which saves 13% on the payroll bill at a stroke. Neither are they obliged to offer any sick pay, paid holiday or pensions.

May has also appointed a former adviser to Tony Blair, Matthew Taylor, to “consider how employment practices need to change in order to keep pace with modern business models” indicating that regulatory change to how self-employment is defined may be coming.

Hermes, for its part, insists it has done nothing wrong. It says that it pays its couriers above the national living wage and that the HMRC examined its use of self-employed contractors in 2011 and found there to be no problem. It has said it will cooperate with any HMRC investigation.

Ministers are speaking in chorus about their desire to help the low-paid at the moment. In a speech on Tuesday, James said that workers who are not being paid the minimum wage “need to feel they can speak up – I want them to speak up … The person who may not be able to make ends meet already, who struggles to feed their family and heat their home, should not be ripped off by their boss.”

That echoed May’s first speech in Downing Street in which she said she would be guided by the interests of people who “have a job but you don’t always have job security”.

But Labour is sceptical. Clive Lewis, the shadow business secretary, said: “Theresa May and the government have made statements about wanting to be the party of the worker. If they are now not just using the same language as us but putting their words into practice we will applaud them all the way. But so far there has been little to see and it is rhetoric at the moment.”

Torsten Bell, director of Resolution, a thinktank specialising in employment issues, said there had been “a marked and welcome shift in government thinking in recognising that tackling precarious employment is a key living standards issue.

“Supporting those workers who are just managing has risen up the political agenda, underpinning a wish to both update the law to keep up with our changing workforce and crucially to enforce it with a harder line on prosecutions,” he said. “Whatever the result of the specific HMRC investigation into Hermes, the fact that a national debate is under way on the changing world of work can only be a good thing.”

Other companies in the gig economy will be watching what happens closely not just in the Hermes case but also in the employment tribunal case brought by Uber drivers who want to be classed as workers rather than self-employed.

“Organisations of all sizes can expect to have their employment practices scrutinised if they appear, even inadvertently, to be unfairly passing business costs and risk on to their staff,” said Paul McFarlane, employment law partner at Weightmans, a company of solicitors.

“If an organisation miscategorises someone as self-employed, when in reality they are a worker or employee, it could face significant tax liabilities, penalties – including possible criminal sanctions – for failing to comply with auto-enrolment obligations and a wide range of employment tribunal claims including claims for unpaid holiday pay and minimum wage.”

UK immigration laws permitting refugees to be deported if they exhibit “extremist behaviour” may breach a United Nations convention, the organisation’s general assembly is to be told.

In a speech condemning states for exploiting security fears to frustrate their international legal obligation to provide safe havens, the UN official responsible for reporting on counter-terrorism, Ben Emmerson QC, will criticise the UK’s record.

Emmerson, who recently left his post as counsel to the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse, has been the UN’s special rapporteur on “protecting human rights while countering terrorism” since 2011.

“The link between displacement of people from their homes and risks to national security in the countries in which they seek refuge has been irresponsibly and misleadingly overblown in many states, with the refugee crisis being used to stoke public fears of terrorism,” he is due to tell the UN session on Friday.

“There is almost no evidence that terrorist groups take advantage of refugee flows to carry out acts of terrorism, or that refugees are somehow more prone to radicalisation than others. These claims are analytically and statistically unfounded.”

Following the Islamic State-inspired attacks on Paris last autumn there were widespread reports that some of the gunmen had infiltrated refugee groups travelling through Greek islands. Those reports have since been thrown into doubt amid uncertainty over the black market trade in fake passports.

Referring to legislative measures designed to single out suspected radicals from the refugee population, Emmerson says: “The United Kingdom, as just one example here, has enacted legislation allowing for the review and revocation of refugee status if a person is thought to have exhibited extremist behaviour, or if their dependents have acted in a manner inconsistent with British values.

“Legislation of this kind, with the vagaries that are necessarily entailed in such generalised definitions, runs a risk of falling short of the requirements of the 1951 refugee convention.”

His reference is to a Home Office report, Asylum Policy Instruction: Revocation of Refugee Status, published earlier this year. It states: “Extremist behaviour: where there is any evidence that a refugee or their dependents have engaged in unacceptable behaviours (whether in the UK or abroad) considered not conducive to the public good or has acted in a way which undermines British values, their status must be reviewed [and referred to the special cases unit ].”

It also notes that: “Although there is no requirement to formally respond to representations from [the UN high commissioner for refugees] caseworkers must take their comments into account as part of the decision on whether to proceed with revocation and provide UNHCR with a copy of the final decision.”

Elsewhere in his speech, Emmerson says: “Almost without exception, refugees and migrants do not pose a risk – they are in fact at risk, fleeing regions where terrorist groups are most active. It is beyond question that terrorist activity, in the form of asymmetrical armed conflict, is a significant driver for internal displacement and the flight of refugees.

“Many states have introduced stricter border controls, built fences and walls to keep migrants and refugees out, engaged in push-back operations, criminalised irregular migration and abandoned pledges to accept refugees.

“Among the measures that pose serious human rights concerns are ethnic or religious profiling, the disproportionate collection of often inaccurate biometric and other data, forced fingerprinting and, perhaps most seriously, the criminalisation of irregular migration.”

Emmerson also raises concerns about the EU/Turkey agreement, which “provides for the blanket return of all migrants crossing from Turkey into Greece”. He said he was concerned about the “absence of individualised consideration and the risk of detention or ill treatment in Turkey”. 



Emmerson’s report on the impact of counter-terrorism measures on the human rights of migrants and refugees, which details his criticisms, is on the UN’s website.

HMRC’s focus on workers’ employment status could shift the spotlight on to other firms with large self-employed workforces. Several firms are already facing action from workers taking their cases to employment tribunals.

According to one employment expert, the timing of the HMRC intervention against Hermes is important because it follows the government announcement this month of a review of workers’ rights and practices by Matthew Taylor, a former adviser to Tony Blair. An employment tribunal is also considering whether drivers for taxi-hailing tech firm Uber should be recognised as company staff.

Matt Gingell, an employment specialist at the Gannons, said: “This comes at a time when the government has asked Matthew Taylor to do a review of the law and we are waiting for the Uber judgment, so companies must be a bit concerned about the grey area of status, and whether people they say are self-employed really are.”

The firm uses about 30,000 drivers in London, all of whom are designated as self-employed. In July, two drivers took a case to an employment tribunal arguing that they should be classed as workers, meaning they were entitled to holiday pay and the national living wage. They said that their work was controlled by the firm as they are only told the destination of a job when they pick someone up, and they were not allowed to send another driver in their place – two features of employment. If the ruling goes in their favour, 17 other drivers will also be deemed to be workers and entitled to compensation, and HMRC may decide to take a closer look at the firm. The tribunal’s ruling is due imminently.



Uber said the case only involves a very small number of its 30,000 drivers and that it is a technology company rather than a transport provider, working with “driver partners” and offering them flexibility to control how much and often they work.

The four firms are facing tribunal cases brought by cycle couriers working in London who argue they are not really self-employed. Currently, they are classed as “independent contractors”, but say they should be recognised as workers because: they tend to work for one company at a time only; are subject to the control of their managers; and have no say over their rates of pay. One courier, Andrew Boxer, said that he carried a company ID for Excel at all times. “I don’t have any independence as such,” he said. The first case, against City Sprint, will start on 22 November and the other three will follow in the new year.

The courier companies say the tribunal claims are unfounded. Excel has previously said its London couriers “operate as independent subcontractors”.

The takeaway food delivery service has more than 3,000 riders around the UK on contracts that say they are self-employed and cannot contest their status. Employment lawyers have dismissed this clause as unenforceable. A strike in the summer over changes to the way riders were paid to deliver food prompted the government to state that workers’ status was determined “by the reality of the working relationship and not the type of contract they have signed”. It also led drivers to join forces to call for better rights. Next week, the Independent Workers of Great Britain union is holding a meeting for Deliveroo riders to discuss how to win better rights and be paid the London living wage of £9.40 per hour if they are based in the capital.

Deliveroo has defended its employment terms, saying: “We provide a platform for people to work with us on a freelance basis. This allows riders to work flexibly around another commitment, like studying or other work. We’ve worked with legal experts to design our contracts to reflect that.”

Michael Newman, an employment lawyer at Leigh Day, said there were other “gig economy” businesses that depend heavily on self-employed workers. “There are other smaller businesses in different sectors, such as cleaning, that tend to go under the radar,” he said. “People who are working for these are likely to face the same issues of no holiday or sick pay, or not earning the living wage.”

Newman said that these companies were unlikely to be too concerned about the latest development at HMRC. “Until they see some kind of enforcement in place it will be business as usual,” he said.

Violence inside prisons in England and Wales is at its most serious level ever and is getting worse, the new chair of the parole board has warned.

Prof Nick Hardwick said that the stabbing inside Pentonville prison on Monday was “the most extreme example of the decline in safety” that he and others have warned about for years.

In his Howard League Parmoor lecture, he says that without “a very substantial increase in staffing levels” ambitious government plans to improve rehabilitation and education or tackle extremism “are simply not achievable”.

He welcomed a £14m scheme to recruit 400 extra staff at the 10 worst prisons, which was announced two weeks ago by the justice secretary Liz Truss. But he added: “It does not compensate for the thousands of extra staff who have been taken out of prisons over the last few years and I am afraid a lot more than 10 prisons are in trouble.

“The meaning of the increase in suicides, assaults and murders we are seeing now is not just the awful consequences for the prisoners, staff and families involved but the evidence they provide of a loss of control of our prisons.”

Hardwick, who is the former chief inspector of prisons, said Truss and her justice ministers fully understand the gravity of the situation and the need for a very substantial increase in staffing.

“The 400 extra staff must be just the first immediate step,” he said. “The problem is now of such a scale, and the resources required to address it so significant, that it will take a government-wide commitment to address it in the next spending round. And whether government as a whole understands the problem I don’t know.”

He rejected the prison governors’ association call for a public inquiry, describing it as a “cry of anguish”, but said the last thing that was needed now was to wait for an inquiry report before action was taken.

Hardwick said that if staffing numbers cannot be increased quickly then the record 85,000 prison population needs to be reduced. As the new chair of the parole board, he says it is not for him to advocate radical sentencing or population management changes but ministers do need to be looking at all options.

Instead he set out a plan to cut prison numbers in one area he is responsible for – the release of 3,263 prisoners serving imprisonment for public protection (IPP) sentences who have past their initial “tariff” period but have no set release date.

He said the parole board could resolve some of the problems surrounding one group of IPP prisoners who have mental health problems or have chaotic lifestyles but do not pose a risk of serious further offending and could be managed in the community. He gave the example of an elderly and frail sex offender at one recent parole hearing who could be released to a care home provided he had no contact with children but the difficulty lay in finding a care home prepared to take him.

“If the parole board can resolve some of these issues and continue to make the progress it has been making, and if nothing else changes, we estimate we can get the number of IPP prisoners down to about 2,000 by 2020.”

Ministers could go further, and more quickly, by considering the options of compassionate release for a small number of IPP prisoners by making it easier to release short-term IPPs with tariffs of less than two years and reduce recalls after their release by limiting licence periods.

Justice ministers confirmed in the House of Lords on Thursday that a prison safety and reform white paper will be published shortly to be followed by legislation in the new year. Richard Keen, for the government, said safe and secure prisons were a fundamental part of ministers’ reform ambitions.

Alistair Carmichael (Letters, 19 October) claims the Liberal Democrats are the only party standing up for civil liberties, but he knows that isn’t true. In both the House of Commons and the House of Lords we Greens have been fighting the government as it tries to push through its privacy-invading investigatory powers bill.

Has he forgotten that we worked with the Lib Dems in the Lords to fight for strong safeguards in the bill? Or that we voted against the bill in parliament?

The Green party has worked with the Lib Dems to try to defeat the Conservatives. The unfair electoral system and absurdity of the House of Lords might mean we only have one representative in each, but we’re using our position to make a real stand on civil liberties. Where there is obvious common ground it must be celebrated and used to our advantage – not ignored for the sake of political point-scoring.

While the Labour safeguards to the bill are welcome improvements, they ignore the hard lessons from the scandals of recent years, such as blacklisting, the use of undercover officers and the domestic extremism database. All of these have shown the police systematically evading the rules.

It is essential the bill has the proper safeguards that we’ve argued for in the Lords. Without significant changes, the bill remains a draconian piece of legislation from a government that has given us the Orwellian Prevent strategy, refugee snatch squads and a declared intention of leaving the European convention on human rights. It’s not every day that a country hands huge powers to the state and effectively ends privacy. We need real opposition, if liberty and democracy are going to thrive.

A retired academic raided by armed police after Interpol tipped them off that she had illegally imported a “euthanasia kit” took her own life a few days later, an inquest has ruled.

The coroner said that Prof Avril Henry, 81, a member of the pro-euthanasia group Exit International, died at a “time and place she decided herself”.

Coroner John Tomalin said Henry was a “lady who knew her own mind, a bright, intelligent retired professor”. He added: “She suffered a number of painful and debilitating conditions which there were no cure for.”

The full details of the police raid were not given in court but it is understood that she surrendered some of the drugs in her kit after officers forced their way into her home – but kept half without officers realising.

Police were called back to her cottage in the village of Brampford Speke in Devon a few days later and Henry, who was a professor of English medieval culture at the University of Exeter until 2000, was discovered dead in her bath.

At the time of her death in April, the Australian euthanasia campaigner Prof Philip Nitschke, who founded Exit International, said Henry was furious at the intervention by Devon and Cornwall police, accused the force of being heavy-handed and said Exit International was warning other members of what had happened.

The inquest in Exeter was told that Henry had “a number of painful and debilitating conditions” including arthritis, spinal pain, incontinence, cardiac failure, chronic deafness, sleep problems, asthma and swollen feet.

Her GP, Dr Stephen Vercoe, said she first mentioned euthanasia in November 2013 when she told him: “Life is not really worth living any more.”

She told other health workers that she wanted to go to Dignitas in Switzerland to end her life but they told her it was illegal for them to help her – which she accepted.

Vercoe said: “Myself and several other medical professionals were well aware of Prof Henry’s intention but we all felt she had mental capacity, was not sectionable and there was no further action we could take.”

She ordered drugs from Mexico on the internet but police were tipped off and raided her home. However, this did not stop her taking her life a few days later. In a note she said her death had been “laboriously planned” and described the law that prevents people being helped to take their own lives as “illogical” and “cruel”.

Henry said she did not believe there needed to be a postmortem examination and asked that her body be buried in her orchard. A postmortem examination found Henry’s death was caused by the drugs she had taken.

Of the raid, William Michelmore, her solicitor, told the inquest: “Two armed police officers smashed a glass panel in Avril’s door and came into her house. She was very upset by the infringement on her personal space by the police forcing their way in.”

She instructed Michelmore to lodge a complaint with Devon and Cornwall police. The coroner said: “Dr Henry appeared to start considering ending her life before she became too unwell. This goes back to November 2013, when she first spoke to her GP about this.

“In fact, she made no secret of her intentions and was assessed by her GP and psychiatrist on more than one occasion. The medical profession all concluded that she wasn’t depressed, she had full mental capacity to make decisions about when and how she would end her life.

“The evidence to me is quite clear. Dr Henry set about a course of action that was intended to end her life at a method, a time and place that she decided herself.”

In April when Henry died, Nitschke said: “Police need to realise that in the UK suicide is not a crime, and mental health authorities need to recognise that not everyone who seeks to end their life is in need of psychiatric intervention.

“Her death was a clear case of ‘rational suicide’ and her decision to die at her own time and in her own place should have been respected. As it is the authorities did everything they could to make her last days on this earth a misery.”

After the inquest Nitschke told the Guardian there were about five more police raids around the UK following that on Henry’s house.

He said: “The pattern was always the same – local police visiting at night asking to come in for a talk as they ‘were concerned about the person’s wellbeing’. Generally they were let in, at which point they said they had information ‘from Interpol’ that they had imported the euthanasia drug and that they should hand it over.

“The information was always correct. Generally the drugs were handed over and they were asked about their involvement with Exit.”

He added: “The effect on our membership was dramatic. Lots of anxious people wondering where the breach in security had come from. In retrospect it looks as though it was the email communication with a particular Mexican supplier. This supplier now uses email encryption.

“My best guess is that these bouts of enthusiastic activity are designed to ‘send a message’ to Exit’s elderly membership to stop seeking internet euthanasia drugs. If this is the case it’s been remarkably successful.”



Exit International is a not-for-profit Australian company that says it has an online membership of 18,000 supporters around the world.

It says the average age of Exit members is 75 years. A significant minority, it adds, are seriously ill.

Nitschke burned his medical practising certificate last November after a long-running fight with the Medical Board of Australia but said he would continue to advise terminally ill patients about how to take their lives.

In the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123.

In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Hotline is 1-800-273-8255. 

In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is on 13 11 14.

A 21-year-old Pentonville inmate who was stabbed to death on Tuesday had just sent his fiancee a heartfelt card telling her he wanted to become “a better man and father”.

Jamal Mahmoud, who had a 10-month-old son with his fiancee, died after being stabbed in an attack on Tuesday while two other inmates, aged 21 and 30, were taken to a hospital in east London, where they remain in a critical condition. Two prisoners, aged 34 and 26, have been arrested on suspicion of murder.

It was reported on Thursday that Mahmoud was stabbed with a “hunting style” knife, before being thrown off a nine-metre-high (30ft) landing.

His fiancee, Melissa Modeste, posted pictures of a card on Facebook which said “Missing You” on the front. She said the card had arrived on Thursday, two days after her partner was killed. 



“I have just received the most heart breaking card from my lovely Jamal this morning. Words will never describe how myself and his family is feeling. Forever loved, forever in our hearts,” she wrote.

Inside the card Mahmoud had written that he had “unconditional love” for her and their son, adding “without you I don’t think I couldn’t have come this far. You make everything easy for me every single day.”

He wrote: “You are a strong minded individual person and I’m proud to say that my son has the best mother in the world. You have grown to become a mature woman and I hope I can make you proud by becoming a better man and father to both of you. Love you Baby.”

Opposite the message he had drawn a childlike picture of a detached house, with a smiling sun. In front were simple drawings of the three of them together.

In an emotional previous post Modeste wrote: “Sleep tight my darling Jamal. I miss you, I love you, forever and always.”

She added: “I miss the amazing head rubs, I miss giving you back rubs, I miss us always going Nandos, I miss sharing a bed with you, I miss waking up to you, I miss the morning kisses … I miss us talking about having another baby in the future, I miss us planning to get our marriage registered, I miss going for walks with you, I miss holding your hand. I miss you.”

The family of Mahmoud, who was of Somali descent, have called for Pentonville to be shut down. 



Aisha Salah, Mahmoud’s cousin, told the BBC: “I blame the prison. It’s very disturbing. I just hope that place gets shut down as soon as possible because it’s not safe.”

In the wake of the attack, about half of the 200 prison officers at the jail passed a vote of no confidence in its governor, Kevin Reilly.



The officers claim they are unable to prevent the influx of weapons and drugs being thrown over the prison walls while also monitoring prisoners, BBC London reported.

It is understood that they have insisted on talks with the deputy governor about reducing the number of inmates allowed in the yard at the same time and increasing the number of staff on prison landings.

John Attard, from the Prison Governors Association, said the death had come as “no massive surprise” and added that the PGA had called for a public inquiry a week earlier.

Speaking outside the prison gates following the attack, Attard said: “The reduction in staffing is a key factor, there’s no doubt about that, but synthetic drugs also had some part in that. What we would like to see is a regime that can be managed safely with the right number of staff.”

Mahmoud was jailed for six and a half years in July as one of two gang members sentenced after hiding a loaded Skorpion machine gun and ammunition in a garden in Enfield, north London, the previous July. He was already serving five and a half years in prison for a separate robbery.

Following his killing his sister, Souzan Mahmoud, said: “You think your brother is in safe hands, you know, and to hear that he had to die that way, alone, where we thought he would be safe, it really hurts us. Everyone is in pieces, as you can see.”



Speaking to ITV News, she said: “The case ended a long time ago. Why was he still there [at Pentonville]? He should have been shipped out a long time ago.

“We just thought the guards would be there … I blame the prison more than the actual person that’s done it. They owed him a duty of care and they just neglected him. [My mother]’s worried about my other brother, who is also in prison.”

Their mother, Hawa Mahmoud, added: “I miss him so much. I can’t ever forget, never ever, my son.”

Danny Rynne, a scaffolder from Enfield, described Mahmoud as “lovely” and “placid”.

He said: “It’s a shame what happened. I don’t know too much about what it’s about but it’s a shock to everyone. He’s a small fella and proper placid. He wouldn’t say boo to no one unless somebody started on him.”

HMP Pentonville is a category B Victorian prison that opened in 1842 and holds more than 1,200 men. An inspection report on the jail published last year revealed that “most prisoners felt unsafe”, while “levels of violence were much higher than in similar prisons and had almost doubled since the last inspection”.



Official figures show there were more than 20,000 assaults in prisons – 2,813 of them deemed “serious” – in the 12 months to December, a rise of 27% year on year, with nearly 5,000 attacks on staff – a jump of more than a third compared with 2014.

The data also showed there were six apparent killings in the year to March 2016, up from four in the same period in 2015 and the largest number for a year to March since current records started in 2000.

A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: “The secretary of state has been clear that safety in prisons is fundamental to the proper functioning of our justice system and a vital part of our reform plans.

“We are fully committed to addressing the significant increase in violence, self-harm and self-inflicted deaths in our prisons.”

The spokesperson added that £14m worth of investment had been announced for the UK’s 10 worst prisons, which would increase staffing levels by 400.

When Prentiss Mayo showed up to traffic court on 19 October 2015, he tried to explain that he was blind and that his impairment affected his case.

“I don’t believe any of it,” Culver said repeatedly in his Oakland, California, courtroom before he ordered Mayo to pay a $221 fine on fare evasion charges. The case was quickly closed, but the judge’s dismissive remarks about Mayo’s blindness didn’t stop.

Culver laughed. “Man, I like this. You really got style. It’s all lies. Sit over there on the right-hand side of the courtroom.”

Mayo, 34, was stunned to hear the mockery and asked again where he should go.

“I’ve never been so embarrassed in my whole life,” Mayo said in a recent interview, explaining that he lost his vision after a stabbing attack. “It just really felt like he denied my whole experience.”

This week, Culver, who some attorneys say is one of the cruelest traffic judges in the state, was accused of “willful misconduct” by the California commission on judicial performance. The case offers a rare window into the inner workings of the controversial traffic courts that have burdened low-income people with insurmountable debts for minor offenses.

The charges – which chronicle Culver’s “rude” and “harsh” treatment of defendants and “abuse of authority” – come at a time when advocates across the country have increasingly raised alarms about the way police agencies and courts try to collect revenue from marginalized communities through exorbitant fines and fees for low-level citations.

In Ferguson, Missouri, where reports on the mistreatment of black residents sparked national protests, municipal leaders have faced widespread criticism for issuing tens of thousands of warrants for minor offenses, trapping poor people in cycles of debt and poverty and disproportionately targeting minorities.

Civil rights lawyers say the problem is just as bad in liberal California and that the Culver charges illustrate how traffic judges have wide discretion to abuse vulnerable defendants and order fines that can destroy people’s lives.

“He’s the worst I’ve ever been in front of,” said Osha Neumann, supervising attorney with the East Bay Community Law Center who represented Mayo in his 2015 case. “People were generally treated with almost a sneering contempt. [Culver] seemed like a person who was angry with the world ... and took it out on the people who appeared before him.”

Culver is facing 10 counts in the misconduct case, including charges that he is “unfit to serve” and that he is “prejudicial to the administration of justice”.

In one case, Culver screamed “Keep your mouth shut!” at a female defendant, according to the complaint. He then allegedly threatened to “fight” her, saying: “I wish I didn’t have this robe on. We would straighten it out.”

In another case, a man pleaded for leniency for running a red light and driving without a license, saying that he has a “big family” and couldn’t pay the $1,043 fine. Culver mocked him in his response, saying: “We’re not gonna let you break the law, walk out ’cause you made a bunch of kids.”

Culver told one man accused of “reversing his vehicle in an unsafe manner” that he “better be quiet”, adding: “Don’t make me put you through door number two.” This apparent threat to jail him was an “abuse” of power, the charges alleged.

When one woman tried to present photo evidence, the judge responded: “Ma’am, now you gonna keep runnin’ your mouth, I’m gonna have to call somebody to have this dealt with.”

The complaint also revealed that Culver repeatedly implied that police are always right and defendants are generally lying, regardless of evidence. That’s a problem that critics say is pervasive in traffic courts where, unlike criminal court, defendants do not have a right to a public defender.

In one dispute over a charge of failing to come to a full stop, Culver told a defendant: “I’m interested in why a cop would put his career on the line to lie about you.”

Culver also scolded an Asian woman for saying “sorry” in English when she had an interpreter: “Why you talking about ‘sorry’? You got an interpreter. Cut it out. Use the interpreter like I told you.”

When fines are more than $1,000, Culver has consistently refused to let defendants do community service instead of paying, regardless of their income, the charges said. One day in court, prior to arraignments, he told a group of defendants: “Don’t waste any time talking about your drama ’cause nobody in here cares about it. There’s nobody special in here but me.”

The judge is also accused of making inappropriate sexual remarks, allegedly talking about “kissing” staff and joking about his “ability to sustain an erection”.

Culver did not respond to requests for comment. His lawyer, Arthur Harris, told the Guardian that the judge “disputes the charges”, adding: “He looks forward to a full, fair and impartial hearing to respond to those allegations.”

Although Culver’s language may be unique, advocates said his actions reflect unfair policies that are common throughout the system.

“Taylor Culver said out loud what many judges are unfortunately putting into practice, which is: ‘The court needs money and therefore we don’t care whether you can afford to pay this ticket,’” said Elisa Della-Piana, legal director of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights of the San Francisco Bay Area, who has appeared before the judge.

The charges against Culver come more than a year after a local paper, the East Bay Express, published an investigation on the judge. “There are many courtrooms across California where there is no one watching,” Della-Piana added.

While consequences for one judge can have an impact, activists said the system should be overhauled so that the courts can no longer require low-income people to pay steep fines.

Last year, one report found that more than 4 million California residents have lost their driver’s licenses because they can’t afford to pay traffic fines and fees. The suspensions make it harder for many to find and maintain employment and keep up with daily responsibilities.

“It puts you in a spiral,” said Brandon Greene, staff attorney with East Bay Community Law Center. “They don’t have enough money, and they can’t pay the debt.”

Another recent study also found that the license suspensions are much more common in black and Latino neighborhoods and areas with high poverty rates.

Culver’s courtroom was often 90-95% people of color, Neumann said. Without a lawyer, few have a chance of winning a case in front of Culver, he added. “There was never any sympathy ... and it has genuinely devastating consequences.”

A prisoner who battered his cellmate to death with a flat screen TV has been sentenced to 14 years in jail for the “particularly brutal” attack.

Jordan Palmer, was under the influence of the synthetic cannabis drug Spice when he attacked Terrence Ojuederie, who had the bottom bunk in their cell at HMP Peterborough.

A jury at Peterborough crown court accepted that this was involuntary intoxication and that he had not intended to take the drug.

Palmer, 26, was cleared of murder but found guilty of manslaughter by diminished responsibility following a two-and-a-half week trial.

Judge David Farrell QC, sentencing Palmer, said: “The killing was particularly brutal. You subjected Mr Ojuederie to a totally unprovoked and ferocious attack, punching him, kicking him, stamping on him and using a television set as a weapon to inflict serious and fatal injuries to his head and face.

“The cause of death, as the jury heard, was blunt force injuries to the chest and face.”

The attack happened on 9 December last year after Palmer complained of feeling unwell to prison officers.

Ojuederie, 42, was “undeniably smoking Spice” during the course of the night and shortly before the attack, the court heard.

Spice was classified as a legal high at the time of the attack but has since been outlawed, Judge Farrell said.

The defence argued that Palmer became intoxicated either by inhaling smoke in the cell or by accidentally picking up and smoking a roll-up cigarette which contained Spice instead of tobacco.

“While you were under the influence of drugs, that influence does not totally explain why you did what you did,” said Judge Farrell.

He added Palmer had not completely lost the ability to control his actions, noting he washed his hands after the killing.

Palmer and Ojuederie had shared a cell for around three months and other prisoners and officers thought they “got on well”.

“But in the days before you were clearly upset by the break up with your girlfriend and you were annoyed with him smoking Spice in the cell, keeping you up at night and banging around,” said Judge Farrell.

Palmer had been serving a six-year prison sentence for grievous bodily harm, and Judge Farrell said he took this into account when imposing the sentence, which will run concurrently.

Judge Farrell said the family of Ojuederie had shown dignity throughout the course of the trial.

The government’s refusal to release secret advice about the legality of British drone strikes in Syria is to be challenged by a human rights group.

Rights Watch UK is appealing against a decision by the information commissioner that the Cabinet Office and the attorney general’s office should not be obliged to publish the document.

Without publication of the legal justification, it is argued, public debate over the policy of carrying out lethal attacks on UK nationals anywhere in the world will remain uninformed.

The dispute follows a series of drone attacks in Syria. Two Britons, Reyaad Khan and Ruhul Amin, were killed in targeted strikes near the Syrian city of Raqqa on 21 August 2015.

David Cameron, then the prime minister, told the Commons shortly afterwards that the attack was carried out on the grounds of self defence because the men were planning attacks in the UK.

The death of Mohammed Emwazi, the British-born militant nicknamed Jihadi John who appeared in Isis beheading videos, last November was also attributed to a joint US/UK airstrike.

Earlier this week, parliament’s influential joint committee on human rights (JCHR) criticised the government for refusing to explain how targets are selected, whether there was an “impossibility of capture” test and whether the laws of war were being misapplied outside recognised armed conflicts.

The JCHR’s chair, Labour MP Harriet Harman, said: “The government has chosen not to answer the most important questions raised by our [committee] concerning its understanding of the legal framework which governs the use of lethal drone strikes outside armed conflict.

“It is simply not good enough for the government to refuse to answer this on the grounds that it is a hypothetical question, when in the course of our inquiry it stated that it would be prepared to resort to such use of lethal force for counter-terrorism purposes even outside of armed conflict.

“Parliament is entitled to expect an explanation of the government’s view of the legal justification for such a use of force before it happens, rather than wait until it does.”

Rights Watch UK submitted a freedom of information request in September last year seeking publication of the advice the attorney general, Jeremy Wright QC, gave on the legality of the Khan and Amin strikes.

Both the attorney general’s office and the Cabinet Office declined to release the information. The information commissioner upheld their decisions in August.

Rights Watch UK said there was a disparity between the two departments’ responses: the Cabinet Office said it should be entirely secret, the attorney general’s officials said that only part of it needs to be withheld.

Yasmine Ahmed, executive director of Rights Watch UK, said: “The government’s refusal to clarify its position on the use of lethal force outside armed conflict on the basis that this is ‘hypothetical’ is a disingenous attempt to evade the crucial question – one which has profound ramifications for international law and human lives.

“The question lingers as to whether the government is following in the failed footsteps of the United States, reserving the right to kill its citizens outside declared war zones. This would reflect a radical reinterpretation of their international legal obligations – chipping away at long established constraints on the use of lethal force and creating a dangerous global precedent.

“The public has a right to know what the government is doing in their name, particularly when it involves a significant departure in the use of lethal force that could have implications for the security of the United Kingdom if other countries adopt a similar position.”

Appearing before the justice select committee last autumn, Wright acknowledged it was important in such exceptional circumstances that MPs should know that legal advice had been given, but he insisted its precise content could not be revealed.

Asked why, Wright said: “In part, it’s an obligation to ensure that legal advice taken by the government is as full and frank as it can be … It’s also important to take collective responsibility under cabinet government.”

A spokesperson for the attorney general’s office said: “The ICO upheld our decision not to disclose the information to Rights Watch as it was related to, or received from, one of a number of bodies which deal with security matters. We are pleased the ICO upheld our decision.”

The decision by Britain’s top taxman to send his heavy mob in to investigate the courier company Hermes speaks volumes about working life in modern Britain.

Make no mistake, the probe by HMRC compliance officers into allegations that courier drivers are being wrongly classified as self-employed and paid less than the legally binding national minimum wage goes well beyond the business practices of a single company.

Indeed, the news that the Treasury is taking a look at how people are employed across the whole “gig economy” speaks volumes. This is about more than Hermes – it is about the way in which the UK economy has been transformed during the past four decades.

The Britain of the immediate postwar period differed from the Britain of 2016 in a number of ways. The manufacturing sector was bigger, employing more than 8 million people at the peak in in the mid 1960s. Successive waves of de-industrialisation – in the early 80s, 90s and 2000s – have hollowed out Britain’s manufacturing base, which now accounts for about 10% of national output, a smaller proportion than in other leading industrial countries.

The declining share of manufacturing has been accompanied by another trend: the decline in trade union membership, particularly in the private sector. Unions remain strong in those parts of manufacturing that have survived the regular downturns, at companies such as Rolls-Royce and BAe Systems for example, and in the public sector, but they have struggled to get a foothold in the new companies that have been created.

The tendency, therefore, has been for high-paid, unionised jobs to be replaced by insecure, poorly paid ones where employees live in permanent fear of having contracts terminated if they make a fuss. The classic example of the changing face of Britain is the Sports Direct HQ at Shirebrook: a giant warehouse built on the site of a former pit.

These trends have been accelerated by the financial crisis and deep recession of 2007-09, which brought to an end a long period of uninterrupted growth and falling unemployment. The most severe slump in Britain’s postwar history meant workers taking paycuts in order to keep their jobs. Austerity meant redundancy for unionised employees in the public sector.

Self-employment became far more common, but it was not exactly the sort of buccaneering, entrepreneurial self-employment lionised by Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s. Instead, many of those who were working for themselves did so reluctantly after losing full-time employment. As the Resolution Foundation reported earlier this week, the self-employed are earning less than they did 15 years ago once inflation is taken into account.

What’s more, the taxi drivers, motorcycle couriers and distribution centre workers employed in the gig economy have found that they have no entitlement to paid holidays or sick pay even when they are working full-time for a single employer. This arrangement has worked well for the companies because it means a lower pay bill and higher profits. It is not so good for the people described by Theresa May as just about managing.

The drawbacks of this model are now becoming glaringly apparent. With cheap, cowed labour readily available, there has been little incentive for companies to invest in new plant, new technology or training. They have relied on the sweatshop approach instead.

The steady decline of manufacturing has been accompanied by a worsening of Britain’s balance of payments, with the 6% deficit a record for peacetime.

For years, these problems have been bubbling away beneath the surface of the economy without any real attention being paid to them. There has been no wave of strikes in protest at conditions in call centres to mirror those in the coalfields or the car industry in the 1970s and early 1980s.

Instead the unhappiness at what amounts to old-fashioned exploitation has manifested itself in other ways, most obviously through the vote for Brexit on 23 June. This was the chance to protest at low pay and rotten employers and millions of people took that opportunity readily. 



So if you want to know why HMRC will be crawling all over Hermes, the reason’s simple: people are mightily unhappy and, somewhat belatedly, the government has got the message.

The Ministry of Justice plans to wipe the criminal records of gay and bisexual men convicted of sexual offences that are no longer illegal. And according to the gay rights organisation Stonewall this means poet and writer Oscar Wilde should be exonerated.

In a symbolic gesture, the MoJ said there would be no historical limit in relation to past offences. However, it declined to say whether Wilde would be among those deemed posthumously pardoned due to the complexity of assessing his case. If homosexual acts are no longer illegal, those convicted for consensual activity will be deemed to have received a posthumous pardon.

The Liberal Democrat peer Lord Sharkey, who has moved for those convicted under homophobic laws in the past to have their convictions disregarded, said: “This is a momentous day for thousands of families up and down the UK who have been campaigning on this issue for decades. I am very grateful for the government’s support and the support of many of my colleagues in parliament.”



But Paul Twocock, director of campaigns at Stonewall, was less enthusiastic. He said: “We welcome the government announcement to issue a posthumous pardon to all gay and bi men unjustly prosecuted for being who they are, but we don’t think it goes far enough. John Nicolson MP’s proposed bill closes a loophole that means some gay and bi men who are still alive and living with those convictions still can’t have them deleted, despite them being unjust and not illegal today. We urge the government to look at bringing this into their proposal.”



What do you think? Has this law affected you or members of your family? What does the ruling mean to you? Does it go far enough? Do you think those affected should also be entitled to compensation? Share your thoughts and views.

After yet another chapter in one of Britain’s most high-profile rape cases, Chesterfield football club’s chief executive gave his own verdict: “We can now all move forward and focus on football.”

This case has raised serious questions about the justice system in rape cases and shown that while those victimised by sexual violence might be encouraged to report it, their path to justice is not likely to be an easy one. The fact that the law is willing to give weight to a victim’s sexual history puts everyone who reports at risk of having their personal lives invaded in a search for “evidence” – with only a slim prospect of a conviction for their attacker.

Among the intense debate of the last week, some have asked whether we can learn anything from the approach of the Nordic countries – the “world leaders” on gender equality. In most of the Nordic countries, victims’ sexual histories are not considered relevant evidence in rape cases and generally victims have the right to have their own lawyer appointed. Importantly, in Finland, Sweden and Norway, rape complainants are also extended certain procedural rights which give them a much stronger legal position in relation to the criminal justice procedure. That allows them to partly participate in the criminal justice process, as opposed to only having the status of a witness.

However, even these countries have not cracked the code. Along with the UK they also suffer from low conviction rates and some of the same biases. Victims’ medical histories can be subject to legal scrutiny, and offenders in Sweden are more likely to be convicted if their victim belongs to a higher social class. In Denmark, the alleged perpetrator’s alcohol consumption is likely to work in his favour, but if the victim was under the influence it works against her.

In Iceland, charges are significantly less likely to be issued if the victim was intoxicated when the rape took place. And cases that are reported within 24 hours to the police are more likely to proceed, even though we know that it normally takes victims more time to come to terms with what actually happened.

Indeed, some Nordic countries are looking to the UK for better practices. Sweden is likely to become the first Nordic country to discard its current definition of sexual violence, which focuses on the use of force, and adopt a consent-based one. That focus is far from perfect and is not necessarily likely to increase conviction rates, given the high burden of proof in criminal cases.

However, the message is considered important, and some hope that when coupled with a gross negligence provision – modelled on Norwegian law – a new legal definition could lead to more convictions. That way the prosecutor would not need to prove intent but to establish that the accused acted in an extremely careless manner.

As for England and Wales, report after report (after report, after report, after report) has outlined how the justice system can be improved, and how better to address the context in which violence against women takes place. It is time for politicians to translate words into deeds.

Victim’s rights to specialist support services must be secured, irrespective of whether they report or not. Consideration should also be given to strengthening victims’ procedural rights – including the right to a victim lawyer – in an effort to ensure a genuinely fair trial. A victim lawyer could, for example, challenge sexual history evidence or aggressive cross-examination from defence lawyers. This is where the Nordic countries can offer a useful example.

But even while we work towards an improved criminal justice system, we should not confine ourselves to only measuring justice in terms of conviction rates. The criminal justice system provides little incentive for accused persons to take responsibility for their actions – something reflected, perhaps, in the number of perpetrators. It is a hard fact to face, but there are close to 100,000 rapes in England and Wales alone every year. That number of perpetrators, who are predominantly men, demonstrates a serious structural failure in preventing – and responding to – sexual violence.

We need to resolve the injustice of rape by tackling it from different angles. Let’s stop the harmful socialisation of our children on the basis of gender stereotypes, and halt the hypersexualisation of women in the media. Let’s give our young people access to adequate sex and relationships education rather than leaving them alone facing complex online and offline realities. And let’s make sure we are there for victims and survivors, not only when they tell us they were raped, but also when they tell us who raped them.

So let’s step up our game. The Women’s Equality party was founded to do exactly that: to help to bring an end to the gendered structural inequalities, which are both the cause and the consequence of rape and other forms of violence against women and girls.

Then, when we have made some real progress, we can all get back to the football.

Near a sacred volcanic lake for the Oromo people in the Ethiopian town of Bishoftu, a boisterous crowd seized an unusual opportunity to chant anti-government slogans during their annual Irreecha cultural celebration.

Disregarding the Oromo officials and traditional leaders at the 2 October ceremony, the youthful protesters crossed their arms in a symbol of defiance and edged forward towards police armed with batons. In a defining moment for the Oromo resistance, one man got on stage, grabbed the microphone and sent the thousands in the audience into fever pitch as he led a chant.

“Down, down, Woyane! Down, down, TPLF!” he yelled, referring to the Tigrayan People’s Liberation Front party, which opponents say has controlled the strategically vital Horn of Africa nation for 25 years.

Minutes later, as demonstrators threatened to take over the stage, Oromia police triggered a deadly stampede by firing tear gas. The crackle of gunfire followed from armed officers and an armoured vehicle sped into action, exacerbating the panic. People fell into a deep ditch and were crushed. Others drowned in the lake, contributing to an official death toll of 52, while rights groups estimate that more than 100 died.

Social media activists characterised the bungled dispersal as a “massacre”, falsely accusing soldiers of shooting people from a helicopter, and called for “five days of rage”. A week later, the government announced a state of emergency after protesters rampaged across Oromia, burning government buildings, and torching farms and factories.

The events may mark a turning point in the 11-month uprising by the Oromo, Ethiopia’s most populous ethnic group, who cite frustrations over political and economic marginalisation. The movement, along with a series of violent demonstrations occurring since late July in the historically powerful Amhara region, had already threatened the authority of the government, a favoured partner of the UK and other donors that provide close to $4bn (£3.2bn) in aid a year.

The state of emergency is likely to mean the increased use of federal security forces, including the military, to quell unrest at the expense of regional states’ autonomy, as well as occasional curfews and suspensions of due process. The US Department of State said the move could “further enshrine” the repression that has contributed to the crisis.



The government has killed about 500 Oromo demonstrators so far during the crisis, while detaining tens of thousands more in an effort to discourage civil resistance. The message from those efforts and the latest round of unrest, however, is that it will be hard to subdue protesters, who see the government as discredited and embattled. That means the possibility of escalating violence in Africa’s second-most populous nation.

“If the government persists with the current stand, Ethiopia may be in for long-term instability,” said Hassen Hussein, a US-based regional analyst who has written sympathetically about the Oromo struggle.

The Bishoftu violence was preceded by a two-month lull, as new Oromo ruling party leaders emerged and pledged reforms. Before that, on 6 August, activists called for a day of “grand Oromo protests”, which resulted in about 70 deaths and included a rare demonstration in Addis Ababa, the capital. Federal police dispersed that rally, scattering attendees with batons and boots.

Among those subsequently detained was an educated young man calling himself Gudina Jalata. He’d previously stayed away from protests out of fear, but felt compelled to participate by witnessing continuing injustice across the sprawling region that encircles the capital. “First you have to be respected for your dignity – that is why I got involved. There is a lot of discrimination against the Oromo,” he said.

Before the government came to power in 1991 by removing a socialist junta, Ethiopia was a unitary state. A 1995 federal constitution ensured self-rule for minorities and promoted local languages in schools and government. However, Oromo allege the state is controlled by Tigrayans, who comprise 6% of the country’s almost 100 million-strong population, and say farmers are being unfairly evicted by investors tied to ruling elites.

The divergent narratives feed a furious debate. Far from being oppressors, TPLF elites say their community made huge sacrifices during a 16-year struggle that liberated the Oromo and other groups from Amhara domination. They add that ethnic federalism now protects those hard-won rights, and power is shared equitably within government, while the statist development model pushed by Meles Zenawi, the former TPLF chairman and prime minister who died in 2012, helped Ethiopia advance.

For Gudina and the other detainees, such claims seem fanciful. After time in a cramped cell, his group was driven to a federal police facility in the Awash area; some were held for a week and then released, others were held for up to two weeks. There were no showers or toilets and they were given only small amounts of bread and water. The camp had three components: gruelling barefoot exercises on gravel under a scorching sun, political lessons and bouts of investigation.

The workouts included being forced to hop forwards with hands behind their head. Even the injured had to participate; if there was any slacking off, they were beaten. “It was really inhuman,” Gudina said.

Tigrayan officers, the interviewed detainees claimed, gave lessons on federalism and ruling coalition doctrines. While they felt contempt for their instructors, the prisoners were compliant, although one bucked the trend and was severely beaten. “The constitution they are teaching us is not broken by us – they themselves break the law. For example, it’s our right to protest,” one explained.

Mass detention is not a new tactic for a government that has largely failed to move Ethiopia on from an authoritarian past. There have been similar initiatives during these Oromo protests, Human Rights Watch said in June, while thousands have also been detained in Amhara. After the disputed elections in 2005, when Ethiopia faced its last major political crisis, the US state department said up to 18,000 youths were kept at a military camp for longer than a month.

While the regime undertakes another mass roundup of suspects, the efforts to indoctrinate Oromo youth are increasingly futile, Hassen believes. “If anything, it makes people even more defiant,” he said. “It’s exposing how empty the regime is, making it more vulnerable.”

Ethiopia’s crisis developed after only one opposition lawmaker won a federal parliamentary seat in 2010 and last year’s election produced no opposition representative. The multi-ethnic ruling coalition emphasises its success in building infrastructure, improving social services, and helping millions out of extreme poverty, while acknowledging the democratic deficit.

Donor support for the government, which is also a security ally in Somalia and South Sudan, is unwavering. That relationship gives officials leeway to reject western criticism of abuses as a neocolonial attempt to impose liberal norms. Ethiopia’s leaders believe democratic pluralism is the product of development, not a means to achieve it.

When parliament reconvened, the largely ceremonial president, Mulatu Teshome, an Oromo, promised to create jobs and introduce some proportional representation at elections. And using familiar refrains, the government blamed Egypt and Eritrea for stoking the violence by backing a weakened, fragmented Oromo rebel group.

But the primary threat to Ethiopia is that a portion of its population is now committed to liberating regime change, rather than campaigning for reforms – including the young Oromo the police tried to re-educate. “Until we get our freedom, our self-determination as Oromo, I will continue struggling. I will continue to death,” said one.

The number of justices of the peace in England and Wales has declined sharply from 30,000 in 2006 to 17,500 now. Court closures, falling crime rates and a relative increase in the number of full-time district judges have all been blamed for the decline.

Campaign groups have responded to the justice select committee report by saying the magistracy is “in crisis” after it found low morale and a lack of diversity among magistrates.

Around 53% of magistrates are women and 89% are white. Many benches have no or few members from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds. More than 86% are over the age of 50. “Rebalancing the age profile of the magistracy is unlikely to happen unless more is done to overcome the barriers facing employed magistrates,” the report notes. “We recommend the creation of a kitemark scheme that recognises and rewards employers who support the magistracy.”

A federal jury has cleared NBA star Derrick Rose and two of his friends of rape in a civil trial that put the legal definition of consent under scrutiny.

The jury of six women and two men declared the defendants not liable for damages on Wednesday after a two-week civil trial that channeled issues of sex, consent, race, money and celebrity into a Los Angeles courtroom.

After the verdict, reached after less than four hours of deliberation, some jury members grinned and posed with Rose for photos outside the courtroom. 



The jury sided against the alleged victim, who was depicted as a sexually adventurous gold-digger, despite tearful testimony that she had been drugged and raped. She had sought $21.5m in damages.



Upon hearing the decision, Rose cast his eyes to the floor and hugged his attorney; his accuser clamped her face in her hands in a prayer position.

It was a climactic finale to a trial that put the judicial system’s treatment of sexual assault cases under fresh scrutiny in the wake of controversy over the Stanford sexual assault case and allegations against Bill Cosby and Donald Trump.



The New York Knicks point guard declined to comment on the case. “I’m just focused on the season,” he told reporters before being driven away in an SUV.

In a statement issued later he said: “It was important to prove I did not do what I was accused of, even if it meant publicly sharing very private details.”

The alleged victim’s lawyer, Waukeen McCoy, called the outcome unjust and said his client was devastated. “I think it’s a shame for this country that a celebrity can come to court and slut-shame a woman.” Her legal team is weighing an appeal, he said.

Several jurors told reporters after the verdict that they found the defendants more credible than Doe. “I felt like she was playing us,” said one, who gave his name only as Jared.



“I think most of us believe it’s possible there are pieces of her story that were true, but there just wasn’t any evidence” said another unnamed juror.

The jury forewoman, Janet, said: “I don’t want to call her a liar ... I just didn’t feel there was enough evidence.”

The New York Post quoted one unnamed female juror: “We really tried to believe her. We tried our hardest.” But in the end her story “didn’t add up”.



Rose’s lawyer, Mark Baute, depicted the plaintiff as a manipulative liar who preyed on racist perceptions of black men to try extract a fortune even though she had welcomed the trio with “open arms and open legs”. He said he was “very happy the system worked” and lambasted the media for what he said was biased trial coverage.

Michael Monico, an attorney for Rose’s two co-defendants, Randall Hampton and Ryan Allen, said: “It’s amazing that one woman and her false claims could cause this much difficulty for these three men.”

Within minutes of the verdict, Adidas said it would continue sponsoring Rose: “Our partnership with Derrick remains unchanged.” Rose and his friends, who grew up together in Chicago, had been accused of trespassing, sexual battery and battery.

Sex and texts, sport and celebrity, claim and counter-claim, even, in a tragic sub-plot, the death of an investigating LAPD detective: it was a trial with conflicting, lurid details.



The central fact was this: Rose, 28, and his two friends visited the plaintiff’s LA apartment in the early hours of 27 August 2013 and had sex with her. The men said it was consensual. The plaintiff, known as Jane Doe to shield her identity, said she was too intoxicated to give consent.



As civil litigation, rather than a criminal trial, the defendants faced paying damages but not jail time or a criminal conviction. They were found not liable, as opposed to not guilty.

A criminal investigation by the LAPD remains open, but observers said the lack of physical evidence made charges unlikely.

In the interest of transparency and not prejudicing the jury, Judge Michel Fitzgerald lifted Doe’s anonymity once proceedings began. Most media outlets declined to use her real name but it seeped, along with photos and insults, on to the internet. Activists warned that this would deter victims from reporting sexual assaults.

Some legal analysts had queried Rose’s decision to gamble in court rather than settle. The New York Knicks point guard, the youngest player ever to win the NBA’s Most Valuable Player award, imperiled his career and sponsorship deals.

Wearing a dark suit, for almost two weeks he had sat under a clock, facing his alleged victim. They took turns facing ferocious barrages from opposing lawyers who accused them of lying, and worse.

Rose and his friends committed rape, Doe’s lawyer, McCoy, had said in closing arguments on Tuesday. “They have no remorse, they are not apologetic. She’s not looking for a quick dollar. She’s looking for accountability.”

Rose’s equally combative lawyer, Baute, called Doe a gold-digger who was exploiting racist stereotypes of black men to extort a fortune. “She wants money,” he said. “She lied 50 times on the stand.” The media, he added, “loves taking a black man down”.

Monico, the other defense lawyer, scorned Doe’s testimony tears: “She has no evidence, but she can cry.”

Much of the case hinged on text messages Doe and Rose exchanged on the disputed night. One side argued they showed she had not agreed to group sex. The other agued that the fact she could text, including with punctuation, undercut her claim to have been too drunk – and possibly drugged – to consent.

Doe and Rose had dated on and off for two years before the alleged assault. On the night of 26 August 2013 Doe went with a friend, Jessica “Kendra” Groff, to Rose’s rented Beverly Hills home. She became inebriated and after midnight took a taxi back to her apartment.

Rose, Hampton and Allen arrived there a short time later, had intercourse with her and left. The case hinged on whether Doe was too incapacitated to agree to sex.

Doe said she had blacked out, vomited and woke up around 3am to find the three men having sex with her but could not stop them and woke again after dawn with her dress around her neck, lubricant on her legs, a burning sensation between her legs and condoms around the bed.

She was distraught, and told some confidantes she had been raped, but confusion and embarrassment delayed her filing a case for two years, she said.

Concluding the case, Fitzgerald wished Doe the best, then turned to the basketball star and made a joke. “Mr Rose, my best wishes to you and your career – except when the Knicks play the Lakers.”

According to the advocacy group Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network, each year there are on average 288,820 victims of sexual assault in the US, most of whom do not report the crime.

The collapse of Doe’s case will likely draw comparisons with that of “Jackie”, who claimed to be the victim of a rape portrayed in a now discredited Rolling Stone article that is currently the subject of a defamation lawsuit. The magazine deleted a separate article, about the Rose trial, last week.

Is Oscar Wilde about be posthumously pardoned? In a symbolic gesture announced by the government on Thursday, deceased gay and bisexual men convicted of sexual offences that are no longer illegal will have their criminal records wiped.

Announcing the initiative, the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) said that no individuals would be named or singled out – leaving the status of past scandals unresolved.

If the historical homosexual crime is no longer illegal and involved a consensual act with someone over the age of 16, then those convicted will be deemed to have received a posthumous pardon. 



The complexity of the evidence that led to Wilde’s conviction in 1895 for gross indecency – including evidence of procuring male prostitutes – would make it difficult to assess. The gay rights organisation Stonewall suggested that the playwright and author, who was sentenced to two years hard labour in Reading jail, should now be entitled to a pardon.



The justice minister, Sam Gyimah, said that a clause would be introduced into the policing and crime bill. “It is hugely important that we pardon people convicted of historical sexual offences who would be innocent of any crime today,” he said. “Through pardons and the existing disregard process we will meet our manifesto commitment to put right these wrongs.”



The disregard process is already open to those who are alive and wish to remove from their criminal record any past sexual offences that are no longer illegal. They will be entitled to a statutory pardon under the new legislation.

In 2013 Alan Turing, the gay mathematician who broke the German Enigma codes, was posthumously pardoned by the Queen. He killed himself by taking cyanide in 1954, at the age of 41, following his conviction for gross indecency.

The MoJ said it would partially follow Lord Sharkey’s amendment to the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012 although it would grant a blanket pardon for those who have died and not investigate individual historical cases.

Sharkey said: “This is a momentous day for thousands of families up and down the UK who have been campaigning on this issue for decades. I am very grateful for the government’s support and the support of many of my colleagues in parliament.”

The government has declined to support a private members’ bill on the subject, brought forward by an SNP MP, John Nicolson, which is due to be debated in parliament later this week. 



Ministers said they fear that bill would allow some people to claim they have been cleared of offences that are still crimes – including sex with a minor and non-consensual sexual activity.

Gyimah said: “I understand and support the intentions behind Mr Nicolson’s bill, however I worry that he has not fully thought through the consequences. A blanket pardon, without the detailed investigations carried out by the Home Office under the disregard process, could see people guilty of an offence which is still a crime today claiming to be pardoned.” 



The MoJ said there would be no historical limit in relation to past offences. It declined to say whether Wilde would be among those deemed posthumously pardoned.

Nicolson, the former BBC newsreader and front bench SNP culture spokesman, told the Guardian that the former justice secretary Michael Gove had promised him government support for his private member’s bill. His would only backdate pardons to 1919. “I hope that the government will sit and read my bill carefully,” he said. “Mine would also be a blanket pardon. A lot of those people [who are alive] are very old and would not want their names listed.”

Paul Twocock, director of campaigns at Stonewall, said: “We welcome the government announcement to issue a posthumous pardon to all gay and bi men unjustly prosecuted for being who they are, but we don’t think it goes far enough. John Nicolson MP’s proposed bill closes a loophole that means some gay and bi men who are still alive and living with those convictions still can’t have them deleted, despite them being unjust and not illegal today. We urge the government to look at bringing this into their proposal.

“We also don’t agree with the government’s interpretation of John Nicolson MP’s bill – it explicitly excludes pardoning anyone convicted of offences that would still be illegal today, including non-consensual sex and sex with someone under 16.”

The American Civil Liberties Union is challenging a secret court to effectively turn its back on deciding the meaning of a broad swath of surveillance and cybersecurity laws without public disclosure.



A motion the ACLU is filing on Wednesday before the controversial foreign intelligence surveillance (Fisa) court, a panel that operates in secret, argues that the first amendment requires the release of numerous classified decisions between 2001 and 2015 that have established a legal foundation for expanding the government’s surveillance activities.

Among the Fisa court opinions sought is an interpretation of the seminal Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 that many suspect will shed light on a reported Yahoo program to scan vast amounts of users’ emails.

Critics of the court, most prominently Oregon Democratic senator Ron Wyden, have said its classified rulings amount to a body of “secret law” that discard congressionally enacted privacy restrictions. The court and its supporters in government rejoinder that the extraordinary sensitivity around US surveillance practices for national security objectives necessitate the secrecy.

While the major post-Edward Snowden surveillance reform, the USA Freedom Act of 2015, requires the Fisa court to release its “novel” interpretations of the law, it is less clear about mandating retroactive disclosure. The ACLU on Wednesday contended that the US cannot engage in a meaningful democratic debate about surveillance and cybersecurity without the release of many post-9/11 Fisa court decisions.

“These rulings are necessary to inform the public about the scope of the government’s surveillance powers today,” the ACLU argues in its disclosure motion.

After Snowden’s disclosures, the civil liberties group has had some success in compelling the Fisa court to declassify its major decisions. In September 2013, under challenge from the ACLU, the Fisa court released its interpretations that permitted the bulk collection of US phone records based on a section of the 2001 Patriot Act allowing the government to gather collect information “relevant” to a national security investigation.

However, that acquiescence from the Fisa court came after the Guardian had already revealed the existence of that program, as well as an internal National Security Agency history of post-9/11 surveillance expansion that extensively detailed the court’s decisions. Furthermore, the court considered that disclosure “discretionary”, rather than establishing a first amendment precedent.

Now the ACLU is asking for significantly broader releases of secret surveillance-law decisions.

“As the revelation of the Yahoo! order underscores, an unknown number of legal opinions and orders assessing the constitutionality of and statutory basis for the government’s surveillance activities remains hidden from the public,” the ACLU states in its motion.

The Fisa court opinions sought to include the Yahoo order; a measure delivered to Microsoft that gave the government access to users’ encrypted communications; a ruling addressing the government’s ability to track location data from bulk cellphone interception; an order allowing the CIA and FBI to collect massive amounts of financial data under the Patriot Act; and a measure addressing a government effort to compel technology companies to hand over proprietary source code for national-security exploitation.

Other Fisa court opinions sought to discuss restrictions on surveillance, including the circumstances under which the NSA cannot search through its massive troves of intercepted communications, and information sharing with private companies to guard against data breaches.

As the ACLU filed its motion with the court, Yahoo’s general counsel requested aid from the nominal chief of US intelligence in addressing public anxieties around the reported email scanning program.

Yahoo lawyer Ron Bell said that the company is “unable to respond in detail” to “broad speculation” about the program due to US classification rules, and US director of national intelligence James Clapper was “well positioned to clarify this matter of public interest”.

Bell urged Clapper in a Wednesday letter to “confirm whether an order, as described in these media reports, was issued” and to “declassify in whole or in part such an order, if it exists”.

The taxpayer is facing a multimillion-pound legal bill after a supreme court judge found against HM Revenue and Customs in a four-year battle with the financial adviser Ingenious Media, a promoter of controversial film investment schemes.



HMRC was on Wednesday found to have breached its duty of confidentiality after a senior executive at the agency gave an off-the-record briefing to the Times in 2012, in which he described film investment partnerships as “scams for scumbags”.

Ingenious has been awarded costs, which could run to £5m, and is now deciding whether to seek compensation. The firm has previously sought damages of £20m in its battle against HMRC. 



Founded by the celebrity accountant Patrick McKenna, Ingenious devised ways to use film investment rules introduced by the Labour government to minimise tax for its wealthy clients. It attracted investment from a host of famous names, including Spice Girls Geri Halliwell and Melanie Chisholm, TV stars Anthony McPartlin and Declan Donnelly, singer Robbie Williams and former Big Brother presenter Davina McCall. 



McKenna’s net worth is estimated at £400m, but his firm’s reputation has suffered. He was hauled before parliament’s public accounts select committee in 2012, and three of his schemes have been challenged by HMRC, which claims to have saved hundreds of millions after taking Ingenious to tax tribunals.

In June 2012, two Times journalists had a background briefing on tax-avoidance schemes with Dave Hartnett, the then permanent secretary for tax at HMRC. It had been agreed the meeting was off the record, which Hartnett said he understood to mean that nothing would be published.

However, a week later some of his comments appeared in a Times article as coming from a “senior Revenue official”. The article included statements that McKenna had “never left my radar”, that “he’s a big risk for us”, that “we would like to recover lots of tax relief he’s generated for himself and for other people” and that “we’ll clean up on film schemes over the next few years”.

Hartnett also said Ingenious was one of two main providers of film investment schemes in the UK, which had enabled investors to avoid at least £5m in tax.

McKenna responded by launching a defamation action, which he later dropped in favour of a claim for judicial review. His case was dismissed by the high court, and by the court of appeal. But the supreme court has now found in his favour, saying HMRC breached the duty of confidentiality it owed to Ingenious as a taxpayer.

“The fact that Mr Hartnett did not anticipate his comments being reported is in itself no justification for making them,” Lord Toulson, the supreme court justice, said in his ruling. “The whole idea of HMRC officials supplying confidential information about individuals to the media on a non-attributable basis is, or should be, a matter of serious concern.”

Toulson agreed with HRMC that the information shared by Hartnett was limited in scope, but said it was not insignificant given the use the newspaper articles made of it.

The tax office had justified arranging the briefing on the grounds that it wanted to foster good relations with the media and publicise its views about elaborate tax avoidance schemes. Toulson said these arguments “cannot possibly justify a senior or any other official of HMRC discussing the affairs of individual taxpayers with journalists”.

Section 18 of the Commissioners for Revenue and Customs Act 2005 states officials “may not disclose information which is held by the Revenue and Customs in connection with a function of the Rvenue and Customs”.

However, tax campaigners such as the MP Margaret Hodge argue the confidentiality rules should be reformed. They say greater transparency is needed, for example on tax settlements with big companies and high net worth individuals.

A HMRC spokesperson said: “Having earlier won this case in both the high court and court of appeal, HMRC is naturally disappointed by the judgment handed down by the supreme court.

“It is important to clarify that this judgment has no bearing on the three Ingenious film partnerships considered by the first-tier tribunal, where HMRC was successful. This protected around £400m in revenues for the exchequer.”

Ingenious declined to comment on whether it would now seek damages, or on how much compensation it might seek. The firm sold its investment management arm, which managed £1.8bn on behalf of its high net worth clients, to private equity earlier this year.



“What this isn’t about is restricting HMRC’s ability to collect taxes,” said the Ingenious chief executive, Neil Forster. “Nor is it about restricting the freedom of the press to pursue public interest stories. This is about the principle of protecting taxpayer confidentiality and ensuring that information isn’t used by HMRC contrary to its own guidelines in order to pursue relationships with the press.”

The international criminal court has convicted a former vice-president of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and four members of his legal team of interfering with witnesses.

The verdicts against Jean-Pierre Bemba and his legal team marked the first time the court has found suspects guilty of attempting to pervert the course of justice.

The importance of the ruling was underscored by the presiding judge, Marc Perrin de Brichambaut. He said: “It has become apparent in the short time span of the court’s existence that preventing offences against the administration of justice is of the utmost importance.”

Bemba’s attempts to influence his trial ultimately failed. Earlier this year he was convicted and sentenced to 18 years imprisonment for commanding a militia – the Congolese Liberation Movement (MLC) – that committed mass rape, murder and pillage in neighbouring Central African Republic in 2002-2003.

That conviction was the ICC’s first verdict to recognise rape as a weapon of war and to employ the doctrine of command responsibility: that leaders are accountable for the crimes of their subordinates. 



Three trial judges found Bemba responsible as military commander for the war crimes of the 1,500-strong MLC as it sought to overturn a coup against the then CAR president, Ange-Félix Patassé.

The judges said Bemba could at any point have ended the MLC’s five-month rampage but chose not to.

The rights of Irish citizens to emigrate to Britain will need to be enshrined in law if their assumed “special status” is to continue, according to legal experts.



The Irish have more rights than other EU citizens in Britain because of the historical ties between the two countries, such as the right to vote and the right to stand for public office, including Westminster.

It has been widely assumed that this comes from the special historical links between the two countries and specifically the 1949 Ireland Act, which officially ended the country’s status as a British dominion.

But Bernard Ryan, professor of migration law at Leicester University, said this was a vague statement and if it were challenged might not have much legal value. “There is some sort of political consensus and the Ireland Act has some sort of legal aspiration, but I would not say it in itself protects the rights of the Irish,” he said.

The act was designed to treat the Irish the same as Commonwealth citizens, who in 1949 had the right to emigrate to Britain.

Irish and Commonwealth citizens were both subsequently subjected to immigration controls. In the case of Irish citizens, the controls never amounted to anything in practice as they were cancelled out by an exemption that came into force on the same day as the the immigration (control of entry through Republic of Ireland) order 1972.

This exemption, under common travel area legislation, means that to this day there is no legal requirement to show a passport when crossing the British/Irish borders, although there are rights to deport undesirables.

Ryan is one of the few lawyers examining the unique position of Irish citizens in detail. He has been cited in a post-Brexit House of Commons briefing paper on the “special status of Irish nationals in UK law”.

He said: “The minimum needed would be some sort of political statement on immigration and future rights of Irish citizens. But I feel in reality something has to be written into immigration legislation going forward.”

The right to vote is probably the least contentious issue as it is provided for in the Representation of the People’s Act 1983 and was reciprocated by Ireland in 1984.



The chances of EU citizens settled in Britain retaining all their rights to live, work and retire in the UK after Brexit have been rated at zero by legal experts.



A leading barrister who specialises in international public law told a House of Lords panel in September that it was inconceivable that the laws would survive entirely intact.



Prof Alan Vaughan Lowe QC said this was the price millions of people – including 1.3 million Britons abroad and 3 million non-Britons living in the UK – were likely to pay for Brexit.

Such was the uncertainty surrounding negotiations and the demands of other EU states, he said, that the British government might have to consider compensation for British citizens abroad if some rights, such as access to Spanish or French healthcare, were lost.



But Lowe told the Lords’ justice subcommittee that what worried him most was the lack of knowledge about the issue at government level. “There is very little evidence of people knowing what they are trying to do,” he said.

Magistrates’ powers should be increased so that they can sentence convicted defendants to up to one year in prison for a single offence, a House of Commons committee has recommended. The report by the justice select committee also calls for clearer government strategy to tackle “low morale” in the service and suggests that companies should be rewarded for allowing employees time off to sit on the bench.



The number of justices of the peace in England and Wales has declined sharply from 30,000 in 2006 to 17,500 now. Court closures, falling crime rates and a relative increase in the number of full-time district judges have all been blamed for the decline.

The government has so far resisted extending the magistracy’s sentencing powers from a maximum of six months to 12 months for a single offence. The authority for it to do so already exists under section 154 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, but it has never been brought into force.

Ministers fear a surge in the prison population through more punitive sentencing, although the Ministry of Justice said it could not provide the committee with any accurate modelling of the effect of the change.

“Most of the evidence that we received from magistrates supported the commencement of section 154, a move that would be seen as signalling trust in the magistracy and providing a boost to its morale,” the report declares. The provision would also allow magistrates to hand out sentences of up to 15 months for two or more offences.

Preventing many cases from going to the crown court for a more expensive jury trial, it has been claimed, would produce significant savings.

Around 53% of magistrates are women and 89% are white. Many benches have no or few members from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds. More than 86% are over the age of 50. “Rebalancing the age profile of the magistracy is unlikely to happen unless more is done to overcome the barriers facing employed magistrates,” the report notes. “We recommend the creation of a kitemark scheme that recognises and rewards employers who support the magistracy.” 



It also suggests that the MoJ should consider introducing “equal merit” provisions for recruiting magistrates to boost diversity – which would allow those from less well-represented backgrounds to be chosen if candidates are of otherwise equal merit. 



The report also heard that some magistrates feel they do not sit often enough, while others felt that case-hardened district judges were able to “cherry-pick” the most interesting cases. 



The Conservative MP Bob Neill, who chairs the committee, said: “It is unfortunate that the government’s evident goodwill towards the magistracy has not yet been translated into any meaningful strategy for supporting and developing it within a changing criminal justice system. This needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency.

“Although evidence does not indicate a universal problem, there is sufficient evidence of low morale within the magistracy to cause concern. Magistrates should be consulted on any further changes to the criminal justice system, especially those likely to have an impact on their role.”

Commenting on the report, Chris Brace, chief executive of the Magistrates Association, said: “It’s very encouraging that the committee has accepted our case for 12 months’ sentencing jurisdiction. We now hope that the government will follow suit by enacting dormant legislation.

“Retaining these cases in the magistrates’ courts will speed up justice for all court-users, especially victims, enabling magistrates to give more proportionate sentences at the right level. This is a golden opportunity for the government to show how much it trusts the magistracy to deliver justice.”

Penelope Gibbs, a former magistrate and director of the campaign group Transform Justice, said: “This report shows that the magistracy is in crisis. There are 12,000 fewer magistrates now than in 2008. This in itself has led to low morale, but magistrates are also unhappy that the most complex work is sometimes taken by district judges and that changes have been imposed on them. 



“Magistrates themselves have lighted on increased sentencing powers … as the answer to their problems. It would give magistrates’ courts more work, but it risks increasing prison numbers and decreasing the number of trials heard by juries. The government and the senior judiciary need to halt the downward drift in magistrate numbers and devise a strategy to save the magistracy, not enact one measure which may have perverse effects.”

If it were less important for the victims and survivors of abuse, the tale of the biggest and most costly statutory inquiry ever launched would be a farce. But the scale of the responsibility of the independent inquiry into the institutional failure that allowed thousands of children to be abused over decades leached the humour from this afternoon’s Commons home affairs committee session with permanent secretary Mark Sedwill. After an hour of parrying and blocking MPs’ questions it felt damagingly like a high grade version of the institutional cover-ups that victims and survivors of abuse want the inquiry to expose.

Mr Sedwill was in an impossible position. The more he tried to argue that the independence of the inquiry into historic child abuse meant he could not know what was going on, the harder it was to understand why he had met the former chair, Dame Lowell Goddard, on at least two occasions. It was even more confusing that a member of the panel with which Dame Lowell was supposed to be working, Drusilla Sharpling, had actually raised her concerns with the Home Office in April this year, several months before Dame Lowell’s abrupt resignation in August.

The permanent secretary is impaled on the relationship between the inquiry, with its budget of £17m, and its sponsoring department, the Home Office. In a manner that must have appeared suspiciously opaque to victims and survivors of abuse, he tried to explain how an arm’s-length relationship can coexist alongside the home secretary’s power to hire and fire the inquiry’s chair. To those forgiving of the ways of Whitehall, this is an everyday expression of the kind of arrangement that keeps the bureaucracy moving; Mr Sedwill said the Home Office was insulated from the inquiry by an air gap. To the lay observer, it seems incomprehensible that the department, which has supplied a fifth of the inquiry’s staff, would not have got wind of the troubles at the top that led within weeks not only to the resignation of Dame Lowell, the third chair to exit unexpectedly, but also the departure of the inquiry’s counsel, Ben Emmerson QC, and its junior counsel, Elizabeth Prochaska.

From this afternoon’s committee hearings, first with the inquiry’s fourth chair, Professor Alexis Jay, and two members of her panel and then with Mr Sedwill, it is clear that concern about Dame Lowell’s management of the inquiry had been mounting for months. But under the terms of her appointment – and to protect her independence from government interference – she could be dismissed only with “concrete evidence” of misconduct or incompetence. Not only was the evidence lacking – and Dame Lowell strongly denies press reports of bullying and racist behaviour – but there would have been understandable alarm at the risk to the whole inquiry that would follow losing yet another leader. Yet in the struggle to keep proceedings on track, which included bringing in a facilitator to try to mediate between the chair and the advisory panel that she made clear she did not want – a damaging atmosphere of infighting and mistrust built up.

At the end of July, Mr Sedwill finally learned of the crisis. Less than a week later, following a report in the Times that she had spent three months of her first year abroad, Dame Lowell resigned. In an indication of Whitehall panic, she took a £60,000 payoff to which her contract (it now emerges) did not entitle her. The inquiry is now in the charge of Professor Jay. If anyone can restore faith in the process, the woman who untangled the Rotherham sex abuse scandal has the best chance. This must surely be the final chapter.

Leading criminal barristers are concerned that victims of sexual attacks may be “scared off” from coming forward by the “over-reaction” of some women’s rights campaigners following the Ched Evans rape verdict.

Some commentators have suggested that a decision to allow the complainant’s sexual history to be used by Evans’s defence has created a “rapists’ charter” and set the law back three decades.

But the chair and vice-chair of the Criminal Bar Association told the Guardian that such language was counterproductive and could undermine confidence in the rules designed to protect victims of sex crimes.

Francis FitzGibbon QC, chair of the association, said: “There’s been a huge over-reaction to what this case means. The answer is not very much. The thing that troubles me is people saying it sets the law back 30 years and it’s a rapists’ charter. That is what is going to make people think they daren’t report what’s happened to them. Those cries of anguish are a self-fulfilling prophesy.”

Evans, a Welsh football international, was convicted in 2011 of raping a 19-year-old waitress and spent two-and-a-half years in prison. But following a well-funded campaign that included a £50,000 reward for information leading to his acquittal, his case was quashed on appeal and a retrial ordered.

The new evidence came from two former sexual partners of the complainant, who testified that her sexual behaviour with them – and the language she used – was similar to Evans’s account of how she had acted with him during consensual sex.

At the heart of the appeal was section 41 of the of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999, which prevents a complainant’s sexual history being used in court apart from in exceptional circumstances.

Following Evans’s acquittal on Friday, the women’s rights activist Julie Bindel claimed: “The Ched Evans acquittal, and the way his defence was run, has led to a rapists’ charter.”

Vera Baird, a former solicitor general for England and Wales and now a police and crime commissioner, said the decision had put the law back 30 years.

FitzGibbon said: “The law on section 41 makes it very, very difficult to introduce evidence of someone’s previous sexual behaviour unless the judge is persuaded it would result in an unfair verdict if it wasn’t put.



“There’s an understandable emotional reaction when something like this happens. When you step back and look at what it actually does it’s an over-reaction.”

On Baird’s stance, FitzGibbon added: “Vera has for many years been a redoubtable champion of women’s rights and I’m sure she genuinely believes this a backward step for the rights of women in the criminal justice system and in society. But I happen to disagree with her. I don’t think it is. I think the language that she and others have used is counterproductive and is probably more likely to scare people off than the law itself.”

Angela Rafferty QC, vice-chair of the Criminal Bar Association and an expert on the law around sexual offences, said: “Sometimes cases involving celebrities can be a blessing in highlighting important issues.”

But she added: “It is a disservice to victims of sex offenders to misinform them that the Ched Evans case has put the law back 30 years or has made it a rapists’ charter. That case has not changed the law. The law forbids questions about the previous sexual behaviour of a complainant in sexual offence cases, except in highly unusual circumstances where the trial would be unfair, and a wrongful conviction might result, if the evidence was not given.

“The court of appeal thought Evans’s was such a case. Cases like Evans’s will remain wholly exceptional. There is no relaxation of the rule against this type of questioning.”

This government’s “neither confirm nor deny” mantra over the extent of its surveillance powers has been replaced with a new one: “Never apologise, never explain.” On Monday, the tribunal tasked with hearing complaints against our intelligence agencies found that for more than a decade our intelligence agencies had been unlawfully amassing, in bulk, vast amounts of our personal data.

The official public response from the government didn’t touch on the 17 years of unlawful practice, but merely declared it was “pleased the tribunal has confirmed the current lawfulness of the existing bulk communications data and bulk personal dataset regimes”. While underplaying the significance of this ruling, the government is ebullient about how Theresa May’s investigatory powers bill – more commonly known as the snooper’s charter – will usher in a new era of transparency, honesty and rigorous oversight.

So if you are one the many people concerned about following the rules and how the public’s personal data is being protected, what is the government doing to reassure you? Very little.

Instead, the unwillingness to confront the government’s past mistakes reinforces the dangers inherent when parliament is asked to grapple with legislation such as the investigatory powers bill that would enshrine far-reaching, highly advanced and deeply intrusive surveillance powers. Rather than drawing a line under bad practice and forging a new era of transparent, clearly avowed and properly authorised and regulated surveillance, the bill is so byzantine and complex that it could lead to another 17 years of creative interpretation of the rules. This ruling should be a warning to all of us that when we give the government an inch, it will take a mile.

Let us be clear about what it has done when it says it has been collecting “bulk communications data”. Rather than seek the creation of transparent and democratically approved laws, it instead spent 17 years using an archaic, obscure, vague clause from a pre-internet piece of legislation – section 94 of the Telecommunications Act 1984 – to obtain regular feeds of bulk communications data from telecommunications companies.

In short, the government has been collecting your personal data from your phone and email provider – who you’ve been communicating with, when you communicated with them, where you were at the time. This data provides a detailed picture of who you are, your friendships and family relationships, your interests and movements, including your political views, your sexuality and who knows what else. And the government has been taking it all in for over a decade. Without you knowing about it. Without even parliament knowing about it.

The first official, independent review of these section 94 directions came out only in July this year. Sir Stanley Burnton, the interception of communications commissioner, who conducted the review, commented somewhat understatedly that there were “difficulties when statutes are operated in secret and where there is a lack of statutory codified procedures”.

“Difficulties” is one way to put it. The potential for abuse, misuse and skirting the rule of law is another. What we have seen emerge from disclosed documents is that the cloak of secrecy resulted in massive troves of our personal data becoming a kind of Facebook for spies. Staff had to be repeatedly warned not to search for or access information about other members of staff, neighbours, friends, acquaintances, family members and public figures.

Other independent experts have revealed further abuses. David Anderson QC, the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, noted at para 5.42 of his review of bulk powers that a “very serious incident” took place in 2014. Burnton noted “230 errors” by the security service between January 2015 and July 2016.

Missing from the narrative is what happened to the victims. With no provisions for notification, we will never know if our data was misused, however egregious the incident. The investigatory powers bill takes a tiny step in the right direction by allowing for error reporting in limited, discretionary circumstances. But that is not nearly enough. Error reporting should be mandatory to give us effective rights to seek redress.

Of even greater concern than abuse, however, is the threat to a democratic society created when we normalise that idea of putting us all under surveillance. But neither the government nor parliament has fully confronted the main consequence of the bill, which enshrines in law the powers of bulk surveillance that led to the collection of all our data. Parliament has been hobbled by the many layers of this enormous, complex mostly unfathomable piece of legislation, accompanied by hundreds of pages of equally opaque codes of practice. It is true that we have moved on from an era of a vacuum in law. But what we have got instead is a new era of legal labyrinthian complexity.

So, with the investigatory powers bill just weeks from becoming law, we find ourselves at the precipice of the post-Snowden surveillance settlement. Rather than rolling back the mass surveillance practices that have been exposed in the aftermath of Edward Snowden blowing the whistle, some of which Monday’s judgment finally found to be unlawful, May’s bill is hurtling forward like a freight train. If it fails to change course, we may again find ourselves in court challenging the state’s mass surveillance practices. While it is the 11th hour, it is not too late for parliament to stop this vicious cycle of unlawfulness that thrives on rules that no one understands.

Over the last couple of years I have written several items on this blog about the worrying lack of plurality in the Irish media market.

I have pointed in particular to the fact that a billionaire businessman, Denis O’Brien, owns far too wide a range of media outlets. And I have argued that such a concentration of ownership poses potential threats to Ireland’s democracy.

Now comes a report by four lawyers at two UK-based legal firms which raises similar concerns and calls on the Irish government to intervene.

In the report, “on the concentration of media ownership in Ireland”, the authors state: “we consider there to be a perfect storm which poses grave risks to freedom of expression and media pluralism in the Irish market”.

That storm is composed of O’Brien’s reach through newspapers and radio holdings in company with his penchant for issuing writs against rival media outfits.

To recap, O’Brien is the largest shareholder in Independent News & Media (INM), which publishes Ireland’s two best-selling newspapers, plus the Sunday World and Dublin Herald.

It also owns the Belfast Telegraph, 50% of the Irish Daily Star and 13 paid-for regional weeklies (with seven more soon to be acquired).



According to the INM website, it manages gross assets of €187.6m and is the largest newspaper contract printer and wholesale newspaper distributor on the island of Ireland.

Then comes radio. O’Brien is chairman and principal shareholder of Communicorp, which owns Ireland’s two leading commercial radio talk stations, Newstalk and Today FM. In addition, it owns Dublin’s 98FM, SPIN 1038, TXFM (soon to close) and SPIN South West.

However, the state’s public service broadcaster, RTÉ, is dominant in radio (and TV). It has been calculated, in an October 2015 study, that Communicorp has a 20% share of the Irish radio market. The company, citing “industry standard methodology”, has challenged this, arguing that it is 16%.

Whatever the case, INM’s newspaper dominance in addition to Communicorp’s radio assets anchors O’Brien as the country’s major private media mogul.

But there is another aspect to O’Brien’s activities that exercises the new report’s authors: Caoilfhionn Gallagher and Jonathan Price of London’s Doughty Street Chambers, and Gavin Booth and Darragh Mackin of KRW Law in Belfast.

Arguing that Ireland has “one of the most concentrated media markets of any democracy”, they contend that this “alarming” feature has to be viewed alongside another “gravely concerning aspect of the Irish media landscape”.

This is the “sustained and regular threats of legal action by Mr O’Brien to media organisations and journalists who are engaged in newsgathering or reporting about his activities.”

And this has to be seen in the light of what the authors call the “chilling effect” of Ireland’s current defamation laws. They argue: “This is a toxic combination for freedom of expression and media plurality”.

They believe it “imperative that urgent action is taken” and dismiss “suggestions that this is a constitutional no-go area, or an European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) no-go area”.

But they concede that retroactive action to break up media holdings “is a difficult area... affecting property rights and impacting upon an existing market”.

So they call for a “detailed multi-disciplinary analysis” to consider “complex and nuanced issues... including how precisely to measure plurality”.

To that end, they conclude: “We recommend that the government establish a cross-disciplinary commission of inquiry” in order to examine the issues “and make concrete recommendations, within a tight time frame”.

The authors were commissioned to compile a legal opinion by the Sinn Féin MEP Lynn Boylan on behalf of the European parliament’s left-wing grouping GUE/NGL.

Boylan presented the study to the European Centre for Press and Media Freedom in Leipzig on 6 October. She will launch it in Ireland next Monday (24 October), at the Cliff Town House on St Stephen’s Green, Dublin, 2.30-4pm.

NB: If you happened to be wondering who might be the third-largest media owner in Ireland (after O’Brien and RTÉ) it is Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp, with Sky plus the Irish editions of the Sun, Times and Sunday Times. It is currently acquiring the Wireless Group (formerly UTV Media) with holdings that include six Irish local radio stations (including FM104) and a Belfast outlet.

This is Spinal Tap star Harry Shearer is suing Vivendi, the parent company of Universal Music and StudioCanal, alleging it has withheld millions of dollars in profits owed to the creators of the cult 80s rock mockumentary.

Shearer, who co-wrote the film and soundtrack and starred as bassist Derek Smalls, has lodged the legal action at the Central District Court of California.



Shearer, who has voiced 23 characters on The Simpsons including Ned Flanders and Mr Burns, is claiming $125m (£102m) in compensatory and punitive damages from the French conglomerate.



Vivendi acquired the rights to This is Spinal Tap, through its subsidiary StudioCanal, in 1989. 



Shearer claims that since then, profits from This is Spinal Tap have not been fairly shared between its four creators, cast or crew.



“This is a simple issue of artists’ rights,” said Shearer. “It is stunning that after all this time, two cinema releases, all the various home-video format releases, all the records and CDs, and all the band-themed merchandise still widely available worldwide, the only people who haven’t shared Spinal Tap’s success are those who formed the band and created the film in the first place.”



This is Spinal Tap was created by Shearer, Christopher Guest, who went on to co-write and direct dog competition mockumentary Best in Show, Rob Reiner and Michael McKean.



The legal complaint alleges that between 1989 and 2006, Vivendi reported that the total income from soundtrack music sales was just $98.



And in addition, it claims Vivendi reported that the four creators’ share of total worldwide merchandising income between 1984 and 2006 was $81.



The lawsuit names Ron Halpern, who has been in charge of international productions and acquisitions for StudioCanal since 2007, as a co-defendant in the claim. Vivendi’s agents are named as StudioCanal and Universal Music.



“Though I’ve launched this lawsuit on my own, it is in reality a challenge to the company on behalf of all creators of popular films whose talent has not been fairly remunerated,” said Shearer. “I hope this lawsuit will help set a new precedent for … fair artistic compensation industry-wide.”



In 1982, the four co-creators signed an agreement with Embassy Pictures for the production, financing and distribution of This is Spinal Tap.



Shearer claims the agreement included profit participation payments at 40% of net receipts bases on all sources of revenue, including merchandise and music.



The film, which had a shoe-string budget of $2.25m, was released in 1984 and became a global cult classic.



Vivendi acquired the rights to Spinal Tap in 1989, and Shearer’s legal action claims it began a “concerted and fraudulent campaign to hide, or grossly underreport, the film’s revenues in order to avoid its profit participation obligations”.



A Vivendi spokesman declined to comment on the legal action.

While the Modern Slavery Act consolidated and improved our modern laws on trafficking and slavery, it didn’t create any jurisdiction for the crimes of slavery or forced labour that are committed by UK nationals or companies overseas.



If a British person or company holds a person in slavery or forced labour abroad – such as on construction sites in the Gulf states or in the fishing industry – they can do so with impunity, unless their behaviour is criminalised in that state.

Yet any profits obtained from the slavery and extreme exploitation of workers can filter home to the UK company, crime-free.



Having worked and advised extensively at a high level on the legal issues of modern-day slavery for well over a decade, I believe new legislation is required to criminalise slavery and forced labour committed overseas and impose harsh criminal penalties in the UK.



At present the only requirement on companies under the act is to write a statement showing their efforts to eradicate slavery in their supply chain and publish it on their websites.

I can imagine that business will say that is sufficient. But as consumers we need a stronger incentive for companies to confront and prevent slavery in the supply chains they receive goods and services from.

Extending our criminal law to cover cases where UK-based or UK-linked businesses intentionally or recklessly engage in slavery or forced labour in their supply chains overseas would plug the gap.

Let’s not forget that it is often in countries where there is a weak rule of law or an absence of fair worker rights that slavery, forced labour and trafficking thrive.

The law currently says if we commit a slavery crime, we will be punished. Why not then the UK companies and individuals who are engaged in supply-chain slavery overseas and profit from the labour of the enslaved?

The fact that we need to change a law that only recently came into force is not unusual or unprecedented. If we look back in history we see that all of our slavery-related legislation has had an incremental approach. There were dozens of pieces of English legislation that finally enabled the abolition of the transatlantic slave trade in all of its form 200 years ago.

It is only through seeing the law in action that we recognise where the gaps lie. The UK criminal offence of holding a person in slavery or requiring a person to perform forced labour was only passed in 2009, when the legislation gap was exposed by one of my cases, and it soon became the most successful modern criminal legislation geared towards prosecuting and convicting those who enslave.

We already have extra-territorial jurisdiction for some very serious crimes. If we think about child sexual exploitation cases involving British people, such as in Kenya, these people can be prosecuted in the UK. The crime of torture can be prosecuted here too, wherever it took place. Corporate acts of slavery and forced labour abroad need to be treated with the same seriousness.



We also have the resources ready to investigate companies. Police forces in the UK, admittedly some better than others, have expertise in trafficking and cross-border investigations. They would be able to investigate the slavery complaints of overseas victims and track slavery and forced labour in the overseas supply chains of UK companies, if the legislation could be extended.

As well as holding UK companies operating overseas accountable, we also need to extend our domestic slavery law to allow victims of slavery and trafficking in the UK to properly sue their enslavers and traffickers for civil compensation.



Victims can currently seek compensation in the UK via existing laws. But these traditional compensation laws don’t cover the full spectrum of harm done by traffickers and enslavers, including their use of subtle yet terrifying means of control, psychological abuse and damage, deception, coercion, the destruction of one’s identity, taking a child into slavery, or debt-bondage.

If victims had a clear right to civil compensation under British law for slavery, trafficking or forced labour they could bring a claim for damages against those responsible and it would also have a very serious impact on making businesses more accountable for slavery in their supply chains, as well as those individuals who enslave and traffic. The vast majority of trafficking and slavery cases don’t end up in the criminal courts after all.



In the US there is already a direct civil remedy for trafficking and forced labour in law, introduced in 2003. It was designed to give compensation to victims but also act as a deterrent. In my experience, the best compensation laws for trafficking take this two-pronged approach.

Recently, a US company Signal International was found liable and forced to pay compensation to trafficked workers it deceived, indebted and abused on its construction sites after Hurricane Katrina. After losing a court case under the trafficking compensation laws the company later filed for bankruptcy. It was a chilling warning to companies across the US that they are liable for all the trafficking-related harm done to their victims.



Civil compensation laws in the UK should be similarly clear: if you traffic or enslave people you will pay your victims for the harm you have done. We now need to modernise our Modern Slavery Act to do just that.

For decades now, we’ve known that our memories are not as infallible as we like to think. And with research now showing that researchers are able to plant entirely novel memories that never actually happened – the need for psychological research in the courtroom has never been more pressing. But as we find out, the world of false memory is a murky and uncertain one.

Helping Ian Sample clear the way this week is London South Bank University Criminologist and Expert Witness Dr Julia Shaw, and – one of the field’s most prominent pioneers - Professor Elizabeth Loftus, who bravely used much of her expertise during the “Satanic Panic” of the 1980s.

The Australian government should urgently review the Border Force Act’s secrecy provisions and improve protections for whistleblowers in the immigration detention system, a United Nations special rapporteur has said.

The UN independent expert Michel Forst made the recommendation while launching a report that concludes that Australian governments have effectively gagged civil society advocates with secrecy laws, funding cuts and restrictive contracts that prevent them speaking up about human rights abuses.

Civil society groups including Save the Children have welcomed the preliminary findings, which Forst presented in Canberra on Tuesday after a two-week visit meeting human rights defenders.

Forst said Australia had “hundreds of secrecy laws that unnecessarily restrict access to government information”, including the Border Force Act and state anti-protest laws. These formed part of “mounting evidence of a range of cumulative measures” putting pressure on civil society groups and increasing the disparity between Australia’s commitments to the rule of law and its practice.

In particular, Forst singled out secrecy in the immigration portfolio, changes denying environmental advocates legal standing, cuts to community legal centres and gag clauses preventing advocacy by non-government organisations receiving grants.



“The immigration department has gone to extraordinary lengths to curb whistleblowers, public servants or contractors, to share information in the public domain about serious human rights abuses in offshore detention centres,” he said.

The Border Force Act contains a section criminalising the making of an “unauthorised disclosure” about conditions in detention camps, punishable by two years in prison.

Forst said aspects of the law that related to freedom of expression should be reviewed and the public interest disclosure framework “substantially strengthened … to ensure effective protection to whistleblowers”.

He said he was “astounded” at “frequent public vilification of rights defenders by senior government officials” to discredit and intimidate them. Media and businesspeople had “contributed to stigmatisation”, he said.

“Even the president of the Australian Human Rights Commission, Prof Gillian Triggs, faced government intimidation and public questioning of her integrity, impartiality and judgment after the commission’s inquiry into the child harm in immigration detention.”

High-profile whistleblowers such as Dr Peter Young, the former head of mental health for International Health and Medical Services, and Paul Stevenson, a traumatologist who worked on Nauru and Manus, have faced heavy recriminations for speaking out about abuses in offshore detention.

They, and others, have lost jobs, been publicly vilified and, in some cases, had their communications monitored, and police investigations launched into their activities. Friends and colleagues have been telephoned and harassed by police, seeking information about private conversations.

Wilson Security even took the extraordinary step of hiring a private investigator to “aggressively” pursue the sources of stories in the Guardian and other media outlets.

Forst said contractors such as Save the Children had been subjected to raids and egregious allegations of misconduct, removed from operations and had their personal and professional reputations targeted by politicians and media.



He said many activists spoke of an atmosphere of fear and censorship, and several defenders preferred not to meet with him for fear of retaliation.

Access to justice was restricted by clauses preventing appeal against immigration decisions, and reported attempts by the government to grant officers in detention centres immunity from criminal and civil liability.

The head of policy and public advocacy at Save the Children Australia, Mat Tinkler, told Guardian Australia Forst’s conclusions were “absolutely right”.

“The regime of secrecy on offshore processing means Australian taxpayers don’t have the opportunity to judge [its] merits ... they don’t have all the facts on the table,” he said.

“It forces staff to face an invidious choice: to face prosecution, or speak out about egregious child rights violations when nothing is being done to remedy them.”



Tinkler welcomed the recommendation to review the Border Force Act, noting that although there had been no prosecutions Forst found it had a chilling effect.

He said Save the Children had “a well-documented history of being attacked for being the messenger of bad news”. It had resulted in the “absence of a rights-based organisation providing support to vulnerable people in detention”, Tinkler said.

Forst noted that the government had introduced a bill to prevent individuals or organisations that have engaged in environmental activities in the past two years from challenging decisions under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act.

The government had used “vitriolic language” to describe those bringing legal challenges, calling them “radical green activists” engaged in “vigilante litigation”.

Forst complained of “drastic defunding of peak bodies” including the total defunding of the Environmental Defenders Offices and the National Congress of Australia’s First Peoples.

Gagging clauses prevented organisations that received government funding from “doing any form of advocacy, which is contrary to the principle of a free and democratic society”, he said.

An Australian Conservation Foundation campaigner, Basha Stasak, welcomed the UN rapporteur’s findings that environmental campaigners had been “vilified” for legitimate legal action.

She called on the government to “take on board the recommendations that environmental groups have a legitimate interest in decision making and in the courts” and withdraw amendments to deny them standing and deprive them of tax-deductible status.

On Tuesday, Triggs told the Senate legal and constitutional affairs legislation committee that there had been “a real slipping back in our commitment to the rule of law and fundamental freedoms” in Australia.

Forst said the degradation of protections for civil society could be “reversed and improved” and called on the government to adopt a national action plan on human rights.

He will present a final report with his findings and recommendations to the UN human rights council in 2017. The government will be given an opportunity to comment on the factual aspects of the draft report before its final submission.

Forst’s visit will be followed by a visit from a special rapporteur on the human rights of migrants in November and in 2017, who will report on conditions in offshore detention on Manus Island and Nauru.

Nearly 60% of people in Northern Ireland believe abortion in the province should be decriminalised, a new survey has found. When asked whether abortion should be permitted for victims of rape, and in cases where the foetus cannot survive outside the womb, three-quarters of those polled agreed. 



Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK where abortion is illegal, except in the limited circumstances where continuing a pregnancy would put the mother’s life in direct danger. The 1861 Offences Against the Persons Act, which makes abortion a criminal offence, is punishable by a life sentence in prison.

Attempts by individual members of the Northern Ireland assembly to introduce limited abortion reform in the Stormont parliament have been met by opposition from the biggest party, the Democratic Unionists, as well as members of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party.

The public attitudes survey was conducted last month by local pollsters Millward Brown on behalf of Amnesty International, which backs abortion reform in Northern Ireland. The polling of 1,000 adults, carried out in September, found:

• 72% of people think abortion should be available if the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest; only 15% are opposed.

• 67% of people think abortion should be available in cases of fatal foetal abnormality; just 17% are opposed. 



• 58% of people think abortion should be decriminalised so that there would be no criminal penalty for women who have abortions in Northern Ireland; 22% are opposed to this change. 



• 59% of people think abortion should be decriminalised so there would be no criminal penalty for doctors and medical staff who assist women to have abortions in Northern Ireland; 21% are opposed to this change. 



• 68% of people think the fact that in most cases abortion is classified as a crime in Northern Ireland adds to the distress of women seeking an abortion; 14% disagree. 



• 75% of people think the fact that women from Northern Ireland who are seeking a lawful abortion must travel to Britain adds to their distress; 11% disagree.

Adrianne Peltz, Amnesty International’s Northern Ireland campaigner, said the findings reflected how the people were ahead of politicians in terms of liberalising abortion laws.

“These poll findings demonstrate an overwhelming demand for change to Northern Ireland’s draconian abortion laws,” she said. “This is not a small margin of support for women’s access to abortion – it’s a definitive landslide. Northern Ireland has changed.

“Not only do a huge majority of people in Northern Ireland want to see abortion made available to women and girls in the tragic circumstances of rape, incest or fatal foetal diagnosis, but they also want to see abortion decriminalised for all women. It’s time for these outdated laws to be brought into the 21st century.

“Decisions about women’s bodies should be made by women themselves, never by politicians, who should be aware that voters from all parties – including those who have previously blocked change – want to see a radical overhaul of these inhumane laws.”

Last November, Northern Ireland’s high court ruled that the region’s restrictive abortion laws breached the European convention on human rights in cases of fatal foetal abnormality and where the pregnancy resulted from sexual assault. The Northern Ireland executive has appealed against the judgment and a decision from the court of appeal is pending.

In April this year, a 21-year-old Northern Irish woman was given a three-month suspended prison sentence after being found guilty of taking abortion pills to end her pregnancy. The court was told that the woman, aged 19 at the time of the offence, could not afford to travel to England to have a lawful abortion.

On Tuesday, Amnesty International activists will hand over a petition of more than 45,000 names to the Northern Ireland executive at Stormont calling for a loosening of anti-abortion laws in the region.

Sir Cliff Richard has told MPs and peers he fears he will be “forever tainted” after being wrongly accused of sex offences.

The singer, who is suing the BBC and South Yorkshire police after a raid on his home was televised live, spoke at a private meeting on Monday as part of a campaign to guarantee anonymity for suspects accused of sex crimes.

He told an audience: “The TV circus took away from me all hope of ever being what I had been before, a confident and respected artist, and an ambassador for Great Britain. Had I not been ‘named’ worldwide I feel I would still have been able to look people in the eye and not feel afraid that they might be thinking that there is ‘no smoke without fire’.

“Instead, I fear I will forever be tainted by the lurid and intrusive coverage I received. I have had to bring civil proceedings to obtain redress for these appalling invasions of my privacy by the police and the BBC. But that can never undo all the damage I have suffered. It would have been so much better never to have been in this position at all.”

The 76-year-old told the meeting that he was grateful that his late sister, Donna, had lived long enough to hear that he had been cleared. “Only we who are innocent of any crime but who are named publicly before any charge has been brought, before even being arrested or interviewed by the police, will know the damage caused to our dignity, our standing, and our self-esteem. My name was traduced around the world in all the places where people know me. I believe that there were probably very few countries that did not hear of the ridiculous, appalling accusation made against me.”

Another speaker at the event at the House of Lords was broadcaster Paul Gambaccini, who was kept on police bail for 12 months after being arrested on suspicion of historical sex offences in 2013, before being told he would not be charged.



Lady Brittan, the widow of Lord Brittan, who was investigated as part of a doomed Scotland Yard inquiry into claims of a Westminster paedophile ring, also addressed the meeting. 



Security was enhanced in the corridor outside the House of Lords’ committee room, with Black Rod, the officer responsible for maintaining order, joining doorkeepers and police to keep tabs as the stars arrived.

Lady Brittan, the widow of Lord Brittan, who was investigated as part of a doomed Scotland Yard inquiry into claims of a Westminster paedophile ring, also spoke at the meeting. 



In March she was told that her late husband would have had no case to answer over the claims and received an apology for the force’s failure to tell Brittan before he died that he would face no further action over a separate claim. 



The calls for a change in the law are being led by a former police officer, Lord Paddick. The proposal to amend the policing and crime bill would make it illegal for anyone to publicly name someone arrested on suspicion of a sex crime, unless they were charged. 



Richard said in a separate written statement that seeing the raid on his home in August 2014 was “like watching my home being broken into – on television” and that he was not given the benefit of being presumed innocent until proven guilty.

The statement continued: “The situation was made more distressing by the fact that I had to sit by and helplessly watch police officers go through my possessions. I just collapsed. 



“The fact of the raid; the false insinuation that I was guilty, knowing that I was innocent; and of course the worldwide press coverage that followed the BBC’s decision to cover the raid, caused me a long period of distress, humiliation, anxiety and illness. As you would expect, I had trouble carrying on with life as normal. The stress was physical and not just mental.” 



He said that during the 22-month investigation he suffered from bouts of depression. The singer added: “If I can help bring about change, knowing that it will help others, even though I am all too aware that my own prior reputation will never be fully recovered (something I find devastating at this stage in my life), it will make everything that I’ve been through feel just a little bit more palatable.”

Before the meeting, the End Violence Against Women Coalition wrote an open letter to Richard, Gambaccini and Nigel Evans, the former Commons’ deputy speaker who was cleared by a jury of sex offence allegations in 2014, urging them to abandon the campaign. 



Co-directors of the campaign, Sarah Green and Rachel Krys, said: “We want more discussion of rape and justice, not less. We want more openness and ever better practise by police and the courts in rape cases. We want the media to change the way it reports on rape. 



“And in the long term, we don’t want anonymity for defendants because we don’t want it for those who allege rape either – because one day we will have eradicated the shame of being raped and made this offence one [that] can be openly tested in court like all others.” 



Richard Scorer, a specialist abuse lawyer at Slater and Gordon, the firm which represented victims including those of Rolf Harris and Max Clifford, said many dangerous criminals are only in jail because of publicity surrounding their arrest. 

Although police do not routinely name on arrest, with both Clifford and Harris, publicity after they were questioned led further victims to come forward.

The verdict of a jury last Friday that found Ched Evans not guilty of rape appears to be a devastating setback for justice for rape victims. The footballer admits that he had sex with a woman he barely knew, who was drunk, and to whom he addressed not a word. He was convicted by the first jury to try him in 2011. But at his retrial, the jury decided they could not be certain that the woman had not consented, a verdict they reached after they had heard evidence that she had behaved in a similar manner with two other men at around the same time. Everything about this case stinks. A rich young man who on his own admission behaved in a way that most people would find unacceptable is found not guilty, while his victim, a young woman who was only 19 at the time, has had to move house five times, change her identity twice after Twitter trolls outed her on social media, and now has her alleged sexual history spread over the tabloids.

It is true that not all the evidence that Mr Evans’ legal team finally won on was available at the first trial. A subsequent appeal against conviction was dismissed. Only after a new legal team was employed was the original evidence reconsidered and the witnesses re-interviewed. A new defence was presented to the Criminal Cases Review Commission. The court of appeal considered the new evidence and decided that it met the condition of “similar fact”: that meant there could be a retrial, and the new evidence of sexual behaviour could be introduced. Explaining her reasons, Lady Justice Hallett admitted she did so with “a considerable degree of hesitation”.

The judge was unquestionably fulfilling the requirements of the law as she understood it. But sometimes the law is wrong.

There is real concern that this sequence of events will make the prosecution of rape cases harder and reporting rarer. The verdict breathes fresh life into the old prejudice that how a woman has behaved in the past can be taken as evidence of the way she behaved at the time of the alleged rape, that – in the ancient formulation – “unchaste women are more likely to consent and less worthy of belief”. It will deter victims from going to the police for fear of having their private lives raked over; it could make convictions, already hard to achieve, even harder; and it will further embolden defence lawyers in rape trials who know how effective it is to apply for sexual history to be admissible, a tactic that even when it is disallowed has been shown to influence jurors’ opinion of the victim and lead to more acquittals – just when the leap of 123% in reported rape over the past five years already suggests England and Wales are facing an epidemic that neither police nor courts can keep up with.

Until the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act in 1999 outlawed the introduction of sexual history in most cases, it was a commonplace defence strategy. It took years of campaigning, and the election of a Labour government, before parliament finally accepted that the only relevant factor is consent, or a reasonable belief in consent. But late in the day, an exemption was introduced in the interests, the then home secretary Jack Straw argued, of justice for defendants. When the law lords considered the matter soon after, they decided that to protect the right to a fair trial, there were “rare” occasions when sexual history could be taken into account.

Last year almost 24,000 cases of rape were reported to police, twice as many as just four years ago. The great majority were women raped by men. When the statistics came out last week, organisations like Rape Crisis England welcomed the greater readiness of victims to go to the police. But, like the oracle of Delphi, they also warned of the continuing damage done by victim-blaming attitudes that deter women from coming forward. The trauma of rape, and the persistent claim that consent can be deduced rather than clearly established, all indicate that the use of sexual history needs to be looked at again.

The lead police officer on sex crimes for England and Wales sought to reassure victims they would be treated sensitively and seriously in the wake of the outcry over Ched Evans’ rape acquittal.

There has been a storm of criticism from women’s rights campaigners who fear victims may be reluctant to come forward having seen the sexual history and behaviour of the complainant in the Evans case being put before the jury in explicit detail.

The National Police Chiefs’ Council lead for adult sex offences, assistant commissioner Martin Hewitt, told the Guardian on Monday that forces would do all they could to support victims. “I want to assure victims of rape or sexual offences that they can report to us in the knowledge that they will be listened to, treated sensitively and with respect, and that their allegations will be taken seriously.”

The Evans case has happened at a hugely sensitive time. Last week it emerged that the number of rapes recorded by police has doubled in the past four years – while the percentage of allegations resulting in conviction has fallen.

Hewitt, a Met police officer, added: “We will do everything we can to take cases through the criminal justice system. The police are also able to help victims access specialist support services and medical treatment if they have not already done so. We will support victims of sexual offences in pursuing the route that is right for them.”



Evans, 27, a Welsh international and former Manchester City and Sheffield United striker, spent two and half years in prison after being convicted of raping a 19-year-old waitress at a hotel near the seaside town of Rhyl in north Wales.

A high-profile campaign was launched to clear his name, which included the offer of a £50,000 reward for information leading to his acquittal.

The appeal court quashed his conviction and ordered a retrial after new testimony was found from two witnesses who described the complainants’ sexual behaviour with them. It meant the complainant was questioned in excruciating detail in open court about intimate details of her sex life. Evans was found not guilty of rape by a jury at Cardiff crown court on Friday.

Rachel Krys, co-director of the End Violence Against Women Coalition, said her organisation would work with lawyers to examine the detail of the appeal court decision. “We want to understand how exactly this happened and make sure this is not giving the green light for defence barristers to get complainants’ sexual history into court except in the most exception of circumstances,” she said.

Lisa Longstaff, of Woman Against Rape (WAR), said it was concerned the case could provide a “gateway” for defence lawyers to routinely question alleged victims about their sexual history. WAR is planning to meet female MPs to lobby them on the issue.

Meanwhile, within a few hours of going live, more than 300 people donated to an appeal to raise money to be split between the complainant and the organisation Rape Crisis.

The appeal was launched by a feminist activist who goes by the pseudonym Jean Hatchet, who was behind petitions that asked football clubs not to sign Evans following his jail term. She is aiming to raise £50,000 – matching the reward offered by Evans’ camp.

Hatchet said the woman had been hounded, harassed, bullied and smeared in the years since the incident in 2011. “We don’t know how she has endured such an ordeal,” she said. “She sought nothing but help one morning when she awoke not knowing where she was or what had happened to her. What followed was not help, but hell.”

There have been unconfirmed reports that the complainant is contemplating leaving the UK for Australia to escape the abuse.

The footballer Ched Evans had much to say following his rape acquittal, and the weekend newspapers gave him a platform to say it. Now rape campaigners must come to terms with the legacy of his case. By clearing the way for two men to tell the jury they’d had sex with the complainant, the court of appeal effectively converted his earlier conviction into an acquittal. Some lawyers say this was a rare case and doubt that, as a precedent, it will affect many future cases. But other lawyers – and I am one of them – fear that rape trials could become inquisitions into the complainant’s sex life.

We seem to be returning to a mindset and practices we thought were confined to history. In seeking – as we now must – to find a new way forward, it’s worth recalling how we reached this point.

The fear of a complainant being confronted with evidence relating to sex with other men is, and has always been, a huge deterrent to reporting rape. In 1976 judges were given powers to prevent defence lawyers using that tactic, but the discretion they enjoyed was wide, unregulated and infrequently used. So a rape defendant could bring Mr B and Mr C to testify that the complainant had had consensual sex with them. The argument would run, she consented to me as well because she’ll have sex with anyone. The two arguments – she’s a tart and you can’t believe a word she says – were what women, not surprisingly, feared. These were the “twin myths” that flowed from the use of previous sexual history.

In 1999, the Labour government curtailed the use of complainants’ sexual conduct with other people as evidence of consent; but so entrenched was the perception among complainants that four years later a review of the legislation showed it was still a key factor in low reporting rates.

Whatever the truth of this kind of testimony, it was usually irrelevant to the charge itself. Lord Steyn, in the House of Lords case of R v A (No 2) referred to in Evans second appeal, said that: “Questioning and evidence about the complainant’s sexual experience with other men … are almost always irrelevant to the issue whether the complainant consented to sexual intercourse on the occasion alleged in the indictment or to her credibility.”

Yet as a tactic, it worked. Rape allegations judged strong enough to take to court by the Crown Prosecution Service were routinely lost. Brothers, cousins and men from the pub came to say they too had had sex with her. Jurors continually fell prey to the twin myths.

Campaigning for change in the late 90s, I wrote a pamphlet called Rape in Court and mentioned research by a Canadian academic who showed that the chances of a conviction in a rape trial were inversely proportional to the extent of sexual allegations made against a complainant. The more there was alleged, even if every bit of it was denied, the less the chance of a conviction. Add to that Lord Steyn’s view, and it is clear that many acquittals were gained by prejudice.

The clause utilised by lawyers for Evans was only added towards the end of the 1999 bill’s progress through parliament. It reversed the exclusion of sexual history evidence – if what the defendant alleged was sex between the complainant and another that was “so similar” to what was alleged in the rape that it could not be explained by coincidence. It has hardly ever been used.

The key case in which it was used concerned a couple having consensual sex, standing upright inside a children’s climbing frame. It was alleged that on a second such occasion, with the same partner, it was rape.

In Evans’ case, the court of appeal decided it “relevant and admissible” that the woman had had separate sexual encounters with two men, around the time of the alleged rape. On each occasion she had consumed a lot of alcohol, and had been enthusiastic, directing sexual events. She used similar words calling for more vigour from the male partner, and, once with each man, used a particular, though not uncommon, sexual position. Evans said she behaved similarly with him. Since this was presumably her typical conduct in consensual sex, it supported his case that she’d consented with him. But by any evaluation, these “similarities” are of a significantly lower scale than in the case of the climbing frame in terms of proving typical behaviour.

And therein lies the danger. Why wouldn’t most defendants, claiming consent, not check out the Evans defence? Why would they not seek to find out whether the woman has had sex with somebody else “similar” in style to that with the defendant? Evans had funding and private investigators. The current protections were not able to shield her and could be equally weak against a local search for witnesses and the do-it-yourself sleuthing that might be the poor man’s way. Consider the impact of such an intrusive investigation on the life of a complainant, and then her potential exposure to intimate questioning in court.

The potency of the “twin myths” is still well understood. One in five trials sees an application for sexual history to be heard, even now.

So is Evans’ case a rarity, or has the court, by lowering the bar of what is “admissible and relevant”, unintentionally lent itself to a potential return to the bad old days? If we are to not lose the recent upturn in rape reporting, and the slowly growing willingness of complainants to speak out, we must be vigilant. We fought to protect women from being unfairly judged on their sexual history. We may have to begin that fight again.

Lucasfilm, a subsidiary of Disney, is filing a lawsuit against a school that teaches students how to use lightsabers.

The company is suing Michael Brown, who runs a number of businesses, such as New York Jedi, but the documents target LightsaberAcademy.com, billed as “a consortium for academic, stage combat and sport dueling lightsaber instructors”.

“Defendants regularly use the Lucasfilm Trademarks without authorization in connection with their businesses,” the complaint reads. “Among other infringing activities, Defendants use a logo that is nearly identical, and confusingly similar, to Lucasfilm’s trademark Jedi Order logo … round in shape, with six wing-like shapes curving upward (three per side), and an eight-pointed star featuring elongated top and bottom points stretched into a vertical line.”

There have been a number of alleged cease-and-desist notices from Lucasfilm and Brown has reportedly responded with a trademark application for Lightsaber Academy, Inc.

“Lucasfilm has consistently denied Defendants’ requests,” it goes on to read. “Lucasfilm has never licensed or authorized Defendants to make any commercial use of the Lucasfilm Trademarks or any other of Lucasfilm’s intellectual properties.”

The suit demands that Brown pay the company damages and profits or potentially be required to pay $2m for every trademark infringed.

More than 700 British solicitors have applied to register with the Law Society of Ireland this year as lawyers scramble to secure professional rights of audience in European courts.

The precautionary investment, which cost each applicant about £300, is a way of guaranteeing access to the higher EU courts and tribunals in Luxembourg that deal with community law, which would be lost in the event of Brexit. Only lawyers from EU states can appear at the European court of justice.

Ken Murphy, the director general of the Law Society of Ireland, confirmed that 543 solicitors from England and Wales and 21 solicitors from Northern Ireland have been admitted to the roll of solicitors in Ireland so far this year. A further 145 applications are being processed. The figures compare with an average of 50 to 100 admissions a year from England and Wales in previous years.

“Of the EU member states, Ireland is the legal jurisdiction most equivalent to the UK,” said Murphy before the referendum. “We are both English-speaking, both common law jurisdictions and our legal institutions are much the same. This makes Ireland the destination of choice for solicitors in England, in particular, who are concerned about the possibility of the UK voting to leave the EU.”

“The right to argue before EU tribunals such as the court of justice of the European Union is only afforded to lawyers qualified in an EU state. It is our understanding that the majority of the solicitors who are completing this process will continue to practise in London or Brussels and do not intend to set up a physical practice in Ireland.”

Most of those applying this year from England and Wales cited Brexit as the reason for their registration.

Stephen Denyer, the director of strategic relationships at the Law Society of England and Wales, said: “It’s a long-established practice for English solicitors to qualify as Irish solicitors. It works in both directions. We fully understand why these solicitors would think it was a useful insurance policy. No one knows actually what Brexit is going to look like.”

Mickael Laurans, the head of the Law Society of England and Wales’s Brussels office, said: “A lot of people are applying. There’s a next step in order to practise but a lot of them are not going the full way and obtaining [an Irish] practising certificate. Maybe it’s an insurance policy.”

Eight men have been found guilty of sexually exploiting teenage girls in Rotherham.

The men, who include two brothers and four cousins, all raped or indecently assaulted the same girl when she was as young as 13, a jury at Sheffield crown court found on Monday. Some of them had abused two other girls as far back as 1999, the jury ruled.

The main complainant, who is now 27 and a campaigner against child sexual exploitation, said her abusers threatened to “gang-rape” her mother if she did not submit to their sexual abuse, which took place largely in an alley behind a branch of Boots in Rotherham town centre, in a local park and in bushes near a museum.

Her family were so afraid of her alleged abusers that they moved to Spain after their complaints to the police, social services, their MP and the home secretary went unresolved, the court heard.

The jury believed her when she said that Sageer Hussain, 30 – who is of British Pakistani origin, along with all but one of the other men in the dock – first raped her behind Boots when she was 13 and later called her a “white slag” when she tried and failed to stop him. She told police that the first and second time he raped her, between 1 January and 4 April 2003, he told her to scream so that his friends, waiting nearby, would know to come and watch. He was found guilty on Monday of four counts of rape and one of indecent assault.

His older brother, Basharat Hussain, 40, was found guilty of indecently assaulting her. Six further men, including two cousins of the Hussain brothers, were found guilty of abusing her or helping others to do so.

After the majority verdicts were returned in this trial on Monday, the National Crime Agency (NCA) said it was separately investigating more than 11,100 lines of inquiry relating to non-familial child sexual exploitation in Rotherham between 1997 and 2003.

So far 38 people have been designated “suspects” with many more under investigation, according to the NCA, which is carrying out the independent investigation at the request of the chief constable of South Yorkshire police.



NCA staff have been talking to 133 victims and survivors and have so far recorded 163 crimes in relation to their experiences. They have identified 17 distinct investigations under the overall inquiry.

To date, nine people have been arrested as part of the operation, codenamed Stovewood, with all suspects bailed until November and December, and one organised crime group has been mapped, identifying the nature and scale of its offending. Money laundering, other financial crime and drug-related offences have also been identified. 



The distinct investigations would be carried out by South Yorkshire police or other appropriate authorities to enable Stovewood to retain its focus on investigating child sexual exploitation and abuse, the NCA said.

The operation is recruiting additional officers to increase the size of the team to 117.

Stovewood’s senior investigating officer, Paul Williamson, said the operation was receiving good cooperation from South Yorkshire police, Rotherham council and health agencies “who have a vital long-term role in supporting victims and witnesses and providing information” to help the investigation.

“I am determined to identify and bring to justice all those who have abused children in Rotherham in the period covered by Operation Stovewood. The scale and complexity of the investigation is extremely large and it will take a number of years to complete.”

He said agencies were working together to identify any suspects who might still be active, and more arrests would be made this year.

The operation began after the publication in August 2014 of the Jay report, which said at least 1,400 children in Rotherham had been sexually exploited over a 16-year period from 1997.

The full verdicts returned by the jury on Monday were as follows:

Sageer Hussain, of Goole, was found guilty of four counts of rape and one of indecent assault. His brother Basharat Hussain was found guilty of indecent assault.

The brothers’ cousin, Mohammed Whied, 32, of Kimberworth was found guilty of aiding and abetting rape.

Ishtiaq Khaliq, 33, of Eastwood was found guilty of rape and three counts of indecent assault.

Waleed Ali, 34, of Rotherham was found guilty of rape and indecent assault.

Another of the Hussains’ cousins, Asif Ali, 30, of Rotherham, was found guilty of rape.

Masoued Malik, 32, of Rotherham, was found guilty of rape, false imprisonment and conspiracy to commit indecent assault.

Naeem Rafiq, 33, from Bradgate, was found guilty of conspiracy to commit indecent assault and false imprisonment.

They will be sentenced on 4 November at Sheffield crown court.

The Crown Prosecution Service praised the victims in the case for their bravery in coming forward.

Peter Mann, of CPS Yorkshire and Humberside, said: “In contrast to the courage and strength of the victims, these men’s actions are utterly abhorrent. They waged a campaign of sexual violence and intimidation against young girls in the Rotherham area 13 years ago.

“Their victims were targeted, sexualised, and in some cases subjected to degrading and violent acts. Sageer Hussain in particular took a leading role in befriending the young girls, and in the case of one victim, passed her on to his friends and other associates, assisted in various ways by the other defendants.”

Dr Alan Billings, the police and crime commissioner for South Yorkshire, said the convictions showed that authorities had changed the way they handled cases such as this.

He said: “South Yorkshire police is proving that it has learned from past mistakes and is determined to get right what it got so badly wrong before.

“The teams of specially-trained and dedicated officers work tirelessly to pursue and bring to justice those who exploit and abuse young people, which goes towards putting right some of the injustices and institutional failures of the past.”

He added: “This judgment sends a clear message to any others who think they can get away with treating girls and young women in this way, that this will not be tolerated and that the police and other authorities will ensure offenders are caught and brought to justice.”

Law students sometimes embark on their chosen course without knowing what exactly they’ve let themselves in for. High on enthusiasm, they arrive at uni harbouring fantasies about becoming the next Atticus Finch – but the truth is unlikely to be so grand. So let’s sort some of the facts from the fiction.

A law degree is often the initial step on the path to a legal career, introducing students to the core subjects. But it isn’t really essential for aspiring lawyers. Indeed the Supreme Court justice Lord Sumption advocates that law should be offered only as a second degree, as it is in the US. In a recent speech, he said studying law was “not a particularly good training for the handling of evidence, or for acute social observation, or for the exercise of analytical judgments about facts”.

For those set upon a legal career, he suggested, “the study of a different subject at a formative time of one’s life is personally enriching”.

So you may prefer to study a different subject, to add another string to your bow. If you take this route, however, you must also undertake the one-year graduate diploma in law (GDL).

Patrick Hulley, 21, a final year law student at Newcastle University, warns that the GDL is “more intense and stressful” than a law degree. And at a cost of £7,000 to £10,000, it will add to the already huge expense of legal training. Though there is one pay-off: the core subjects may be fresher in your mind when starting one of the professional courses (the BPTC or LPC).

Before starting his degree course, 38-year-old mature student Marc Tyler, now in his final year at Liverpool John Moores University, had assumed that studying law would require developing an encyclopaedic knowledge of English law, and memorising thousands of pieces of legislation and cases.

“I thought it would mean spending endless hours in the library searching for that one ‘killer’ case that would turn the world on its head, or at least get me top marks,” he says.

The reality, that 75% of his work is done away from the lecture hall or law library, was a “pleasant shock” for Tyler. “My romantic notion of nights spent looking through dusty tomes in the library were a little far-fetched, given that everything is online.”

Jade Foley, 19, a second-year law student at Brunel University and president of the university law society, agrees that this was the “biggest misconception”.

“We have eight hours of lectures and four hours of seminars a week. On top of that, I do up to four hours of study a day, which leaves plenty of time to socialise and get involved in extracurricular activities like mooting and debating,” she says.

The key, says Rhys Payne, a 25-year-old third-year student at the University of Law, who finds time for a job and a social life in addition to his studies, is to be organised and ensure you have balance.

The fact that most law firm partners and heads of chambers are men, and so are most of those holding senior judicial posts, gives a misleading impression of people seeking to enter the profession.

Patrick Hulley says he finds himself “in the minority” of law students at Newcastle University – and when on work experience most other students he meets are women.

Figures from the Law Society show that more than three-quarters of students accepted on university law degrees in 2014 were female.

Before he embarked on his studies, as a father of two (and later, three), Tyler was warned not to waste his money. He would not be able to do it with kids in tow.

He acknowledges that combining parenthood and legal study is no stroll in the park. “It involves long hours and juggling many balls,” he says, but it is made much easier by the fact that course materials are available electronically and much of the learning is “self-led”.

For students looking to become barristers or solicitors, the challenge of bagging a pupillage or training contract is increasingly tough. So perhaps it’s best to broaden your scope: law is an interesting and well-respected degree that could certainly help you get a job in another sector.

Students with law degrees are highly attractive to non-legal employers. A poll of 500 UK businesses by Marketing Minds showed that businesses value law graduates for their “transferable skills”, “aptitude for learning” and “strong leadership and communication abilities”.

Legal challengers attempting to give parliament the authority to trigger Brexit have a wider aim of trying to invalidate the referendum result, the attorney general, Jeremy Wright QC, has told the high court.

Opening the government’s response to the constitutional claim, Wright declared that the making and unmaking of international treaties was a recognised use of the royal prerogative – executive powers available to the government.

The legal dispute is over whether parliament or ministers have the authority to formally notify Brussels that Britain is withdrawing under article 50 of the treaty on European Union (TEU).

Article 50 states that any member state may leave “in accordance with its own constitutional requirements”, an undefined term that has allowed both sides to pursue rival interpretations.

Three of the most senior judges – the lord chief justice, Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd, the master of the rolls, Sir Terence Etherton, and Lord Justice Sales – are hearing the challenge, which could have far-reaching political and constitutional consequences.

The attorney general, who is leading the government’s legal team, told the court on Monday: “This is not a narrow legal challenge … It seeks to invalidate the decision already taken to withdraw from the EU.

“Making and unmaking treaties are an established use of royal prerogative powers. The use of prerogative powers [to trigger Brexit] was wholly within the expectation of parliament.

“The question is, has parliament acted to limit the availability of the royal prerogative powers? The answer, we say, is no.

“There’s nothing expressed in legislation that [shows] parliament has attempted to circumscribe the powers to make treaties. Parliament has conspicuously refused to legislate on withdrawing from the EU despite many opportunities if it had so wanted.”

Wright urged the court not to be distracted by the question of whether formal notification of the UK’s intention to leave under article 50 could be reversed once given.

“We do not argue that once article 50 [notification has been given] it can be revoked,” Wright said. “We ask the court to proceed on the basis that it’s irrevocable.

“[The government] is also content that, as a matter of firm policy, [that] notification of withdrawal will not in fact be withdrawn.”

Wright added: “The other parties in this case have sought to say they are defending the sovereignty of parliament. We say that parliament can retain its sovereignty as much by choosing not to do something as by doing something.

“It chose not to restrict the way royal prerogative powers work on multiple opportunities.

“The prerogative powers are available to use, we say, to give clear effect to the wishes of the people of the UK that we should begin the process of leaving the EU.”

James Eadie QC, who is also representing the government, said that giving notice under article 50 “would not have any immediate effect on UK law”.

Parliament would still be involved in the withdrawal process as it developed, he added. “The claimants have greatly exaggerated the impact on domestic rights that withdrawal from the EU will have.”

The case has profound constitutional and political implications, Eadie admitted. It tests the “flexibility” of the UK’s constitution. “We are dealing here with exceptional and probably unique circumstances. There’s no written constitutional formula.”

The consequence of the claimants’ case, Eadie asserted, was “to deny the constitutional flexibility which lies at the heart of our arrangement”. Parliament had, by design, left certain powers in the hands of the government.

But Etherton, the master of the rolls, asked whether the fact that parliament had not specified the precise limits of the royal prerogative meant that “the government can remove common law rights?”

And the lord chief justice enquired whether it was permissible to rely on the royal prerogative to withdraw from a treaty “even if it has effects on domestic law rights?”

This article was originally published on 27 September 2016.

Sir Cliff Richard will not be charged over allegations of historical sexual abuse after a challenge by two of his accusers over the decision not to prosecute was rejected.

The veteran singer was the subject of a long-running South Yorkshire police investigation, codenamed operation Kaddie, which centred on accusations dating from between 1958 and 1983 made by four men.

Officers investigating allegations of historical sex offences were filmed searching his Berkshire home in August 2014, leading to him being publicly named as the subject of the investigation. 



The 75-year-old was never arrested or charged and his case was discontinued by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in June on the grounds of insufficient evidence. Richard denies any wrongdoing.

Two of his accusers subsequently lodged applications under the victims’ right to review scheme, challenging the decision not to pursue the case, but the CPS said on Tuesday that its initial decision had been correct.

A CPS spokesman said: “On 16 June, the CPS announced that no criminal charges were to be brought as a result of operation Kaddie. The CPS subsequently received applications to review two of the charging decisions under the victims’ right to review scheme. In accordance with the scheme, a CPS lawyer who was not involved in the original decision-making process has completed a full review of the evidence and has concluded that the decisions not to charge were correct.”

The right to review scheme allows an alleged victim, within three months of the original decision, to call for it to be reviewed.

Following the announcement, Richard said: “As I have said previously, I’m innocent, so I’m obviously pleased with today’s CPS decision and the speed with which they reached it. I hope that it brings this matter to a close.”

When the investigation was brought to a close in June, Richard said he was “thrilled”.

“I have always maintained my innocence, cooperated fully with the investigation, and cannot understand why it has taken so long to get to this point,” he said. “Nevertheless, I am obviously thrilled that the vile accusations and the resulting investigation have finally been brought to a close.”

In July, Richard launched legal actions against the BBC and South Yorkshire police over the live broadcast of the raid on his house. While officers entered his Berkshire property, the BBC filmed from a helicopter hovering overhead. The singer was in Portugal at the time.

An independent police review in February 2015 sharply criticised an agreement made in 2014 between the force and the BBC, under which the broadcaster would delay reporting the allegations against Richard for one month in return for advance notification of the raid.

The parliamentary home affairs committee had already condemned the force’s handling of the case as “utterly inept”, but said the BBC was “within its rights to run the story”.

A young woman screamed in pain as she was caned in front of a jeering crowd in Aceh, Indonesia, the latest person to be punished after being found guilty of breaking the province’s strict Islamic laws.

Aceh is the only province in the world’s most populous Muslim-majority country that imposes sharia law. People face floggings for a range of offences – from gambling to drinking alcohol and gay sex.

The woman was among 13 people – seven men and six women aged between 21 and 30 – who were caned at a mosque in the provincial capital, Banda Aceh, as a baying crowd cheered the spectacle.

Six couples were found guilty of breaking Islamic laws on intimacy, such as touching, hugging and kissing, between unmarried people.



A man was caned for a less serious offence described as spending time with a member of the opposite sex in a hidden location in a fashion that could lead to adultery.

One 22-year-old woman was granted a temporary reprieve as she was pregnant. But Aceh’s deputy mayor, Zainal Arifin, said: “The punishment will be handed down after she gives birth.”

He added that he hoped the canings would serve as a deterrent: “We hope there are no more people in Banda Aceh who break the law in future.”

More and more people are being caned in Aceh. The number of women being flogged has particularly increased in recent times.

The province, on Sumatra island, began implementing sharia law after being granted special autonomy in 2001, an attempt by the government in Jakarta to quell a long-running separatist insurgency.

Islamic laws have been strengthened since Aceh struck a peace deal with Jakarta in 2005.

More than 90% of Indonesians describe themselves as Muslim, but the vast majority practise a moderate form of the faith.

British security agencies have secretly and unlawfully collected massive volumes of confidential personal data, including financial information, on citizens for more than a decade, senior judges have ruled.

The investigatory powers tribunal, which is the only court that hears complaints against MI5, MI6 and GCHQ, said the security services operated an illegal regime to collect vast amounts of communications data, tracking individual phone and web use and other confidential personal information, without adequate safeguards or supervision for 17 years.

Privacy campaigners described the ruling as “one of the most significant indictments of the secret use of the government’s mass surveillance powers” since Edward Snowden first began exposing the extent of British and American state digital surveillance of citizens in 2013.

The tribunal said the regime governing the collection of bulk communications data (BCD) – the who, where, when and what of personal phone and web communications – failed to comply with article 8 protecting the right to privacy of the European convention of human rights (ECHR) between 1998, when it started, and 4 November 2015, when it was made public.



It added that the retention of of bulk personal datasets (BPD) – which might include medical and tax records, individual biographical details, commercial and financial activities, communications and travel data – also failed to comply with article 8 for the decade it was in operation until it was publicly acknowledged in March 2015.

“The BPD regime failed to comply with the ECHR principles which we have above set out throughout the period prior to its avowal in March 2015. The BCD regime failed to comply with such principles in the period prior to its avowal in November 2015, and the institution of a more adequate system of supervision as at the same date,” the ruling concluded.

The ruling comes as the House of Lords is debating the final stages of the investigatory powers bill – the snooper’s charter – which will put the security services’ mass digital surveillance on a clear legal footing for the first time.

Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, said the ruling was “a sharp reminder” that the “draconian bill” – which Labour has abstained on so far – needed amending to ensure that surveillance powers should not be lightly handed over to the security services without greater accountability.

The investigatory powers bill will put mass digital surveillance activities on a clear legal footing for the first time since Snowden’s disclosure.

Chaired by Mr Justice Burton, the IPT ruling revealed that security agency staff had been sent internal warnings not to use the databases containing the vast collections of information to search for or access details “about other members of staff, neighbours, friends, acquaintances, family members and public figures”.

It also revealed concerns within the security agencies about the secretive nature of their bulk data collection activities.

In February 2010, a Mr Hannigan, then of the Cabinet Office, wrote: “It is difficult to assess the extent to which the public is aware of agencies’ holding and exploiting in-house personal bulk datasets, including data on individuals of no intelligence interest … Although existing legislation allows companies and UK government departments to share personal data with the agencies if necessary in the interests of national security, the extent to which this sharing takes place may not be evident to the public.” It is not clear from the ruling if this is Robert Hannigan, who went on to run surveillance agency GCHQ from 2014.



The campaign group Privacy International said the ruling showed that despite this warning internal oversight failed to prevent the highly sensitive databases being treated like Facebook to check on birthdays, and “very worryingly” on family members for “personal reasons”.

The IPT ruling included the disclosure from an unpublished 2010 MI5 policy statement that the BPDs included material on the nation’s personal financial activities. “The fact that the service holds bulk financial, albeit anonymised, data is assessed to be a high corporate risk, since there is no public expectation that the service will hold or have access to this data in bulk. Were it to become widely known that the service held this data, the media response would most likely be unfavourable and probably inaccurate,” it said.



The legal challenge centred on the acquisition, use, retention and disclosure by the security services of BCD under section 94 of the Telecommunications Act 1984 and the use of BPDs under a variety of legal powers. The tribunal noted the highly secretive nature of the communications data regime, saying “it seems difficult to conclude that the use of BCD was foreseeable by the public when it was not explained to parliament”.



Mark Scott, of Bhatt Murphy Solicitors, who was instructed by Privacy International in the legal challenge, said: “This judgment confirms that for over a decade UK security services unlawfully concealed both the extent of their surveillance capabilities and that innocent people across the country have been spied upon.”

Millie Graham Wood, legal officer at Privacy International, said: “[The ruling is] a long overdue indictment of UK surveillance agencies riding roughshod over our democracy and secretly spying on a massive scale.”

She said the use of BCD carried huge risks. “It facilitates the almost instantaneous cataloguing of entire populations’ personal data. It is unacceptable that it is only through litigation by a charity that we have learnt the extent of these powers and how they are used.

“The public and parliament deserve an explanation as to why everyone’s data was collected for over a decade without oversight in place and confirmation that unlawfully obtained personal data will be destroyed.”



Privacy International said the judgment did not specify whether the unlawfully obtained, sensitive personal data would be deleted.

A government spokesperson said the ruling showed that the regimes used to hold and collect data since March and November 2015 respectively were legal.

“The powers available to the security and intelligence agencies play a vital role in protecting the UK and its citizens. We are therefore pleased the tribunal has confirmed the current lawfulness of the existing bulk communications data and bulk personal dataset regimes.

“Through the investigatory powers bill, the government is committed to providing greater transparency and stronger safeguards for all of the bulk powers available to the agencies.”

Abbott said the disclosure of unlawful activity was shocking: “No one is above the law and the security services must be held to account on this. This scandal also has wider political implications,” she said adding that the bill places “far too much power in the hands of the police and politicians without judicial oversight and diminishes the rights of the citizens”.

“I myself have been a victim of unjustified surveillance over a number of years. To this day I have been given no indication as to whom approved this surveillance and why,” she said.

Workers on the minimum wage at an Argos warehouse have been offered an 80p an hour pre-Christmas bonus – but only if they don’t take time off sick.

In a move that one leading employment lawyer warned “would almost certainly amount to indirect disability discrimination”, temporary workers at the retailer’s Basildon depot have been told they will not receive an “uplift” if they call in ill once in any single week.

The workers at the depot in Essex were told about the new system in a note which began: “Great news starting this Sunday!”



It continued: “Agency colleagues will not lose the 80p uplift if they go home due to no work etc, but they will lose it if they go sick or don’t attend for work. If they go sick or don’t attend on one day, they lose their uplift for all of that week, but they then start fresh the next week with another opportunity to earn the uplift.”

One worker posted it on Facebook with the following judgment: “What utter rubbish.”



An Argos spokesman confirmed the note had been circulated to workers at the Basildon depot and said: “We do not tolerate discrimination and fully comply with the Disability Discrimination Act.”

But Michael Newman, a partner at the law firm Leigh Day, said if anyone with a chronic illness or disability that caused them to take sick days was not paid the extra 80p an hour, the employers could face a legal challenge.

“It is an apparently neutral measure that would impact workers with disabilities more than others, who may not be able to help regular absences,” he said. “[The employer] would have difficulties if they did not look at the individual circumstances of workers with disabilities to see whether they should get the uplift.

“If [they] wanted to not discriminate, they would have to review the circumstances of individuals who did not get the uplift, and ensure that the reason that they were not getting the payment was not their disability.”

The 80p an hour bonus applies to temporary agency workers employed for Argos by agencies across all its distribution centres.

Argos said: “As we prepare for our peak Christmas trading period it is a business priority to increase our temporary workforce to help meet higher demand and deliver an unbeatable customer experience.

“Additional resource is at a premium in the run-up to Christmas so to ensure we attract, retain and increase the attendance of our temporary workers, we offer an attendance bonus of 80p per hour, which applies to all agency staff across all of our distribution centres. We take the treatment of all staff – whether directly employed by us or indirectly via a third party agency – extremely seriously.”

Grindhouse actor Rose McGowan has said she was raped by an unnamed “studio head” and that a lawyer advised her she “would never win” a criminal case.

Tweeting under the hashtag #WhyWomenDontReport, McGowan started a series of posts suggesting that “because I’d done a sex scene in a film”, any prospective legal action would fail.

McGowan also wrote that her “ex” had “sold our movie to my rapist”.

McGowan has previously alluded to her sexual assault, suggesting in a 2015 interview with Buzzfeed that discussed the accusations of rape against Bill Cosby, that “it’s happened to me”. In September she also responded to Perez Hilton, writing: “I know what rape is.”

A ban on naming sexual crime suspects unless they are charged could be in place by the end of the year.

The former police officer Brian Paddick is leading proposals for a change in the law after the broadcaster Paul Gambaccini spent a year on bail accused of historical sexual offences before being told he would face no action.

Gambaccini and Sir Cliff Richard, who faced a televised police raid on his home before being informed there was insufficient evidence to proceed, were due to address MPs and peers about their ordeals on Monday.

Diana Brittan, the widow of the Conservative MP Leon Brittan who was investigated as part of a doomed Scotland Yard inquiry into claims of a Westminster paedophile ring, would also speak.

In March, she was told her late husband would have had no case to answer over the claims, and received an apology for the force’s failure to tell Brittan before he died that he would face no further action over a separate claim.

Paddick said: “Particularly in the wake of the Jimmy Savile revelations, most people are very well aware of the impact historical child abuse has had on the survivors of such offences, but the meeting is to give parliamentarians the opportunity to hear from those who have been affected by being falsely accused of such offences.

“No matter who they are – whether they are a local school teacher whose arrest makes it into the local newspaper, or whether it’s somebody like Cliff Richard, who has never been arrested but the allegations against him were all over the BBC and the national media – clearly it can have a devastating effect both on the individual’s reputation and potentially on their careers.

“The higher the public profile, the more devastating the impact can be because of the weight of publicity that is given to it.”

The proposal to amend the policing and crime bill would make it illegal for anyone to publicly name someone arrested on suspicion of a sexual crime unless they were charged.

But Richard Scorer, a specialist abuse lawyer at Slater and Gordon, the firm that represented victims including those of Rolf Harris and Max Clifford, said the publicity gave those targeted by abusers the confidence to come forward.

He said: “We have seen countless times how perpetrators isolate their victims, make them think no one will believe them and that it would be their word against the abuser’s. It is only following publicity around an arrest, and realising there were others, that some victims have felt able to come forward.

“Many dangerous offenders are only behind bars now because more victims came forward once the offender had been named following arrest. This strengthened the case significantly and resulted in conviction.

“It is a difficult balancing act because false allegations are damaging to those named, but they are rare and, on balance, justice is far better served under the current system.”

Police do not routinely name on arrest, but with Clifford and Harris the publicity after they were questioned led further victims to come forward.

Paddick maintains that more survivors are encouraged to come forward after a suspect has been charged and appeared in court, rather than on arrest.

The idea of a ban has been supported by the Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, who is Britain’s most senior police officer. The former chief constable of the British Transport police Andy Trotter was also backing the amendment, and would speak at the meeting on Monday.

Richard was the subject of a long-running South Yorkshire police investigation which centred on accusations dating between 1958 and 1983 made by four men. A police raid on his Berkshire home was televised and he is suing the BBC and the South Yorkshire force over the live coverage of the swoop.

The singer was never arrested, and earlier this year prosecutors announced that no charges were to be brought as a result of the inquiry. Last month, a review confirmed the decision was correct.

Gambaccini was kept on police bail for 12 months after being arrested on suspicion of historical sexual offences in 2013, before being told he would not be charged.

He described the Operation Yewtree investigation against him as a “witch hunt” that ate away at the idea of “innocent until proven guilty”.

The End Violence Against Women Coalition wrote an open letter to Richard, Gambaccini and Nigel Evans, the former House of Commons deputy speaker who was cleared by a jury of sexual offence allegations in 2014, urging them to abandon the campaign. 



The co-directors of the campaign, Sarah Green and Rachel Krys, said: “We want more discussion of rape and justice, not less. We want more openness and ever better practice by police and the courts in rape cases. We want the media to change the way it reports on rape. 



“We desperately need a huge increase in provision of specialist counselling and support services for survivors of sexual abuse. And in the long term, we don’t want anonymity for defendants because we don’t want it for those who allege rape either – because one day we will have eradicated the shame of being raped, and made this offence one which can be openly tested in court like all others.”

The government is to release new ratings for maternity wards across England to allow prospective parents to compare and contrast services in NHS hospitals, as part of a drive to reduce instances of stillbirth and brain injuries during labour.

Maternity data detailing the frequency of accidents within clinical commissioning groups and the health prospects of expectant mothers – including the percentage of smokers, for example – will be collated to form England-wide ratings.

In a major speech on Monday, Jeremy Hunt will also unveil proposals to allow the NHS to offer compensation automatically to parents of babies left stillborn or brain-damaged because of poor care. The health secretary wants parents of children starved of oxygen at birth no longer to endure a wait of about 11 years for compensation.

At present parents often become embroiled in lengthy and costly legal action against the NHS, forcing grieving families to fight for months or even years before the health service agrees to compensation.

Bereaved parents often have to instruct solicitors to determine the cause of their child’s death, with health bosses sometimes denying any liability until they are ordered to pay compensation by a judge.

Under the new scheme, which was first recommended by Tory peer Baroness Cumberlege earlier this year, an independent rapid resolution and redress scheme will be set up to investigate tragedies in childbirth, which would quickly decide whether compensation should be paid.

The launch comes as figures showed that the cost of settling claims with parents whose children are damaged at birth has reached more than £0.5bn. The NHS as a whole pays out more than £1bn a year in negligence compensation, and reducing that cost is seen a key way of mitigating the financial crisis facing the service.

In February this year, Cumberlege recommended the investigations into maternity cases and any subsequent payouts are made by the trusts without any court involvement. The recommendation was one of several made by Cumberlege, who has been chairing an independent review of maternity services in England.

The new proposals are modelled on a Swedish scheme, which has reduced serious avoidable birth injuries by about 50% in the past six to seven years.

Health secretary Jeremy Hunt said he hoped to end the culture where going to court was an automatic “first step” and instead foster a culture of transparency so the NHS can learn from its mistakes.

Under the plans, claims by parents who believe medical errors have caused severe damage to their children – such as cerebral palsy or brain damage – would be assessed by investigators working independently of the NHS trust. The investigators would quiz NHS staff and parents and look at medical records.



Their findings would be presented to a panel of legal and medical experts who would decide whether any compensation is warranted and arrange for payments to be made to the family.

The government hopes the scheme – which would assess about 500 cases a year – will help dismantle what it sees as a “litigation culture”. It would work out far cheaper for the NHS than the current route, in which cases go to court or are settled out of court, often for millions of pounds.

Data from the NHS Litigation Authority shows the compensation bill to the NHS for errors around the time of birth is rising, reaching £509.3m in 2015/16 – up from £393.2m in 2014/15.

A spokeswoman for the Department of Health said the plan, which will be the subject of a consultation, would not “lock” parents into the scheme and would let them bring their own legal case against the trust if they were unhappy with the outcome.

The new maternity ward ratings follow Hunt’s recent creation of similar schemes to help patients and families compare the quality of cancer and dementia care. However, once they start being published, they will set out details for services within each of the NHS’s 209 GP-led clinical commissioning groups rather than the 156 acute hospital trusts with maternity services. Hunt said that openness about the quality of care will help empower patients and reduce wide variation in care quality.

In a speech at the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, Hunt will also set out £8m for training, with at least £40,000 available to each NHS trust in England.

A £250,000 maternity safety innovation fund will pilot new ideas for improving care, while maternity ratings for every part of England – using data that already exists – will be published together to encourage greater transparency.

Other measures being unveiled include a new Healthcare Safety Investigation Branch, modelled on the Air Accidents Investigation Branch. A new tool will also standardise the investigation of every stillbirth and early baby death so lessons can be learned.

Hunt said: “Our NHS maternity staff do a fantastic job under huge pressure. But even though we have made much progress, our stillbirth rates are still among the highest in western Europe and many on the frontline say there is still too much of a blame culture when things go wrong – often caused by fear of litigation or worry about damage to reputation and careers.

“These comprehensive measures will give practical support to help trusts improve their approach to safety – and help to foster an open and transparent culture so that the courts become a last resort not an automatic first step.”

In May this year a new report revealed figures that 15 babies are dying every day in the UK from stillbirth, during labour or within four weeks of being born.

The report was published by MBRRACE-UK (Mothers and Babies: Reducing Risk through Audits and Confidential Enquiries in the UK), which is a collaboration of academics and medical experts.

It found that there were big variations in death rates across the country, from 4.1 to 7.1 per 1,000 births. Women from the poorest backgrounds and black and Asian mothers run a higher risk that their baby will die in the womb or soon after birth.

In nearly half of all stillbirths (46%), the causes of death are unknown, said the report. The biggest causes of death in the early weeks of life are complications following birth (32%) and congenital anomalies such as heart defects (28%), and very premature birth (13%).

The MBRRACE team flagged up the need for research into premature births and also called for every maternity unit to review and record the causes of death in the same way to try to discover why there are such stark variations around the country.

James Taylor, head of policy and public affairs at disability charity Scope, said of the new plans: “Finding out that your child has been affected by a birth injury can be a very traumatic time for parents.

“So it is very positive that the government will be listening to disabled people and their parents on how the NHS can better support families when serious issues do occur during birth.”

Global technology group Hewlett Packard’s newest cybersecurity employee spent the past two years grilling burgers at McDonald’s. Like many on the autism spectrum, the young man in his 20s possessed an impressive range of IT skills to match or even outshine most university graduates.

But unlike the average graduate, he didn’t have the social skills to make it past an interview. This is a common stumbling block for those on the spectrum, according to the psychologist Jay Hobbs from Specialisterne – a non-profit agency finding employment for people with autism.

“Being able to communicate and sell yourself was the barrier for him,” he says.

“But he was absolutely excellent. He’s one of those young men who is self-taught, so he was a very capable guy.”

An estimated 230,000 Australians live with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), which is defined as a developmental condition that affects the way a person relates to their environment and their interaction with other people.

The lifelong condition is well recognised and treated among children, but there is less support for adults with autism. Those on the spectrum describe meeting “the cliff” after secondary school – likening the sudden lack of assistance to falling off a cliff.

Recent research attests to the lack of support: the labour force participation rate is about 42%, compared with 53% labour force participation rate for people with disabilities and 83% for people without disabilities.

Jeanette Purkis, an author and advocate for the autism community, says many people on the spectrum struggle with job interviews as they often find the sensory experience and social interactions in an interview challenging. “Being in front of three people who are essentially deciding their future and firing questions they aren’t prepared for off at them is unlikely to enable an autistic person to demonstrate their skills,” she says.

“Autistic people often do much better in recruitment processes which enable them to demonstrate their skills over time and not in a high stress situation like an interview,” Purkis adds.

Hobbs says it’s an opportunity missed. “When I was working as a teacher in Queensland, I met some really interesting people who had some excellent skills, who in some cases after secondary schools just sat at home and wrote on blogs.

“They weren’t able to get opportunities to get a job largely because of the interview process. Someone with autism finds it a bit difficult to communicate and sell themselves as opposed to actually doing what the job would be – programming or testing software for example.”

Yet the tide is turning for unemployed or underemployed people with autism. More companies are ditching the stereotypes of Dustin Hoffman’s Rain Man and Sheldon Cooper from The Big Bang Theory, and realising the benefits of employing people on the autism spectrum.

Big names include mining company Weir Minerals, cloud computing firm Salesforce, Bankwest and Hewlett Packard. Software multinational SAP has even committed that people with ASD will account for 1% of its global workforce by 2020.

The director of human resources at SAP Australia and New Zealand, Lisa Christy, says the goal is consistent with the percentage of people on the spectrum in the general population.

“SAP believes that a cornerstone element of innovation is the diversity of those who participate in the creative process and the perspectives they bring to the table, including the perspective of those on the autism spectrum,” she says.

The effort to broaden the company’s diversity beyond race or gender started in 2012 when SAP Labs India hired five employees on the spectrum. Successful pilot projects in India and Ireland demonstrated the positive impact of empowering autistic people with a job that played to their strengths.

Research points to the clear corporate advantages of hiring autistic staff, including a surge in innovative and creative thinking.

A study by Curtin University’s school of public health found that the cost of employing an autistic person was comparative with the cost of employing a non-autistic person. The research involved almost 100 employees and 59 employers, who reported benefits from employing staff with ASD, including a high attention to detail and when compared with staff without ASD, a higher work ethic and quality of work.

Add to the momentum, comments by the PayPal founder, Peter Thiel, who has long been a proponent of hiring staff with autism and Asperger’s to avoid what he describes as “herd-like thinking and behaviour”. In his book Zero to One, Thiel says people with Asperger’s have a single-mindedness that gives startups a unique advantage.

This theory stems from the idea of neurodiversity, a term first coined by the Australian sociologist Judy Singer, who sees autism as a natural brain variation, not a brain disorder.

Dr Tele Tan is not surprised by the corporate world’s increasing interest in hiring autistic people. Tan, from Curtin’s autism academy for software quality assurance, oversees a weekend coding club for secondary students aged 12 to 16. The club, like others across Australia focusing on IT and robotics, is where autistic teenagers explore their technical talents while also picking up social skills.

Tan’s students typically have high attention to detail and an ability to concentrate on tasks and do repetitive tasks, making them ideal for companies searching for an innovative edge.

“There is anecdotal evidence that people on the spectrum have a huge innovation behind them – out of the box thinking, a non-traditional way of thinking,” he says. “They can potentially solve big problems.”

But autistic people aren’t limited to the IT industry. Specialisterne has recently launched the Autism and Agriculture employment scheme to develop career paths for those with autism in specialist animal care roles. The organisation is also taking aim at other industries, including art and engineering. It’s the start of a new frontier for people with autism.

Peer calls for reform after ‘soft justice’ outcry at sentence for Emily Maitlis’s stalker

Tesco workers are taking legal action against their employer on grounds of age and gender discrimination after the supermarket cut its pay rates for night and weekend shifts.

A group of 17 long-serving employees, who joined Tesco before 1999, are fighting the cut in wages introduced in July this year. Lawyers believe up to 38,000 staff who are paid by the hour could be affected.

Tesco announced the changes in February and they had been agreed in consultation with the shopworkers’ trade union, Usdaw, and staff representatives. The company said an accompanying 3.1% pay rise to £7.62 per hour made it one of the highest payers in the retail industry. But staff who used to receive double time for Sunday or bank holiday shifts saw their pay slashed to time and a half.

Leigh Day, the legal firm acting for the claimants, has written to Tesco asking them how many of Tesco’s staff who are paid by the hour – who are mostly over 40 years old – are affected. All staff taken on before 5 July 1999 have seen their benefits reduced.

Paula Lee, of Leigh Day’s employment and discrimination department, said: “The decision to impose pay cuts on long-serving employees is a bitter pill for our clients to swallow and we believe it is discriminatory. There seems to be a growing trend amongst retailers to cut staff wages and use those savings across other areas of the business.

“It is the longer-serving staff in these retail organisations who usually suffer. Understandably our clients feel their loyalty is being taken advantage of; that the employer knows they are unlikely to leave their jobs and, in turn, that makes them feel vulnerable to further ‘no choice’ pay cuts.”

A spokesperson for Tesco said: “Earlier this year we announced a pay increase of up to 3.1% for colleagues working in our stores across the UK, in addition to a 5% turnaround bonus. As part of the pay negotiations we also agreed to simplify premium payments to ensure a fair and consistent approach for all colleagues. The minority of colleagues who were negatively impacted by this change were supported with an agreed lump sum transition payment.”

The transition payment was equivalent to the loss in pay over the next 18 months. Tesco did not confirm how many workers were affected but said it was a small number.

A similar dispute is simmering at Marks & Spencer, which reduced the earnings of about 10% of its shop-floor workers by cutting premium payments for those working antisocial hours in July.

Leigh Day said it is also representing thousands of employees in discrimination claims against Asda and Sainsbury’s.

For the first time since Rolling Stone magazine published a shocking story about a brutal gang rape at the University of Virginia two years ago, the public may soon hear from the young woman at the center of the now discredited article.

A defamation trial against the magazine is set to begin on Monday over A Rape on Campus, the November 2014 article about a woman identified only as “Jackie” and her harrowing account of being gang-raped in a fraternity initiation. University administrator Nicole Eramo, who counseled Jackie and claims the story cast her, Eramo, as its “chief villain”, is seeking $7.85m.

Jackie was forced to answer questions about the case in April, but her comments have been kept under wraps. Eramo’s attorneys have said they intend to call Jackie as a witness at trial, although it is possible the jury will watch a video of her deposition instead of hearing from her in person. An attorney for Jackie declined to comment.

The story described in alarming detail Jackie’s account of being raped by seven men at the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity house in September 2012. Eramo’s attorneys claim the article portrayed her as indifferent to Jackie’s plight and only interested in protecting the university’s reputation.

After it was published, Eramo, who then served as associate dean of students, received hundreds of emails and letters calling her a “wretched rape apologist” and “disgusting, worthless piece of trash”. She still works for the university, now in a different administrative role.

An investigation by Charlottesville police found no evidence to back up Jackie’s claims and details in the lengthy narrative did not hold up under scrutiny by other media organizations. Rolling Stone officially retracted the story in April 2015.

Since then, three lawsuits have been filed against the magazine. A judge earlier this year threw out one case brought by three fraternity members, but a $25m lawsuit filed by the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity at UVA is scheduled to go to trial late next year.

Eramo’s trial will focus heavily on whether Rolling Stone editors and the article’s author, Sabrina Erdely, acted with “actual malice”, meaning that they knew what they were writing about Eramo was false or at least should have known it wasn’t true. US district judge Glen Conrad ruled in September that Eramo should be considered a public figure, which means she must prove actual malice in order to get certain monetary damages.

“A lot of this case is already decided,” said Lee Berlik, a Virginia libel attorney. “The big unknown really is how much damage did Ms Eramo suffer to her reputation, what is that worth, and I guess, most importantly, did Rolling Stone know what it was writing was untrue or should it have known?”

Eramo’s attorneys claim Erdely purposely avoided information she feared might ruin her preconceived narrative about how schools treat sexual violence victims while ignoring numerous red flags about Jackie’s credibility. Among other things, Jackie didn’t provide Erdely with the full names of the men she claimed attacked her and they were never interviewed for the story.

“Ms Eramo’s legal team is looking forward to presenting the overwhelming evidence showing that Sabrina Erdely and Rolling Stone knew that what they published about Ms Eramo was false and defamatory,” Libby Locke, an attorney for Eramo, said in an email. Locke said Eramo was not available for an interview.

Rolling Stone’s lawyers counter that Erdely had no reason not to trust Jackie, but stress that the young woman’s credibility isn’t the issue in the case. Rolling Stone attorneys argue in court documents that they still believe their reporting about Eramo and the university’s handling of sexual assault reports is “accurate and well substantiated”.

Rolling Stone points to a US Department of Education investigation that found last year that that UVA failed to promptly respond to some sexual assault complaints and created a “hostile environment” for victims.

“Dean Eramo’s lawyers are attempting to shift the focus of her lawsuit in the media to Rolling Stone’s reporting errors surrounding Jackie,” Rolling Stone spokeswoman Kathryn Brenner said in an email.

“The depiction of Dean Eramo in the article was balanced and described the challenges of her role. We now look forward to the jury’s decision in this case,” she said.

The jury is expected to view hundreds of pages of documents, including Erdely’s reporting notes, emails between Erdely and her sources and audio recordings of Erdely’s interviews with Jackie. The judge recently ruled that Eramo’s attorneys won’t be able to show the jury a video of Erdely’s deposition because they violated court rules by leaking it to ABC’s 20/20.

In giving the green light last month for the case to proceed to trial, Judge Conrad said he believed a jury could reasonably conclude based on the evidence presented thus far that the magazine acted out of actual malice. He noted that the evidence suggested that several people told Erdely her portrayal of Eramo wasn’t accurate and that Erdely had reasons to question Jackie’s credibility.

Among other things, the judge pointed to Erdely’s apparent disbelief when Jackie told her that two other women were gang raped at the same fraternity. Erdely told Jackie that was “shocking”, according to her reporting notes.

“I don’t know the stats on gang rape but I can’t imagine it’s all that common? So the idea that three women were gang raped at the same fraternity seems like too much of a coincidence,” Erdely wrote.

“It happens a lot more often than people might think,” Jackie replied.

Lenient sentences in cases involving stalking, terrorism and the sexual abuse of children could be challenged by victims under a law reform that is receiving cross-party support following a series of high-profile cases of so-called soft justice.

The courts’ treatment of a man who obsessively stalked the BBC Newsnight journalist Emily Maitlis for 25 years is one of the cases that inspired the proposed change. Other cases include the five-and-a-half-year sentence given last month to hate preacher Anjem Choudary, who could be out of prison within two years, despite courts hearing that he had encouraged at least 100 young people to turn to terrorism in Britain and Europe.

Judges in the court of appeal can increase sentences for a range of crimes, but this power does not apply to convictions involving stalking, coercive control, incitement to support a terrorist organisation or possession of indecent images of children.

Last month, “obsessed” stalker Edward Vines, 46, was jailed for three years after bombarding Maitlis with letters and emails. The pair had met in 1989 at Cambridge University, where they both studied.

Vines was found guilty at Oxford crown court of breaching a restraining order. However he had previous convictions, including for breaches of restraining orders in 2008, 2010, 2013, 2014 and also earlier this year, for which he was not given a custodial sentence. Before being sentenced at the beginning of September, Vines refused to commit to a pledge made earlier in the trial that, if convicted, he would never contact Maitlis and her family again. He told the court: “I will never contact them again if I’m defeated rationally in court – and I cannot say I have been today.”

The Plaid Cymru peer Lord Wigley is proposing an amendment to the policing and crime bill, due to be debated next month in the Lords, to increase the powers of the attorney general to refer such cases to the court of appeal. Wigley said: “The laws on leniency in sentencing need updating. There have been a number of disturbing instances recently of such leniency, but at the moment they are not offences that can be referred. The amendments would make that possible.”

It is understood the government has privately offered support to the change.

Harry Fletcher, director of Voice4Victims, who drafted the amendments, said that in cases of stalking, where the convicted person showed no remorse for their behaviour, it was crucial for the courts to keep them off the streets. “The law on the ability of the attorney general to refer such cases to the court of appeal needs urgent revision”, he said.

Claire Waxman, a mother of two who was aggressively harassed by a former classmate for more than a decade, was also involved in drafting the change as founder and director of Voice4Victims.

Her stalker, college acquaintance Elliot Fogel, 40, was prosecuted five times, jailed three times, and given a suspended sentence and a community order for his crimes in the past.

Yet it was only in April last year that Fogel, a former Sky Sports news producer, was sentenced to three-and-a-half years in prison after being found guilty of breaching a restraining order that banned him from ever contacting his victim.

Waxman said: “It takes a lot of courage for a victim to come forward and face the ordeal of the justice process. When an unduly lenient sentence is then passed and the victim cannot have their case referred to the attorney general, because the scheme is outdated, justice has failed.

“This is devastating for a victim, especially when all perpetrators have the right to appeal against their sentences, but it’s not the same from the victim’s side. This imbalance of rights must be addressed.”

Peer calls for reform after ‘soft justice’ outcry at sentence for Emily Maitlis’s stalker
###########################################################


Ched Evans has distanced himself from anyone who names the woman who accused him of rape, in a statement on his website.

The Wales international footballer was acquitted of rape on Friday following a five-year battle to clear his name.

In a posting on chedevans.com, he said: “Following yesterday’s decision at Cardiff crown court I want to stress that I absolutely disassociate myself from anyone who names on any forum the woman in this case. Or makes any offensive comments about her.

“Everyone associated with the past five years now has the right to move on with their lives and I wish no ill will to anybody.”

The post was published as a former solicitor general expressed concern about some of the evidence heard in the trial.

The government is to intervene to encourage companies to scrutinise their supply chains for evidence of worker exploitation or child labour, the international development minister will announce this coming week.

Detailing a £1m grant from the aid budget towards a campaign to lobby businesses to take more responsibility for the labour practices within their supply chains, international development secretary Priti Patel, said she wanted to clamp down on global child exploitation.

Patel is to sit as a member of the first-ever government taskforce on modern slavery, which will be chaired by the prime minister, Theresa May, who announced in July that this was a priority for her government. Reducing modern slavery within supply chains will be a core focus of that work, putting the onus on companies to clean up their act.

Before the national day against slavery on Tuesday, Patel outlined an increase in support for women and girl refugees in Jordan, Iraq and Lebanon, and for vulnerable people at risk of trafficking in north Africa and Europe.

“The international response to modern slavery, human trafficking and child exploitation has been far too slow,” she said, “which is why I am making eradicating these crimes a priority. As a member of the first government taskforce on modern slavery, I will … work with international governments, civil society, religious leaders and businesses to stamp out modern slavery and end all forms of violence, abuse and exploitation against children.

“As a globally engaged, outward-looking Britain we will keep our promises to the world’s poorest by protecting victims and ending these vile crimes for good.”

Child labour – both forced and not – involves close to 170 million children around the world, while 45 million people work in conditions of forced labour. Children are most commonly used in agriculture – the cotton, coffee and clothing industries are often pointed to as particular offenders – and in some of the poorer African countries, for example, up to 50% of under-14s will be in some kind of work, usually low-paid. But child labour it is not always a clear-cut issue – in some cases children may be working in order to attend school or help their family feed itself, while a study in the Netherlands suggested a third of Dutch 12-year-olds had a part-time job.

Patel said DfID will prioritise work with sectors including mining, tourism and agribusiness to improve transparency in labour practices and supply chains around the world as part of her new role as a founding board member of the Global Partnership to End Violence Against Children, a group lobbying governments, multilaterals, civil society, religious leaders and businesses to end all forms of abuse and exploitation of children.

The secretary of state’s focus on this agenda comes on the back of existing work which, DfID said, has already reached over 200,000 women in south Asia and the Middle East through the Work in Freedom programme, which trains women in their communities and works with businesses and recruiters to tackle trafficking.

Other grants being announced are £4mn for the Women and Girls Protection Fund for Europe and North Africa, which supports vulnerable groups at risk of trafficking or violence along migration routes, including by giving them access to legal and psychosocial services, and a £1mn extension to the UN Trust Fund to End Violence against Women, which will protect girls and women and support survivors of violence across seven key countries: Egypt, FYR Macedonia, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Serbia and Turkey. The focus will be on providing funding to smaller women’s rights and civil society organisations addressing the issue of sexual and gender-based violence experienced by women and girl refugees, said DfID.

Senior police officers, judges and prosecutors have been told by a former solicitor general to highlight the “exceptional” nature of the Ched Evans court case in an attempt to reassure women and encourage them to keep reporting rape.

The Wales international footballer, 27, was cleared on Friday of raping a 19-year-old woman after a retrial, following a decision to allow the jury to hear the woman’s sexual history.

The inclusion of evidence from the complainant’s previous sexual partners prompted anger from campaigners. The former solicitor general Vera Baird said: “I am hopeful that if enough of us say it’s an exceptional case then people will believe it.”

Baird, now the Northumbria police and crime commissioner, said the jury’s verdict to clear Evans threatened to shake women’s confidence in the justice system.

“We are just about getting more rape complaints coming through, which means people are having confidence in the police and in the courts,” she said. “This [verdict] is likely to deter people, but I am hopeful that in the longer term everyone will say, judges will say, the police will say, the crown prosecution will say: ‘That was an exceptional case, don’t hesitate and report [rape].’”

On Thursday it emerged that the number of rapes recorded by police has doubled in the past four years although the percentage of allegations resulting in conviction has fallen.

Data released on Saturday by HM Inspectorate of Constabulary on behalf of its rape monitoring group found that in 2015-16, police recorded 23,851 reports of adults being raped – nearly all of them women – compared with 10,160 in 2011-12.

Evans was found guilty of rape in 2012, a conviction quashed in April. The original conviction was then referred to the court of appeal after a 10-month investigation by the Criminal Cases Review Commission, which found new information not raised at the original trial.

The appeal court judgment allowed fresh evidence from two male witnesses who gave detailed testimony about the complainant’s sexual preferences and the language she used during sex, a decision that led to her being questioned in open court about intimate details of her sex life.

Defence lawyers have been banned since 1999 from cross-examining alleged rape victims in court about their sexual behaviour or history but the court of appeal said the specifics of the Evans case meant such evidence ought to be admitted.

Baird, who was instrumental in bringing about the change in law governing the admissibility of complainants’ sexual behaviour, said the Evans case raised questions over whether the relevant section in the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999 should be re-examined and possibly even more tightly regulated.

She said: “You could say, bearing in mind that these words seem to be capable of wide interpretation, that if the judge says you could use that section they should also tell the barrister: ‘You want to ask that? Well you’re not asking that. You want to ask that? Yes you can ask that’ – and limit them to that.

“It was a late addition to the legislation and the legislation itself was very well thought out with a long consultation but perhaps this late amendment was not and didn’t have as much discussion before it was passed so perhaps it was a bit less well thought through.”

Theresa May has rightly read the Brexit vote as a popular revolt against metropolitan trendies like David Cameron and Jeremy Corbyn and every other variant of the species. Given the chance to poke the whole pack of us in the eye, what with our “progressive” values and smug, big city ways, Leavers seized it with Faragist glee. The prime minister has taken their cue. Disastrous, disordered and unlovely it may be, but her Brexit stance has, at least for now, caught the mood and achieved the substantial feat of making the Labour leader and his coterie look even more clueless than they did already.

But May presumably also knows that the path she’s set could lead to economic calamity. For now, she can afford a bit of that: prosperous Outers may be ready to be a little worse off for a while in return for their hoped-for reassertion of their idea of their country’s true identity; the less prosperous who voted Leave, many of whom don’t normally vote at all, have low expectations about everything anyway. Even so, May won’t want to preside over too steep or too ugly a decline. With Keir Starmer on the case, even Her Majesty’s Opposition might help make something useful out of it. That is why May badly needs the very things the Brexit vibe she’s milking most reviles.

London, like it or not - and this is hardly ideal - is the key to UK financial health. Globalised, multicultured and full of immigrants, it powered through the last recession as the rest of proud Britannia flailed. At the last count, London was generating £364bn of the UK’s £1,590bn annual economic output – a massive 23% of it, with the surrounding south east of England contributing a further 15%.

Between 2010 and 2014, London’s economy grew by 6.8% compared with 4.4% for the UK as a whole. London’s workers’ output is 73% above the average. When Brexit darling Boris Johnson wrote three years ago that “we can no longer blame Brussels” for our problems and should look instead at our own “sloth” – especially when compared with “the Germans” – he might have named the labour force of the city he (loosely-speaking) led as mayor at the time as an exception.

Britons who fear and loathe London and all it symbolises in their eyes might note that taxes raised in the capital help fund their public transport, their affordable housing, their health services, their schools, their police officers and the upkeep of their public footpaths and parks. Almost one third of UK taxes are raised in London. A report compiled for Johnson found that the equivalent of £2,500 per Londoner subsides the rest of the UK every year.

So here’s an irony: even as the PM endorses the disruption of all that is integral to the nation’s capital – its international business links, its receptiveness to foreign incomers, its resulting cultural variety - she is to draw more deeply from its well of wealth. A revaluation of business rates looks set to increase London’s tax bill by an average of 11% - amounting to more than £700m - while in most of the rest of England rates will go down.

Johnson’s successor at City Hall, Sadiq Khan, has called this a “kick in the teeth” for the capital. The London Chamber of Commerce and Industry has warned of the dangers of London business being seen as a cash cow. The Institute for Fiscal Studies comments from a wider angle: “It will contribute to the ongoing trend of the UK government becoming more and more dependent on revenue from London to fund services across the whole”.

Here is the intensifying context for the continuing debates about giving London government and those of other big city regions greater autonomy. No one is demanding a bigger piece of the pie, just more control over the piece they have. Regional, rather than Whitehall, decisions about transport infrastructure, housing, schools and skills training should mean better results, with social and economic gains to follow.

Progress in that direction had already been made in the form of new, executive “metro” mayoralties for Greater Manchester, the Liverpool city region and the West Midlands. Inaugural elections will take place next year. The victors will be looking for more powers to be sent their way. In London, Khan is pressing for post-Brexit arrangements that will help the capital, which voted 60-40 to Remain, to maintain its status as a city that is “open for business”, including the creation of a London-only work visa.

Some of his critics, still truffling for imagined un-Britishness in the born-and-bred Tooting boy, imply that in so doing he seeks to subvert the national will. Well London, didn’t want what “Good old Boris” helped them get, and other big cities felt much the same way. They are the very parts of Britain the prime minister must help to better help themselves if Britain is to survive her Brexit strategy. She needs London. She’d be wise to give the capital what it needs too.

Young barristers are heavily in debt and becoming vulnerable to depression, the chair of the Bar Council’s youth wing warns.

In an address to the organisation’s annual conference on Saturday, Louisa Nye will say many find it “difficult to stop worrying” at a time when lawyers are characterised in the media as a “scourge on society”.

Young barristers start their careers with accumulated debts of up to £70,000, she will go on, at a time when many are earning the “lowest of sums” for important work that is undervalued by society.

Nye, who is chair of the young barristers’ committee of the Bar Council of England and Wales, will admit that she herself had suffered from anxiety and depression. 



“I have lost a close friend who took her own life, in part under the strain that this job and circumstances can place on people,” she will tell the conference.

“Today’s cohort of young barristers is in a particularly vulnerable position. They are financially vulnerable – as a consequence of tuition fees and increases in the [Bar Professional Training Course] fees, we now know that young barristers can have anywhere from £30,000-£70,000 debt when they start out in the profession.

“Many are making repayments over their first five years of practice, if not substantially longer. Young criminal and family barristers are receiving the lowest of sums for carrying out important work, and many are struggling to maintain a living.”

Nye, who is a member of Landmark Chambers in London, will add: “Parts of the media have reports almost daily where lawyers are criticised for the work they do and characterised as a scourge on society.

“Young barristers live in deeply uncertain and difficult times … And it is difficult against that background not to feel somewhat lost and somewhat depressed.”

She will point to the Wellbeing at the Bar report published last year which highlighted high levels of stress and anxiety felt by barristers.

Nye will say: “The survey found that one in three barristers finds it difficult to control or stop worrying. One in six barristers said that they felt low in spirits most of the time.”

It was once renowned as the home of the four great inventions: paper, gunpowder, printing and the compass. These days, China is more often portrayed as a land of copycats, where you can buy a pirated Superdry T-shirt or a HiPhone and where smaller cities boast 7-12 convenience stores, Teabucks outlets and KFG fried chicken shops.

Behind the startling brand infringement on display in markets and shopping streets lies a deeper intellectual property issue. Chinese entities have consistently sought to play catch-up by piggy-backing on other people’s technological advances. They have pursued software, industrial formulas and processes both through legitimate means – hiring in expertise, buying up startups, tracking publicly available information – and questionable or downright illegal ones: digging genetically modified seeds out of the fields of Iowa so they can be smuggled on a Beijing-bound flight, or paying for details of a specialised process for making a whitening pigment used in Oreos, cosmetics and paper – which sounds like a niche concern until you learn that the titanium dioxide market is worth $12bn a year.

The British carmaker Jaguar Land Rover is suing a Chinese firm for allegedly copying its Range Rover Evoque, in the latest of several motor industry cases. In the best known, China’s Chery reached an undisclosed settlement with General Motors over cars so similar that the doors were interchangeable. That case had one really striking feature: when GM approached Chinese manufacturers detailing the components they would need for the Matiz, they were told that Chery had already ordered identical parts.

This week came the curious case of Pelamis Wave Power, an innovative Scottish company which lost several laptops in a burglary after being visited by a 60-strong Chinese delegation – and then noticed the launch of a strikingly similar project in China a few years later. Chinese experts had certainly demonstrated a close interest in the work of Pelamis.

Whether engineers had been working along similar lines, were paying close attention to what Pelamis had made public, or somehow obtained information by other means is impossible to say.

What is certain – say western governments, business experts, analysts and security experts – is that Chinese businesses are routinely benefiting from the theft of intellectual property. Companies doing business in China are routinely advised to take clean laptops rather than their usual work devices on trips; to ensure that their work is protected with patents and trademarks internationally; and to be careful about the information they hand over to partners or potential manufacturers.

But their greatest vulnerability is operating in the age of the internet. In 2012, Keith Alexander, then director of the US National Security Agency, described commercially targeted cyber-attacks as “the greatest transfer of wealth in history”. The following year, a commission suggested such intrusions cost the US $300bn a year – with China responsible for up to 80%. They range from phishing expeditions to narrowly targeted approaches – and even attacks designed to find out what legal and other means firms are using to challenge earlier thefts.

China is consistent and angry in its denials of state-sanctioned industrial espionage: “The Chinese government does not engage in theft of commercial secrets in any form, nor does it encourage or support Chinese companies to engage in such practices in any way,” the president, Xi Jinping, said last year.

Chinese firms – even state-owned ones – are not always acting at the behest of officials, still less in the interests of China per se. But security experts have linked commercial incursions to People’s Liberation Army buildings and personnel and Nigel Inkster, formerly of MI6 and author of China’s Cyber Power, observes: “It’s safe to say that there’s been a general policy imperative to catch up with the west technologically, by whatever means.”

China is not unusual in this regard, and has been on the other end of the equation: in the 18th century, French manufacturers received an immeasurable boost when a Jesuit priest sent detailed information from its porcelain capital Jingdezhen. Doron Ben-Atar, a history professor at Fordham University and author of Trade Secrets: Intellectual Piracy and the origins of American Industrial Power, says the US and every major European state engaged in technology piracy and industrial espionage in the 18th and 19th century.

While the US was officially pioneering a new standard of intellectual property, “acts of intellectual piracy were often undertaken not only with the full knowledge but also the aggressive encouragement of officials from the federal and state governments”, he adds.

But not only are there now clear international agreements on intellectual property, there is also vastly more to steal, the internet makes it much easier to do so – and the speed with which breakthroughs are seized upon by others is increasing all the time.

The Chinese intellectual property regime has developed rapidly: Dr Xiaobai Shen, an expert on intellectual property and business at Edinburgh University, says courts could soon be overwhelmed by the number of domestic cases, and the blatant sale of counterfeit goods has been curbed somewhat. But foreign firms and governments still struggle to pursue cases. In the titanium dioxide case, an individual was jailed in the US – but prosecutors were unable to serve documents on the Chinese firm concerned.

That has prompted pushback at state level. In 2014, the US Justice Department announced it was charging five Chinese military officers with stealing trade secrets. Just over a year later, following the threat of sanctions, China signed landmark deals with the US and then the UK, agreeing not to conduct or support hacking and intellectual property theft for commercial gain; it was tacitly understood that old-school nation-state spying was still on the cards.

Those agreements were greeted with scepticism – but Dmitri Alperovitch of the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike says intrusions on commercial targets in the “Five Eyes” – the intelligence alliance made up of the US and UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand – have fallen by as much as 90%, with hackers apparently shifting to domestic targets and Russian entities.

“Prior to the agreement, we have seen pretty much every sector of the economy targeted: insurance, technology, finance. They have scaled back,” he says.

Inkster thinks that may mean a focus on different sources, such as human intelligence. The agreements are also ambiguous, because of the blurry line between commercial and national security interests when it comes to sectors such as food and energy – with China interpreting national security much more broadly than western nations do.

Prof Willy Shih, an expert on innovation at Harvard Business School, suggests that nations naturally shift focus as they develop. “Korea and Japan moved from the imitation phase to the innovation phase – and China will do that too,” he predicts. Some point to tech firms such as Xiaomi and WeChat as proof that era is fast arriving.

The more domestic technology China needs to protect, the greater its stake in international intellectual property standards – and, incidentally, the more brainpower can be diverted from unlocking other people’s trade secrets into developing its own.

Woman who accused the footballer of rape was repeatedly named online, leading to concerns the current law is inadequate
###########################################################
International footballer Ched Evans has been found not guilty of the rape of a 19-year-old woman, but the decision to allow the jury to hear the sexual history of the complainant has sparked outrage from women’s support groups and campaigners.

As Evans was acquitted of rape at a retrial on Friday, five years after having sex with the woman in a hotel room, activists expressed fear that an earlier appeal court ruling which allowed the complainant’s sexual behaviour to be taken into account by the jury would set a dangerous precedent, and could deter women from coming forward to report sexual offences.

The appeal court judgment – which was made before the retrial, but can only now be reported – allowed new evidence from two witnesses who gave testimony about the complainant’s sexual preferences and the language she used during sex. It led to her being questioned in detail in open court about intimate details of her sex life.

Evans, who has played for Wales and Sheffield United and was a member of the Manchester City youth setup, spent two and a half years in prison after being convicted in 2012 of raping the young woman following a drunken night out in his home town of Rhyl, north Wales.

Following his conviction, a well-funded legal and PR campaign that included the offer of a £50,000 reward for information leading to his acquittal was launched by family and friends. The campaign eventually resulted in the case going to the court of appeal in London, where his conviction was quashed.

After an eight-day trial, a jury at Cardiff crown court took two hours to acquit Evans. He kept his head down as the male foreman returned the unanimous verdict. Evans then rushed from the dock into the arms of his girlfriend, Natasha Massey. They held each other for a minute and sobbed on each other’s shoulders.

In a statement read outside the court by his solicitor, Shaun Draycott, Evans said he was “overwhelmed with relief”. He thanked his friends and family, “most notably my fiancee, Natasha, who chose, perhaps incredibly, to support me in my darkest hour”.

The statement concluded: “Whilst my innocence has now been established, I wish to make it clear that I wholeheartedly apologise to anyone who might have been affected by the events of the night in question.”

A spokesman for Evans said he would now return to football, although he is currently nursing an injury. He may be able to sue for lost earnings, which would come to millions of pounds. Chesterfield, his current club, welcomed the verdict. Chief executive Chris Turner said: “We can now all move forward and focus on football.”

It can now be revealed that:

The woman told the jury she woke up naked in a hotel room in Rhyl, north Wales, in May 2011 with no memory of what had happened but fearing that her drinks had been spiked. Friends encouraged her to go to the police, and officers found out that the room in which she woke up had been booked and paid for by Evans. He was questioned, and both he and his friend and fellow footballer Clayton McDonald said they had consensual sex with the woman.

The prosecution said she could not possibly have consented, as she was too intoxicated. She has never alleged that Evans or McDonald raped her.

In court, Evans admitted that he lied to get the key for the hotel room and did not speak to the woman before, during or after sex. He left via a fire exit. It also emerged that Evans’s younger brother and another man were trying to film what was happening from outside the room.

Lisa Longstaff, of the group Women against Rape, said the case seemed a “throwback to another time”. Section 41 of the Youth and Criminal Evidence Act 1999 puts restrictions on what evidence can be put before a court by the defence about an alleged victim’s sexual behaviour and questioning of the complainant.

“But it has exceptions, and clever lawyers can get round it,” said Longstaff. “Here they’ve driven a coach and horses through the supposed protection.”

Vera Baird, the barrister, women’s rights campaigner and police and crime commissioner, said the appeal court decision would “go down as a precedent that will be used and abused”. She said the exception used by Evans’s team was originally specifically about instances of sexual activity that happened “at or about the same time”, such as during sex parties.

One of the new witnesses said he had sex with the complainant on the same bank holiday weekend as the hotel incident; the second said they had sex a fortnight later. A feminist activist who goes by the pseudonym Jean Hatchet, and was behind petitions asking football clubs not to sign Evans following his jail term, told the Guardian it was “deeply worrying” that evidence about a victim’s sexual history had been permitted.

She said: “This will set a precedent in rape cases to follow where defence barristers will comb through an alleged victim’s sexual past and following the alleged assault at a time when they are suffering trauma.”

Rachel Krys, co-director of the End Violence Against Women Coalition, said: “We are very concerned at the precedent which might have been set. In addition to this, there are reports that the defence offered a ‘bounty’ for such testimony. This is extremely worrying. We will review the case in full and may contact the Crown Prosecution Service and the government about aspects of this case which raise concern.”

Polly Neate, chief executive of Women’s Aid, said: “There is a big risk that this case overall has a negative impact on reporting. Only this week CPS figures revealed a quarter of women are not pursuing cases. If you look at the surrounding maelstrom about this case, it’s easy to see why that is the case.

“A woman’s past sexual history bears no relevance on whether or not they have been a victim of rape. There is a need to challenge pervasive cultural assumptions that equate a woman’s former sexual history with her likelihood of being a victim of rape.”

Police reminded people that naming the complainant was a criminal offence. Supt Jo Williams, of north Wales police, said: “We are aware that once again the victim has been named on social media. An investigation is ongoing. People need to be aware that they could find themselves being arrested and prosecuted. This was done previously – people were prosecuted and heavily fined.”

War used to be described as the continuation of politics by other means. But decades of effort have ensured that some tactics are no longer just a brutal form of diplomacy, but are defined as crimes. In recent years, the noble goal to protect humanity has been hollowed out by the despicable attacks on hospitals and schools carried out with apparent impunity in the wars across the Middle East. This deliberate targeting has to stop. In Yemen more than 140 people attending a funeral in the country’s capital Sana’a were killed in an air strike by Saudi-led coalition forces prosecuting a bloody war against Iranian-backed Houthi rebels. Russia allies itself with a state that uses chemical weapons against its own civilians. Russian and Syrian warplanes above Aleppo appear to be intentionally targeting civilians. Below them, hospitals, UN aid convoys and schools are no longer safe.

This week the quarter of a million trapped and starving people in Aleppo were told by Syria’s president, Bashar al-Assad, backed by Moscow and Tehran, that he had to “keep cleaning this area and to push the terrorists to Turkey to go back to where they come from, or to kill them”. International diplomacy pays lip service to the idea that such actions are, if proven, war crimes. In meetings, the UN security council “strongly condemns” such violations of international humanitarian law. Yet four of its five permanent members support coalitions that attack hospitals in Syria, Yemen and Sudan.

On Saturday, Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, and the US secretary of state, John Kerry, will meet in the Swiss city of Lausanne to consider steps toward settling the Syrian conflict. There is little expectation that anything will come of it. Russia is keen to win the Syrian war for Mr Assad at any cost – sending signals to the region’s authoritarian regimes that it will fill the vacuum left by a weakened US. Egypt, which backed a Russian resolution in the security council that removed the demand for an end to air strikes on Aleppo, is apparently in talks to site an Russian airbase on its soil. The argument of power is winning over the power of argument.

Such actions undermine the spirit and break the letter of international law. Despite the concept of universal jurisdiction, western governments prefer realpolitik. In 2014 the Foreign Office granted temporary diplomatic immunity to Tzipi Livni, then Israel’s justice minister, to protect her against arrest for alleged war crimes. How can justice be seen to be blind when of the nine countries that the international criminal court has opened inquiries into, eight are in Africa? Little wonder African countries threaten to withdraw when they watch states in the Middle East commit crimes against humanity with impunity.

Yet the answer to this is not despair. It cannot be. The construction of international humanitarian law represented real progress for humanity and it must not be abandoned. The evidence of war crimes must still be gathered, and their victims remembered. The Commission for International Justice and Accountability has already begun collecting material on the Assad regime’s actions with a view to potential prosecutions. If, in the future, the politics of Russia or Syria change, perhaps the leaders of those nations, who have blood on their hands, could have their day in court. This might yet happen. It has already happened once, to Chile’s General Pinochet, who died under house arrest facing hundreds of charges of human rights abuse in 2004. This is a history lesson that Mr Putin and Mr Assad do not want to repeat but should be compelled to learn.

The west, too, faces a chance to demonstrate that it does respect the constraints of international law. Soon western-backed Iraqi forces will aim to retake Mosul, Islamic State’s last major stronghold in the country. The conduct of the battle will determine whether victory comes at an unacceptable humanitarian cost. The UN predicts that 1.2 million people could be displaced. Safe passage needs to be ensured to the refugee camps, set up by agencies like Save the Children, outside of the battlefield. The Iraqi army has already bombarded civilian areas – and their Shia militias need reining in. Although Iraq is responsible for a judicious application of force, it is backed by London and Washington. Earlier this month, the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, made the case for Britain’s “soft power” to defend values enshrined in the UN charter. Mosul offers a chance to turn words into action and show that there is a better way to win a modern war.

Thousands of women who work in Asda stores have won the right to lodge the UK’s largest private sector equal pay claim.

An employment tribunal ruled that the women, who work in roles across the shopfloor, can compare their jobs with those done for a higher wage in Asda’s warehouses, predominantly by men. 



If the women win, the retailer could be forced to adjust the pay of many of its 130,000 shopfloor staff, and make back payments to those involved in the case going back to 2002, at an estimated cost of up to £100m. 



Lawyers representing the shopfloor workers said the women typically earned between £1 and £3 an hour less than staff at Asda’s distribution centres.



The shopfloor workers say they are doing jobs of equal value, but are paid less because their work was historically perceived as “women’s work” and therefore thought to be worth less than men’s work. They claim that this historical discrimination has never been corrected by the firm.

The Walmart-owned retailer argued the roles could not be compared because they were carried out in different locations. However, the judgment, which followed a Manchester employment tribunal hearing in June, deemed that this was not the case, paving the way for an equal pay case in which judges will examine the value of the jobs being done.

About 9,500 past and current Asda workers from across the UK have signed up with the law firm Leigh Day, which will represent them in the pay claim next year. Lauren Lougheed, a lawyer at Leigh Day, said: “This is a dramatic victory for the workers we represent. Asda tried to argue that because the shops and distribution centres were in different locations, with different pay arrangements, that Asda could pay the men what they like.

“However, the employment tribunal found that Asda, the employer of both men and women, could have made sure that there was equal pay between men and women if they wanted to, but chose not to.”



In a statement, Asda disputed the claims being made against it. “We believe the demands of the jobs are very different and are considering our options for appeal,” the supermarket said. “At Asda, hourly paid colleagues doing the same job in the same location are paid the same. Men and women doing the same job in our retail stores are paid the same. Men and women doing the same job in our distribution centres are paid the same. Pay rates in stores differ from pay rates in distribution centres for legitimate reasons, including the different market rates for different jobs in different sectors.”

Asda stressed that the decision by the tribunal was on a preliminary issue. “The tribunal has yet to consider whether the jobs are of equal value in terms of their demands and, if some jobs are, only then will the tribunal move on to consider the reasons for the differentials, including the existence of different market rates in different industry sectors,” it said.

At the hearing in June, Asda argued that its distribution and retail sectors were “fundamentally different” and that they operated in different environments and required different skillsets. The judge heard witness statements from five workers with different roles on the shopfloor, including a personal shopper from the Brighton Marina store and a former checkout operator in Wirral.

Lougheed said the judgment would have implications for other supermarket equal pay claims, including those Leigh Day is bringing on behalf of about 400 Sainsbury’s workers.

Chris Cook, the head of the employment department at legal firm SA Law, said the decision was a major milestone but only the first step in a long process. “This isn’t an isolated case by any means,” he said. “We’ll no doubt see major retailers up and down the country facing similar claims around the disparity between the wages of their distribution staff and employees working away on the shopfloor. Even more crucially, employees in any number of sectors will be taking a closer look at their pay packets and how they compare to their colleagues across a business.”

One of the most extraordinary features of the Ched Evans case was the manner in which the complainant was abused on social media and her identity revealed.

By the time Evans was jailed in April 2012 she had been named thousands of times. The woman was forced to relocate from her hometown of Rhyl and change her identity but even during the retrial this month, she continued to be named and abused.

In November 2012 nine people pleaded guilty at Prestatyn magistrates court in north Wales to publishing material likely to lead members of the public to identify the complainant in a rape case, contrary to the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act, 1992.

Six were from north Wales, including Ched Evans’s cousin Gemma Thomas, three from Sheffield, where Evans played (for United). One tweeted: “She is to blame for her own downfall. Lets find her address.”

The nine claimed they were not aware naming the woman was a criminal offence and were ordered to pay £624 compensation each.

At a Welsh Women’s Aid violence against women conference, police said a “relocation package” was put together after the abuse she received.

The conference discussed whether the existing legislation aimed at preventing “conventional” media from divulging the complainant’s name was now out of date and was difficult to apply to social media.

Little appears to have changed. The naming and abuse continues.

After the jury had been sworn in for Evans’s retrial in Cardiff, the judge, Mrs Justice Nicola Davies, was furious that a blog had identified the complainant and made – in the words of the prosecution – “outrageous assertions” about the case. The prosecution called it a “flagrant” breach of the law and raised the possibility that the trial would have to be abandoned.

The blog was referred to the attorney general’s office. The solicitor general, Robert Buckland QC, has referred it to the police for a criminal investigation to take place.

But postings continued. An Ireland-based blogger, Ciaran J Goggins, was among those who carried on commenting on the case – and the complainant – during the trial.

Another social media storm is bound to follow the trial. Many will, no doubt, criticise Evans. But it is likely the most hostile messages will be aimed at the complainant. She has been warned by police to expect another onslaught.

Ever wondered what it was like to report a sexual assault in the latter half of the last century? There is no need to source a rare copy of Roger Graef’s searing documentary A Complaint of Rape, or to bother sifting through social history books, because the events in Cardiff crown court this month have been an unedifying window into the past.

The young female complainant was subjected to the kind of grilling about her sexual behaviour that was a throwback to 30 years ago.

The woman, whose name has been illegally and liberally spread over social media for years, said she was the victim of a man much more powerful than herself, professional footballer Ched Evans – a man who successfully overturned his conviction for rape following a protracted legal battle.

The footballer had been convicted of raping the woman in April 2012, on the grounds that the 19-year-old was so drunk she was incapable of consenting to sex. But in the retrial that ended on Friday, the jury concluded differently: Evans was found not guilty in a case in which consent remained the central issue.

Following his initial conviction four years ago, Evans has fought to prove he was wronged ever since. When he lost his appeal later that year, supporters of Evans, including his partner’s millionaire parents, hired private detectives, put up a £50,000 reward for information, and went to the Criminal Cases Review Commission – which for no publicly explained reason fast-tracked the case and brought it back to the court of appeal.

Here Evans’s lawyers produced two men – both known to the footballer’s circle – who said they had slept with the young woman in the weeks before and after the incident with him at the Premier Inn in Rhyl. They testified variously that she was sexually brazen, had demanded to be “fucked harder”, and assumed the same sexual position with them both.

These happened to be the same words and sexual positions that Evans had told police the woman had taken up during sex with him at a hotel room in the early hours of 30 May 2011. His account of what he said took place had been freely available on the internet – something the appeal court knew.

According to Vera Baird QC, in the past many defendants in rape trials called in their mates to testify to the woman’s promiscuity to undermine her credibility.

It was Baird who helped draft the restrictions intended to stop that abuse of the criminal process: section 41 of the 1999 Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act was introduced to combat the twin myths liberally smeared on female rape complainants in the criminal process, effectively putting the complainant on trial – the myths that promiscuous women are more likely to consent to sex and less worthy of being believed.

But the appeal court judges, exploiting the one exception in the legislation, said the accounts of sexual behaviour in the Evans case were so similar they could not reasonably be explained as coincidence. They quashed his conviction and ordered a retrial, and the evidence of the two men was heard in front of a jury for the first time.

So for the past fortnight, the young woman, who has had to move house because of the social media campaign against her, has been subjected to the kind of criminal dissection of her morality and sexual behaviour campaigners hoped were long gone.

Whether she said words to the effect of “fuck me harder” during sex with two other men was a key part of the trial.

The court heard two independent witnesses who testified the girl was very drunk, had glazed eyes and was incoherent and stumbling on the night she encountered Evans. The law states that in order to give consent a woman, or a man for that matter, must have freedom and capacity to consent. For those who are not clear, that means not being under the severe influence of alcohol. But the jury, having heard the evidence in court, clearly were not convinced.



Last year, the director of public prosecutions, Alison Saunders, decided to tackle the stubborn prevalence of the kind of rape myths that were around in the 1980s – myths that social media seems to have amplified.

“Capacity means that someone who is under severe influence of drink or drugs … or who is asleep, may not be able to consent to sex,” she wrote, adding, “Being drunk can make someone vulnerable, it doesn’t mean they were ‘up for it’.”

There has long been concern that lawyers have tried to undermine the protections given to rape complainants in section 41, including by slipping past sexual behaviour into evidence via medical reports.

Many fear the events in Cardiff crown court will mean more women are subjected to the kind of humiliating, intrusive and misogynistic dissection of their sexual behaviour that should have been consigned to history.

In April, almost five years after the footballer Ched Evans was first accused of raping a 19-year-old waitress in a hotel room, a 16-page judgment on his case was handed down in the appeal court.

It quashed his conviction and ordered a retrial – clearly a huge step for Evans, his complainant and all those around them. But following his acquittal in the retrial, the ramifications may go much further than that.

Women’s support groups and campaigners believe the appeal court’s judgment dangerously undermines the legislation designed to protect victims of sexual assault by restricting what courts can hear about a complainant’s sexual history and behaviour.

There is huge concern that the Evans retrial – during which the complainant was quizzed in detail and at length about whom she had had sex with, the positions she favoured and the language she used during it – may stop some women reporting rape and other offences for fear they will find themselves in the same situation.

The route to this appeal court decision was long, tortuous and controversial.

Evans’ friends and family bankrolled a high-profile campaign to try to prove his innocence. The Ched Evans website offered a £50,000 reward for information leading to the footballer’s acquittal, posted versions of that night’s events favourable to him, and made allegations against the waitress. In the first two years of its operation it received more than 2m hits.

At times the campaign sailed close to the wind. Evans’ fiancee, Natasha Massey, was accused by the prosecution during the retrial of trying to induce a key prosecution witness to change his evidence by flagging up the existence of the reward.

The wealth of Evans and Massey (she is a millionaire’s daughter) meant the Evans camp could assemble a team of PR people and top lawyers who succeeded in getting the accusations against Evans back before a fresh jury. Such resources would be available to very few convicted men.

At the heart of the successful appeal were fresh statements from two young men who described their sexual relations with the complainant, who was referred to in the crucial appeal court judgment as X, at around the time of the alleged rape in May 2011.

One, Y, actually came forward the day after Evans was found guilty in April 2012 to say she had had sex with him following the incident. He thought it “inconsistent” that she had slept with him a fortnight after she was attacked and – at a time when social media was alive with abuse about her – he came to the conclusion she was motivated by greed when she went to the police.

A man called Jack Higgins – who along with Evans’ younger brother Ryan voyeuristically peered in through the hotel window at the footballer and X – asked him to speak to Evans’ defence. He was briefly interviewed but his evidence was not used at that time.

In September 2015, the witness was re-interviewed by a private detective who was part of the new beefed-up Evans legal team. At this point he said X directed the sex and used the phrase: “Fuck me harder.” It was the first time he claimed she had used these words.

The explicit phrase is important because it chimes with what Evans claimed had happened in his encounter with X. He continues to insist she used exactly the same language.

A second man, Z, who was in a sexual relationship with X at the time of the alleged rape, had also made a rather bland statement back in September 2011.

In December 2015, he gave a much more detailed account to a member of Evans’ new legal team in which he said X had used the phrase “Go harder” with him.

Kieran Vaughan QC, for Evans, argued at the appeal court in the spring that there were “striking” similarities in the accounts of the two witnesses and that of Evans and they might support a defence of actual consent.

The law that Vaughan and Evans were up against as they tried to get the new testimony of the two men put before a new jury was the Youth and Criminal Evidence Act 1999.

Section 41 imposes stringent restrictions on what evidence can be put before a court by the defence about an alleged victim’s sexual behaviour and on the questioning of the complainant in court.

The provision was designed to counter the “twin myths” – that “unchaste” women are more likely to consent to intercourse and in any event are less worthy of belief.

However, the defence can get such testimony heard – and thus open the alleged victim up to potentially hugely intrusive and upsetting questioning – if the crucial issue is consent and the behaviour the witnesses claim is so similar to how a complainant is said to have acted during an alleged offence that it cannot reasonably be explained as coincidence.

As far back as 2002 Vera Baird QC pointed out the dangers of the exemption and called for an introduction of the Canadian law which states that a defendant must prove “reasonable steps to ascertain that the complainant was consenting”. She said: “That law focuses attention firmly on the events at the time, which must, logically, determine or, at the very least, dominate the defendant’s belief. What the man believed on the basis of rumours about the woman would, rightly, be pushed to the margins and would usually be completely excluded.”

As a result home office published research in 2006 which found that out of rape cases coming out of England and Wales in a three-month period in 2003, applications to introduce sexual history were made in a quarter of cases, two thirds of these were successful.

Eleanor Laws QC, for the crown, described what Evans’ team was trying to do as a “post-trial investigation into the sexual behaviour of a complainant”. She said it had the potential to undermine parliament’s attempt to abolish the “twin myths”.



Laws pointed out the sort of sexual activity the men described and the words the complainant was said to have used were commonplace.

During the appeal hearing, Laws claimed the delay in the men’s testimony bore all the hallmarks of witnesses being “fed” information by people close to Evans. In the retrial, prosecutor Simon Medland QC put to both of them that they had been motivated by the £50,000 reward. The allegations were strongly denied by Evans’ team and the men.

The vice-president of the court of appeal criminal division, Lady Justice Hallett, who heard the appeal with two other judges, said the evidence would be admissible only if the defence could “overcome the high hurdle of relevance and similarity”.



Hallett also said Laws was right to emphasise the importance of offering complainants in sexual offences protection from “intrusive and unnecessary questioning about their sexual history”.

However, she said with “a considerable degree of hesitation” the court had decided that the evidence of Y and Z could be admitted. She added: “This a rare case in which it will be appropriate to indulge in this kind of forensic examination of sexual behaviour with others.” Evans’ conviction was quashed and a retrial ordered.

During the retrial the jury was afforded glimpses into the Evans campaign – they knew there was a reward and heard something of how the two crucial witnesses’ evidence surfaced.

They were not allowed to hear about Massey’s approach to a vital prosecution witness, Gavin Burrough, who was on the hotel reception desk when the complainant arrived that night and who later said she was “out of it”.

The approach came in May 2013, soon after the reward was first offered. Massey sent Burrough a message via Facebook telling him she was at a “loose end”.

She wrote: “We are appealing for new information. There is a £50,000 reward for any new evidence. Do you know anything that could help Ched? He’s spent nearly 13 months locked up in prison for a crime that never happened. I’m pleading with you if you know anything.” She signed off with a kiss.

The next morning she contacted him again: “OK. I see you have chosen to ignore me. I understand you want to put it all behind you. If you can deal with the fact that Ched is innocent and he’s spending the next 17 months in prison and you can just sit back and let it happen so be it. I’m literally begging. If you know anything please help me x.”

In legal arguments at Cardiff, the prosecution argued that the messages should be put before the jury. Medland claimed Burrough was being asked to consider altering his testimony. He said: “There is no direct evidence it is a bribe but it is subtle and repeated inducement to change his evidence to support the case for the defendant.’’ Medland said the messages were “akin to a bribe” and had “the flavour of a bribe”.

The prosecution suggested the “inducement” demonstrated the “imbalance of power” between Evans and the complainant. He was a wealthy, professional footballer, she a 19-year-old waitress. Medland said it would be “artificial to imagine Evans was unaware of what was going on”.

Evans’ defence said he was in prison at the time and there was no evidence he knew anything of the messages or that they were sent at his behest. The trial judge, Mrs Justice Nicola Davies, allowed the existence of the reward to go before the jury but not Massey’s approach and rejected the claim it had the “flavour of a bribe”.

There is no suggestion that Evans’ team has done anything wrong. But there is a real concern that the appeal case and the retrial will stop abused women coming forward and will make it harder for prosecutors to get justice for victims of sexual offences.

Had it gone differently for Evans he may well have played alongside Gareth Bale during Wales’ wonderful run to the semi-finals of Euro 2016.

By the time the striker was arrested on suspicion of rape in 2011, aged 22, he had already been capped 13 times for his country – and scored on his debut. He was a hero at Sheffield United and a career at the top of the game beckoned.

Life was good. Evans earned thousands of pounds a week and had a steady girlfriend, Natasha Massey, the daughter of Cheshire millionaire and jewellery business owner Karl Massey.

But the prosecution at his retrial alleged that with Evans’ wealth and fame came a “sense of entitlement”. Following his arrest, he told police who interviewed him: “We could have had any girl we wanted ... We’re footballers. Footballers are rich and they have money. That is what girls like.”

On the night of the incident he was out in his hometown of Rhyl in north Wales with two footballers he had met while part of the Manchester City youth setup, Clayton McDonald and Javan Vidal.

After a few hours of drinking, it all went horribly wrong. Vidal was involved in an ugly incident outside a kebab shop in which he was headbutted by a 22-year-old woman whom he then knocked to the ground and kicked. He was to be handed a suspended jail sentence for affray.

Evans and McDonald ended up in the hotel room. A year later following his first trial in north Wales, Evans was beginning a five-year jail term for rape, his life and career in tatters.

McDonald, who was cleared of rape in 2012 at the same trial, and Vidal both still play football but for non-league clubs.

When released from prison after serving half his sentence, Evans continued to declare his innocence and was criticised for calling what had happened an “act of infidelity” against his girlfriend.

Petitions were launched when he tried to resume his career at Sheffield United and then at Oldham Athletic. Jessica Ennis-Hill said she would ask United to remove her name from a stand at the club’s ground if it offered Evans a new contract.

In July, Evans signed a one-year contract with League One side Chesterfield. He scored on his return to professional football in a 1-1 draw. His long-term future remains unclear.

The contrast between Evans and the complainant – the “imbalance of power” as it was termed by the prosecution – emerged clearly during the trial.

Evans was a rich, well-known footballer, a hero in his hometown of Rhyl. She was a 19-year-old waitress – three years younger than the sportsman.

She lived at home with her siblings. Her friends said at the time she was happy-go-lucky. She liked to go out and enjoyed a drink – she had two glasses of wine, four double vodka and lemonades and a shot of sambuca that night and, by her account, felt “a bit tipsy” rather than drunk.

Her mother, who has died since the incident, described her as “sensible”. When she did not return that night her mother assumed she had stayed over with friends.

Her reputation was torn to shreds following Evans’s charge and conviction. She was attacked as a “gold-digger” – though she has never actually claimed she had been raped. She said she woke up that morning not knowing she had had sex with anyone, let alone two footballers, until they confirmed to police this is what had happened.

The complainant was widely named on social network sites, which caused her to flee the area and live under a new identity. She continues to be named on social media and has twice had the trauma of giving evidence before crown court juries.

She did not seek the limelight. In a Facebook message to a friend shortly after the incident, she said: “I feel horrible ... I feel so embarrassed and shitty. I don’t even want people to know.”

She could make money now by selling her story. But through north Wales police she has made it clear she is “definitively adamant” that she will not talk to the media.

For university students around the country, freshers’ week has just come to a close. Traditionally associated with frenzied socialising and drinking, in recent years it has become notable for another fixture: sexual consent workshops. And this new term saw yet another protest led by a male student arguing that such classes were patronising and unnecessary.

These protesters couldn’t be more wrong. As a criminal law lecturer at Oxford and a campaigner who has facilitated consent workshops, I am disturbed by common and persistent misunderstandings of sexual consent. As a victim of rape myself, who shares my story openly, I have come to expect sceptical responses. If you heard my story, you might say, along with many others, “that’s just sex with regrets” but both legally and psychologically, you would be wrong.

So, during freshers’ week this year, I decided to challenge misconceptions of rape by staging a recreation of the immediate aftermath of my own violation, inviting people to come to see for themselves what rape looks like. In my story, would they be able to identify sexual violence, or would they just see an ordinary sexual interaction?

A better awareness of what constitutes rape is urgently needed. Figures published on Thursday show that the reporting of rapes in the UK has doubled over the past four years – which is thought to be an impact of high-profile cases such as Jimmy Savile – but also that the conviction rate has fallen in this time. Suggesting a reason for this, professor Liz Kelly of London Metropolitan University, commented: “There is a whole set of social assumptions about what a rape looks like, which most rapes don’t look like.”

My performance took place in student accommodation at the University of Oxford, just as my rape had done. Upon arrival, attendees were chaperoned into the building and invited to enter a bedroom. On entering the bedroom, the attendees found the curtains were drawn and the scene was lit by a single bedside lamp. In the bed I was lying on my side, in the arms of a male performer who held me against his body. This was the position I found myself in when I woke up that morning. I remember feeling confused and not knowing where I was, while also, disturbingly, enjoying being held. I was in shock.

Finding myself again in this position, five years later, I felt something quite different. As I recalled my rape, and experienced being viewed by others in a moment of such vulnerability, I cried and shook. I felt the shame that is so common among victims of sexual offences; the acute fear that those I was sharing this experience with would dismiss my story as many had done so before. I felt the gut-level pain of recognising what had been done to me. I lay in the bed for an hour and a half, as 20 students, some known to me and some strangers, came to view my rape scene.

My performance was inspired by the 1973 art work by Ana Mendieta, Untitled (Rape Scene), in which Mendieta reenacted the aftermath of a rape and murder that had occurred on her campus. The scene set was harrowing: Mendieta, nude from the waist down, bound to a kitchen table and smeared with blood.

While important in its time, I was troubled by the thought that this rape scene, like so many others portrayed in the media, was overtly violent. There is generally something shocking about those cases of rape we are exposed to, which signals to us that indeed this is an instance of sexual violence. For example, in the coverage of Brock Turner’s crime at Stanford University, much was made of the fact the sexual assault took place behind a dumpster, among dirt and pine-needles, with the victim being publicly exposed and suffering physical injuries. I couldn’t help but wonder if the case would have received the same coverage if Turner had taken his victim back to his accommodation, and assaulted her in his own bed, without inflicting physical injury.

After all, that is precisely what had happened to me. And, despite the law, which makes it clear that it is rape when someone has sex with a person who is incapacitated through intoxication, to many people my story was a bad one-night stand and therefore my fault. Even the police, when I first reported it, said that no crime had been committed. It was only when I complained they acknowledged I had reported a rape and offered to reopen the case.

Why the confusion? Perhaps, because what happened to me looks normal. There is nothing to shock or to excite, even to titillate. Those who attended my performance found a scene that was in many ways utterly mundane, having braced themselves for something visceral and confronting. That was the point. The very banality of my rape scene was meant to shock, and it did.

In a discussion after the performance, attendees expressed feeling acute discomfort upon viewing a normal private space, and realising that it could be the site of such violence. They were struck by how violence could take such a different form than that which they normally imagined. There was speculation that perhaps we don’t believe stories of rape of this sort, because we don’t want to believe people are capable of such things. But my performance made it impossible for attendees to disbelieve, forcing them to recognise that sexual interactions that are often dismissed as normal are too often instances of sexual violence.

These misconceptions about rape show why consent workshops in universities are crucial: to ensure that people really understand what sexual violence is. These workshops must continue. So too must journalism casting light on the realities of sexual violence on campuses, such as the recent Guardian coverage of sexual assault and harassment perpetrated by staff against students. I eagerly await the imminent Universities UK taskforce report examining violence against women on campuses and that its findings will make it clear that all universities must address sexual violence, in all forms.

As I hope my performance demonstrated vividly, we need to take sexual violence more seriously, including cases that do not look like those portrayed in sadistic crime dramas or reported in sensational news spreads.
