Data published on Thursday shows that 30% of applications are rejected, with many EU citizens unable to pass the paperwork test despite their legal right of residence as EU citizens.

If the government requires all non-Britons to join the non-EU immigrants in the permanent residency queue, up to 1 million could face deportation the day the UK leaves the EU. 



The Home Office said there had been “no change to the rights and status of EU nationals in the UK as a result of the referendum”. Its guidance was that EU citizens did not need to apply for permanent residence. “As such there is no requirement to register for documentation to confirm their status,” a spokesperson said.

A company that is implicated in an international bribery scandal has launched legal action against the Serious Fraud Office, alleging that the anti-corruption agency has unlawfully misused its powers.

The SFO is investigating Unaoil, a Monaco-based oil and gas firm, over allegations that it paid bribes to win contracts in several countries for dozens of multinationals, including the British engineering firm Rolls-Royce. According to the SFO, the alleged corruption is “very extensive”.

On Thursday, Unaoil opened its legal challenge in the high court in London, claiming that investigators working for the SFO unlawfully raided its headquarters in Monaco and seized a large cache of its documents, phones and computer equipment in a “cavalier” fashion. The firm alleges that the raid amounted to an “excessively wide fishing expedition rather than a proper exercise of” its legal powers.

Unaoil has denied all wrongdoing. In its submission to Lord Justice Gross and Mr Justice Nicol, Unaoil described how the SFO asked the police in Monaco to raid its HQ in March and used a truck to transport the seized material to the UK.

The raid was initiated after the SFO started investigating corruption allegations involving Unaoil, Rolls-Royce and an Australian multinational, according to Unaoil’s submission. The allegations related to transactions in Iraq dating back to 2005, the submission said.

Hugo Keith, a QC acting for Unaoil, alleged that the SFO’s request to the Monaco police to carry out the raid “lacked candour” and had misled them over the seriousness and urgency of the reasons for the raid.

Ata Ahsani, chairman of Unaoil, and his two sons, Cyrus and Saman, are seeking a court order quashing the legality of the raid, compelling the SFO to return the seized material and destroy any copies it holds.

A day after the raid in March, reporters at Australia’s Fairfax Media alleged – based on a leak of thousands of Unaoil’s documents – that the firm had systematically corrupted the global oil industry, distributing millions of dollars of bribes on behalf of Rolls-Royce and other multinationals which were seeking to secure contracts.

Rolls-Royce said it was fully co-operating with investigations into the allegations and could not comment in detail.

The SFO is opposing Unaoil’s legal challenge, maintaining that its actions were legal. In its defence, the SFO said it had “significant grounds to suspect” that Unaoil had “paid bribes and/or conspired together to pay bribes to high-ranking Iraqi and other public officials on behalf of” its clients.

The agency, which said its investigation was not limited to alleged bribery to Iraqi officials, added that Unaoil was “under investigation for the payment of a series of large bribes to government officials and officers of state in a number of countries in relation to the oil and gas sector”.

Jonathan Hall, the SFO’s QC, told the court that the agency “had reasonable grounds to suspect that Unaoil’s main activity is the paying of bribes on behalf of western oil infrastructure companies and the corrupting of tendering exercises to favour its clients”.

The SFO said it was concerned “that the effect of this flawed claim [by Unaoil] – whether that is its purpose or otherwise – will be to delay and disrupt an ongoing criminal investigation into serious fraud and corruption”.

Judgment will be given at a later date.

Life has not been easy for Paradise Sorouri. In the past seven years, the 27-year-old has been forced to flee her country twice, received more death threats than she can count, and was brutally beaten by 10 men on the street and left to die. Her crime? She covers her head with a baseball cap instead of a hijab, raises her voice for women’s rights, and is Afghanistan’s first female rapper.

In a country where, according to the UN, 87% of women have endured physical or sexual violence, Paradise’s scathing lyrics about gender inequality in post-Taliban Afghanistan have served as a spark for change and a lightning rod for controversy. She raps defiantly in Dari about how women can get acid poured on their faces for resisting rape, be married off as children to older men, and belong to husbands who can set them on fire.



“It doesn’t matter if you are a singer, an artist, or a teacher,” says Paradise. “If you are a woman in Afghanistan, you are a problem. I am speaking out and fighting for women who don’t have a voice.”

Speaking out has come at a price, but it has also garnered support. Paradise was recognised by the UN in 2013 for promoting human rights, while she and her fiance Diverse – together they are known as 143Band – won the Afghan ATN network’s award for best rap act in 2015. The duo are nominated again this year.

But as her popularity soared, so did the number of violent threats she received. Fearing for their safety, last year she and Diverse fled Afghanistan and joined the more than one million migrants who arrived in Germany from the Middle East. 



In the process, the pair have begun to reach an entirely new audience, writing and producing songs in their Berlin flat and touring throughout Germany. They release their first music video in two years next month for the song Bosaye Eshgh, they’ve just headlined at the international FeminEast festival in Stockholm, and Rebel Beats, a documentary about Paradise’s struggle as Afghanistan’s first female rapper, will appear in European film festivals early next year.

Born in Iran to Afghan parents who escaped the country’s civil war, Paradise moved back to Herat, Afghanistan’s third largest city, with her family following the fall of the Taliban. She grew up idolising Tupac, Eminem and Beyoncé though didn’t know anyone who shared her love of hip-hop until she met Diverse – another former refugee just back from Iran. The two decided to start making music together in 2008, but the odds were against them.

“Herat is a very religious city,” says Diverse. “Sharia law forbids women to sing. The fact that we are not married was also a problem. Every time we’d try to go to a studio together, strangers would start following us.”



One night, Paradise was walking home with her younger brother when 10 men on six motorcycles surrounded her and started beating her with wooden rods. “They were shouting at me and saying I was a bad influence on other women by trying to make music,” Paradise says. “All I could do was to try to defend my brother. They passed me from one man to the next. I begged people nearby to help, but they just urged the men to beat me to death.”

When Diverse found her, Paradise’s clothes were torn and she was covered in blood. He immediately took her to the police. “They told me I should stop singing,” says Paradise. “That’s when I knew that if I stayed silent, nothing would change.”

Fearful of what might happen if they stayed in Herat, the couple moved to neighbouring Tajikistan in late 2010, where Paradise began writing songs about women’s rights over Diverse’s beats. The following year, they released Faryad-e Zan (Woman’s Shout), the first song ever to feature a female Afghan rapper. In the years since, Paradise says she feels “proud and honoured” to have ushered in a handful of other female rappers, even if several have claimed to be the country’s first while simultaneously asking her for guidance.

During the next two years, the duo recorded nine more songs and shot five videos in the relative safety of Tajikistan. Then, in the summer of 2012, Paradise received horrific news: back in Herat, to avoid being married off to men in their 60s, her two young cousins – aged nine and 12 – had burned themselves alive.

Devastated, Paradise returned to Afghanistan and recorded a song in their memory called Nalestan. “I wanted to think and they hit me in the head,” she sang. “They burned my face in the name of Islam / And sold me because I’m only a woman.” The song won international attention, with 143Band named Afghanistan’s best rap artist at the 2014 Rumi world music awards.

“The success of Nalestan was both good and bad,” Paradise says. “We were interviewed by journalists from all over the world, but I started to get death threats every day. It got so bad I had to stay inside my sister’s house in Herat for a month like a prisoner.” Still, Paradise and Diverse were convinced their message of female empowerment would be more effective if they stayed in Afghanistan, so they relocated once more, this time to Kabul.

When Rebel Beats began filming in early 2015, a woman named Farkhunda – who was falsely accused of burning the Qur’an – had just been beaten to death and set alight by an angry mob in the street. The daily barrage of threats directed at Paradise had also reached a fever pitch and, throughout the film, she anxiously looks over her shoulder to see if she’s being watched.



At one point, the camera holds on a stony-faced Paradise as she reads message after message directed at her on 143Band’s Facebook page. Several men describe wanting to rape and behead her in front of Diverse. Another says he’ll throw acid on her if he ever sees her in person. The only time she breaks is when she’s asked about Farkhunda. “She has made me stronger,” Paradise says, fighting back the tears. “I will fight – not only for Farkhunda, but for all the Farkhundas.”

A month after the cameras stopped rolling, Paradise and Diverse left Afghanistan for good and began the arduous process of resettling in Berlin. Paradise is still fighting and is scheduled to speak at Talking Taboo, an international conference for women’s rights in London on 2 December.

“The people of Afghanistan still need our voice,” she says. “From here, we can make it louder.”

Extra legal powers may be needed to prosecute hate preachers who encourage violent radicalisation in private conversations, according to the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation.

In his final report after six years in the influential post, David Anderson QC says the requirement in the 2006 Terrorism Act that such persuasion needs to be “published” or delivered at a meeting should be re-examined.

“That change might make it possible to use undercover officers for the purposes of gathering evidence against those who are inspiring terrorists,” he suggests.

It may also be necessary to specify more clearly “examples of ways in which support for a proscribed organisation could be invited”, he explains. “Prosecutors with experience of such cases have told me that this could assist juries in matching the alleged conduct to the offence.”

Anderson, who stands down in February, was not formally recommending such changes but believed there should be a more detailed inquiry. “I offer them for discussion as a possible partial solution to the problems of prosecuting hate preachers,” he writes, “and in the spirit that our freedoms are better protected by a well-functioning criminal law than they are by a system based on coercive civil orders of broad and uncertain scope.”

Anderson says: “It is entirely fair to ask why the law did not catch up with Anjem Choudary [who was convicted of inviting support for Daesh earlier this year] sooner.” He said the Crown Prosecution Service considered Choudary’s activities on 10 occasions between 2002 and 2015.

In general conclusions, Anderson observes: “Laws against terrorism need to bear down hard on all kinds of extremists who espouse violence: but it is important also that they do not alienate the rest of the population.”

He welcomes the steady decline in the number of so-called port stops, used to question and detain travellers to determine whether they are involved in terrorism. They have fallen from 87,218 in 2009-10 to 28,083 last year.



“My overall impression is that though port controls remain a frequently mentioned irritant, the terrorism acts are no longer the focus for grievance that they once were,” Anderson notes. “Indeed they have been overtaken as a source of grievance by aspects of the Prevent strategy to counter extremism.”

The terrorism acts, he says, “are a broadly proportionate reaction to the current threat”. He states: “I reject the false narrative of power-hungry security services, police insensitivity to community concerns, and laws constantly being ratcheted up to new levels of oppression.”

However, Brexit could damage the UK’s ability to lead European policy and promote European laws in the counter-terrorism field, Anderson says.

He adds: “There are strong operational reasons for maintaining access to EU mechanisms that others may devise. Brexit will not alter the fact that as crime [including terrorist crime] crosses borders with increasing ease, the same must be true of the information and resources that are needed by those who fight it.”

In the report, written after the murder of the Labour MP Jo Cox by the Nazi sympathiser Thomas Mair, Anderson says: “The organised extreme rightwing threat in the UK is … perceived by the authorities to be fragmented, with no unifying ideology or set of principles. 



“In a document provided to me by the national counter-terrorism policing operations centre in July 2016, the threat of organised XRW groups was described as … ‘limited to low-level protest and heated online debate’.”

There were no deaths or injuries from terrorism in Britain during 2015, the report says, “unless one counts the injuries sustained by Lyle Zimmerman at Leytonstone tube station in London in December”. In Northern Ireland, there were three security-related deaths in the year to 31 March 2016.

The report adds: “Outside Northern Ireland, there have been only two deaths in the UK from terrorist incidents since 56 people [including four British suicide bombers] were killed in the 7/7 London attacks of 2005. The continuation of that record is impressive.”

The threat remains, however: “Some attackers or would-be attackers leave only a very limited intelligence trace, particularly if their radicalisation has been swift. 



“Others come to the attention of the authorities but are not given the priority that their subsequent actions show them to have merited, often for understandable reasons. And as was demonstrated recently in Nice, even such an everyday object as a large motor vehicle can exact a horrible toll on the innocent when used by a person heedless of the consequences for his own life.”

In his parting comments, Anderson observes: “Human rights do not hamper the fight against terrorism and extremism: they underline its legitimacy.”

Much has been written recently about the shocking conditions inside Britain’s jails. Suicides are occurring on average once every three days, and prison inspectors said this week that conditions in HMP Hindley are among the worst they have ever seen.

It’s about time that prisons stopped being holiday camps. Or at least that is what the Daily Mail would encourage you to think. If you ask the average person on the street why someone would end up in prison, you are likely to get some version of: “Because they have chosen to break the law and have harmed someone else.” And on prison’s purpose? “They should be harsh places of punishment to set an example and act as a deterrent.”

I work in the criminal justice system and have committed a large proportion of my life to trying to support offenders to turn their lives around. So you might expect me to argue against that statement, to try to blame the wider socio-economic picture and present a social justice argument about how we are all to blame for the crimes committed by these men and women.

However I completely agree that those who choose to commit crime should face incarceration. That prisons should be well run by the prison staff; who as society’s representatives in prison should be setting the agenda, holding firm boundaries and delivering society’s intention to both punish the offender and to minimise the chances of them choosing to break the law in the future. So on that level, I believe that the current situation in prisons is a travesty. Prisons are chronically understaffed and the inmates have far more power than ever before.

Contraband is commonplace. Where there is contraband, there is trade and where there is trade, there are people who control that trade who have status and power that they will seek to maintain. We have allowed a situation to develop where prison becomes an environment where the very traits and tendencies that we would hope prison would diminish are in fact reinforced, as legitimate strategies for survival and for status.

Staff shortages are now so acute that in many prisons, prisoners are spending 23 hours a day locked up – denied access to education and training, exercise and other activity proved to decrease the likelihood to reoffending.

So even from that paradigm, of prisons being for people who have chosen to break the law, the situation in prisons is unacceptable.

However in our experience of working with young men involved in the criminal justice system, the percentage of those who consciously chose to break the law or harm another is small.

The others fall into two camps. The first are those who see the supply of drugs to the marketplace as a victimless activity and the best means of making a living they have available, as an unskilled young male with no qualifications. The second group are those so lacking in maturity that they end up committing crimes, not through an active, conscious choice but a failure of impulse control in the moment.

It is easy to judge both of those groups and to believe them to be as deserving of punishment. I know I did. Before I had exposure to the reality of the lives they lived, I held strong views, typical of the middle-class culture in which I grew up. I judged drug dealers as preying on the weak in our society and was simply afraid of those who were so volatile and unpredictable. I wanted them taken away.

I am now rather embarrassed to have held those views. Over the past decade working with offenders, I have had a number of realisations. The first is that young men do not fully mature psychologically until they are in their mid-20s – something that can be backed up by research and evidence. I now count myself as fortunate that my middle-class circumstances as a young man meant that my own behaviour through a lack of maturity did not bring me into contact with the criminal justice system.

The second realisation builds on that theme of “there but for the winds of fate go I”. I have heard some truly heart-breaking stories of neglect and abuse. I have worked with young men who have been victims of sexual abuse, who as small children witnessed terrible domestic violence in the home, even watching their mother being raped. I have had to ask myself whether if I’d had similar experiences, I would be where I am today. The answer is a resounding no. Emerging neuroscience supports this conclusion, especially for males.

The tragedy is that putting these vulnerable young men into a toxic prison environment is likely to decrease their chances of building a successful life for themselves. Being exposed to further trauma, living in a dangerous environment (resulting in an almost constantly adrenalised state), where drugs are freely available and where positive role models are in short supply, are possibly the worst conditions in which to try to effect positive change. Is it any surprise that suicides happen so frequently?

Things were bad enough. The advent of “spice” and other synthetic cannabis substances creates a huge additional challenge in the prison environment. An odourless drug that is difficult to detect and can cause psychosis – especially in people who have experienced early-years trauma. Prison staff and others in the system have described it as a game-changer.

We the taxpayers are currently spending around £35,000 per prisoner per year to provide places in these institutions that on almost every level are failing. In 1993, the prison population was 44,000. It’s now 80,000.

The current system needs a radical rethink and a more nuanced approach to understand the reasons for offending and providing a sentence that is appropriate and has a chance of success. Until we start thinking in these terms and talking about “sentencing reform”, rather than simply “prison reform”, we are likely to retain a system that costs huge amounts of money, the lives of vulnerable people and the loss of human potential.

A judge who asked a complainant in a sexual assault trial why she couldn’t just keep her knees together should be removed from the bench, an inquiry tasked with probing the matter has concluded.



In a unanimous recommendation released on Wednesday, the five-person inquiry committee of the Canadian Judicial Council said Robin Camp “committed misconduct” while presiding over a 2014 trial into allegations of sexual assault.

The judge’s conduct, the committee said in its report, “was so manifestly and profoundly destructive of the concept of the impartiality, integrity and independence of the judicial role that public confidence is sufficiently undermined to render the judge incapable of executing the judicial office”.

The Calgary trial made headlines around the world after it emerged that Camp had repeatedly asked the 19-year-old complainant why she hadn’t done more to prevent the alleged rape. “Why couldn’t you just keep your knees together?” Camp asked her. Later he told her that “sex and pain sometimes go together”.

Throughout the trial, Camp erroneously referred to her as “the accused”. At one point he asked the complainant – who said the alleged assault took place on a bathroom sink – why she hadn’t sunk her “bottom down into the basin so he couldn’t penetrate you”.

Camp went on to acquit the man accused in the case. The Alberta court of appeal later ordered a new trial.

In September, an inquiry began looking into whether Camp – a provincial judge who had been recently promoted to the Federal court – should be removed from the bench.

The inquiry heard a remorseful Camp apologise for his remarks. “I was not the good judge I thought I was,” said the 64-year-old. Camp, who was born in South Africa and moved to Calgary in 1998, said he had not understood the changes made to Canadian laws aimed at sheltering sexual assault complainants from discriminatory attitudes.

The inquiry also heard from the female complainant, who said Camp’s remarks had left her grappling with suicidal thoughts. “What did he get from asking that?” she asked. “He made me hate myself and he made me feel like I should have done something … that I was some kind of slut.”

On Wednesday, the inquiry committee said Camp’s questions showed “an antipathy towards laws designed to protect vulnerable witnesses, promote equality and bring integrity to sexual assault trials.” The judge, they added, also relied on “discredited myths and stereotypes about women and victim-blaming during the trial and in his reasons for judgment.”

The recommendation will now be considered by the Canadian Judicial Council. Camp will be invited to make written submissions before the council issues a formal recommendation on his fate to Canada’s justice minister.

A tough alternative to prison, possibly involving “visible” work punishments in the community, should be more readily available to judges, the lord chief justice has suggested.



Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd has called for a debate on how to develop more challenging sentences that would allow offenders to be kept out of jail.

“The most difficult decision a judge ever has to make is whether someone should be sent to prison or not,” the lord chief justice said at his annual press conference in the Royal Courts of Justice on Wednesday. 



“If you are sending someone to prison for a very short time, the ability of the prison to cope with that person is limited in the current circumstances. It’s very important that you have real alternatives to prison. It’s important you have tough community sentences available … and this is something at which we really need to look.

“Should you have some really tough kind of work for [offenders] to do? Should you make the punishment visible? What’s essential is that you have a tough alternative to prison … These are things on which it would be good to have a proper open debate.” 



Fifteen years ago there was a low level of confidence in the probation service, Thomas said. That had now improved but there was still a need for better communication.

“Every judge should go to prison once a year,” Thomas said. “You need to know where you are sending people … The judiciary needs to have confidence and the press needs to see what is being done to rehabilitate or punish people.” 



There are already provisions for offenders carrying out unpaid work such as removing graffiti, clearing wasteland and decorating public places to be required to wear a high-visibility orange vest, however they are not widely used.



In 2008, Labour introduced vests with the words “community payback” written on the back for criminals on community service, a move that attracted controversy and criticism.

Thomas’s comments come as jails in England and Wales endure a turbulent period. This month thousands of prison officers staged a walkout amid claims the system was “in meltdown” after a rise in violence and self-harm. There are more than 85,000 people in prison in England and Wales.

Asked about the large number of prisoners still being held in jail under indefinite sentences for the protection of the public (IPPs) and who have served far longer than their original tariff, Thomas acknowledged that it was “a problem and I’m very glad to see the numbers coming down.”

This month Michael Gove, the former justice secretary, warned that too many people were being sent to prison.

A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: “Protecting the public will always be our top priority. Our message is simple: if you commit a serious offence, you should expect to go to prison.

“Sentencing is a matter for independent judges, and the sentencing council recently published new guidelines to make sure sentences accurately reflect the seriousness of the crime.”

Last year 8,600 probation staff were outsourced as part of the privatisation of more than half of the probation service in England and Wales.

In 2014, seven-year-long contracts for rehabilitation services worth £3.7bn were awarded to companies such as Staffline, Sodexo and MTCnovo to supervise low and medium-risk offenders. Those who are deemed high-risk are still supervised by the National Probation Service.

Theresa May should unilaterally pass legislation to secure the rights of up to 3 million European Union citizens to stay in Britain or risk souring the tone of the Brexit talks, according to Labour’s Keir Starmer.

The shadow Brexit secretary said May should act immediately and abandon her increasingly controversial position of refusing to make any concession over the rights of EU citizens in the UK without securing equivalent guarantees for the 1.2 million UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU.

“It’s becoming increasingly apparent to me from my discussions in Brussels with those that are likely to be involved in the negotiations that they are very concerned about the fact that we are not giving comfort and status to their citizens,” he told the Guardian.



“They have said to me, pretty well in terms, the UK should sort this out before March, and that would ensure that the article 50 negotiations got off to a much better start than they will otherwise do.”

Relations between the UK and the rest of the EU have become increasingly heated on the topic. On Tuesday the European council president, Donald Tusk, published a strongly worded letter to a group of Conservative MPs saying the issue would have to wait for formal negotiations to begin and appeared to blame the British electorate for causing the uncertainty in the first place.

Starmer described Tusk’s letter as unhelpful, but said it “points to the need to act unilaterally now, and is further evidence of the unhelpful atmosphere that has been created in the lead-up to the negotiations”.



In his letter Tusk added: “The only way to dispel the fears and doubts of all citizens concerned is the quickest possible start of the negotiations based on article 50 of the treaty.”

But Starmer, the MP for Holborn and St Pancras in London, said the government should take more urgent action as a goodwill gesture before formal talks begin. “Everywhere you go there is a mounting sense of very real injustice. I think everybody feels it; it’s across parties, and it can’t be left unresolved any longer.”

At prime minister’s questions on Wednesday, May defended her approach. She said: “I think the reaction that we have seen shows it was absolutely right for us not to do what the Labour party wanted us to do, which was simply to give away the guarantee for rights of EU citizens here in the UK. As we have seen, that would have left UK citizens in Europe high and dry.”



The government has suggested the vast majority of those EU citizens already living in the UK are likely to be entitled to apply for permanent residence, because they have been here for more than five years. But Starmer said that could be a bureaucratic and unwieldy process and could overwhelm the resources of the Home Office. He added that “permanent residence” was an EU concept, which would be expected to fall away when Britain leaves.

Instead, he suggested the government could “pass a domestic law, dealing with the status of these individuals, and it would get cross-party support, and could be passed very swiftly”.

He added: “At the very least there ought to be clarity for those who were already here on 23 June.”

The bad blood between London and Brussels over the future of EU citizens was indicative of a wider problem with the tone the government had adopted as it approached the coming negotiations, Starmer claimed, warning about “mixed messages” from London.

He contrasted May’s Conservative party conference speech, widely interpreted as signalling she favoured hard Brexit, with reassurances subsequently given to Nissan about continued access to the single market.

“It’s very difficult to suggest that what [May] said at conference and the Nissan assurance are the same thing, and so mixed messages are being received in Brussels. That is not healthy.”

He added that the sometimes jocular tone of the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, risked offending his EU counterparts. “They perceive an arrogance on behalf of the UK, and Boris Johnson may think he’s very amusing in his approach, but my perception is our EU partners are not in the mood for that kind of amusement.” He added: “We need to make sure that the tone is right.”

With just four months to go until May’s self-imposed end-of-March deadline for triggering article 50, Starmer said he believed there was still a tussle within the government about what kind of relationship with the EU it wanted to aim at when negotiations began.

“I think they haven’t come to a final view, and that is because the argument about Europe that has been going on for years in the Tory party has broken out like never before,” he said. “It’s become an argument about the very future of our country.”



Labour’s own stance on Brexit has sometimes appeared less than unanimous, and senior party figures have told the Guardian that Starmer himself – one of the highest profile promotions when Jeremy Corbyn refilled his frontbench after the summer leadership challenge – is being “man marked”.

He underlined Corbyn’s insistence that the party would not seek to block the triggering of article 50 – but did not rule out amending any legislation the government brings to parliament, to force May to reveal more about her negotiating stance.

“We won’t frustrate the process, but we do want to put some grip and grit into the process, to ensure that parliament and the public know the prime minister’s starting position,” he said. Asked if that could mean Labour tabling amendments to any bill, he said: “So long as it doesn’t frustrate the process, then it is important to look at options.”

Asked whether Brexit presented “enormous opportunities”, as the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, recently said, Starmer replied: “I think there are huge risks in Brexit; and I see the task of the Labour party as being to ensure that we get the best possible outcome that works for everybody in the UK.”

He also struck a somewhat different tone from the shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, on how Labour should tackle voters’ concerns about immigration.



Starmer crisscrossed the country earlier this year as shadow immigration minister – a job Abbott has not taken on herself alongside the home affairs brief.

Abbott used a recent interview to insist that Labour must champion the benefits of immigration, or risk becoming “Ukip-lite”.

Starmer said it was right to praise the contribution of migrants to Britain’s economy and society. But he said hundreds of conversations across the north-east, north-west, east and Wales had convinced him that “Labour needs to have a better answer for those that are concerned about immigration”.

“I don’t think we can hide from that, and don’t think frankly it was just the referendum. I think this has been a growing issue for five or 10 years, and it’s an issue on which Labour needs to get on the front foot, and off the back foot, and that means we have got to listen to what people are telling us are their concerns.”

Abbott and the shadow business secretary, Clive Lewis, have suggested that boosting trade union rights to enhance workers’ bargaining power and prevent wages being undercut could help allay voters’ concerns.

But Starmer insisted the party should also develop new policies on integrating different ethnic groups – an issue likely to be tackled in a forthcoming review by Louise Casey.

“There is a big labour market element to it of course,” Starmer said, but he added: “I do think there is a wider piece about how our communities live together, and we ensure that integration works in a way that benefits everybody, and by that I mean as much those arriving as those who are already here.

“That’s a debate that Labour have not engaged in at all really over recent years. And we shouldn’t be scared of this territory. In a sense, we don’t want to hear what people are saying to us; we just sort of move the conversation on. And my concern is Labour are not seen to be listening on this, and we need to be.”

Four Metropolitan police officers who say they were “branded abusive thugs” after the arrest of terror suspect Babar Ahmad 13 years ago have won the right to seek damages in the high court.

After a long legal battle, the court of appeal ruled the four could bring an action for compensation against the Met commissioner for “letting them down badly” by failing to robustly defend them over Ahmad’s claim that they had beaten him up.

The Met agreed in March 2009 to pay £60,000 damages to Ahmad after an admission that officers subjected him to a “serious, gratuitous and prolonged” attack.

Ahmad said he was punched, kicked and throttled during his arrest by officers from the Met’s territorial support group in December 2003.

The Met initially denied the claims, saying officers used reasonable force.

But lawyers for the force’s then commissioner, Sir Paul Stephenson, admitted at the high court that Ahmad had been the victim of gratuitous and sustained violence at his home in Tooting, south-west London.

The four officers – Pc Rod James-Bowen, Pc Nigel Cowley, Pc Mark Jones and DC John Donohue – were charged with various criminal offences. After a five-week hearing at Southwark crown court in 2011, the jury acquitted them of all charges.

The officers launched their own damages action against the Met commissioner.



A high court judge struck down their case in its entirety, but three appeal judges ruled on Wednesday that the four were entitled to bring their claim “for economic and reputational harm based on a breach of a duty of care at common law”.

The latest attempt by tobacco companies to prevent the introduction of mandatory plain packaging of cigarettes in the UK has been rejected by the court of appeal.

The judgment is a fresh blow to companies who face having to replace their current heavily branded distinctive packs with boxes that are indistinguishable from each other bar the brand name on the packet in standard typeface, colour and size.

The regulations aim to reduce the appeal and uptake of smoking, by children and young people in particular, help smokers to quit, prevent misleading packaging, and give greater prominence to health warnings.



But British American, Imperial, Japan International and Philip Morris claim that the move would infringe their human and intellectual property rights.



In May, the high court rejected their arguments, the day before the tobacco products directive of the EU took effect. Some of the companies took the case to the court of appeal last month but, on Wednesday, the three judges, sitting at the Royal Courts of Justice in central London, dismissed the challenge.

Lord Justice Lewison, Lord Justice Beatson and Sir Stephen Richards ruled that the health secretary had “lawfully exercised his powers”.

The companies now have the option of appealing to the supreme court.



Nicola Blackwood, the public health and innovation minister, said: “Standardised packaging will help cut smoking rates and reduce suffering, disease and loss of life. We are pleased that this decision will help many people to lead longer and healthier lives.”

Since May, legal challenge notwithstanding, companies have been forbidden from making packets that do not comply with the directive. However, they are allowed to sell off existing cigarette stocks until May next year, which means plain packets will only emerge in the shops gradually. 



The new packs will be the same shape, size and colour (green) and 65% of the front and back surfaces will be covered by picture health warnings, with written warnings on the sides.

Deborah Arnott, the chief executive of the health charity Ash, said: “This is a victory for public health and another crushing defeat for the tobacco industry. This ruling should also encourage other countries to press ahead with standardised packaging, now that the industry’s arguments have yet again been shown to be without foundation.”

Simon Clark, the director of the smokers’ group Forest, said: “By stigmatising the product, the government is also targeting the user. Plain packs are unlikely to deter people from smoking but the impact on consumer choice could be significant because some brands will almost certainly disappear from the market.

“Tobacco is a legal product. The law should not impose excessive regulations on consumers who know the health risks and don’t need this type of finger-wagging measure.”

The Forest website says Forest is supported by British American Tobacco, Imperial Tobacco Limited and Gallaher Limited, a member of the Japan Tobacco group of companies.

I serve on the independent monitoring board at Bedford jail where prisoners rioted this month. For the past eight years I have visited the prison about once a week. Every prison in England and Wales has an IMB of ordinary citizens, appointed by the justice secretary in much the same way as are magistrates. Their voluntary job is to monitor whether prisons do what they say on the tin – provide a safe and secure environment within which to help prisoners lead law-abiding and useful lives in custody and after they are released. Members visit their prison unaccompanied and unannounced, and have unfettered access to it.

In August, the IMB was so concerned for the safety of prisoners and staff that it took the unprecedented step of writing to the prisons minister, Sam Gyimah, asking for his urgent help.

HMP Bedford is a small, busy jail that holds about 500 prisoners, both remanded from the courts in neighbouring towns and others whose sentence plans are still being worked out prior to their dispersal elsewhere. It is located in the town centre, with excellent communications for staff and prisoners’ families, a location that allows, in principle, for extensive partnerships and engagements with local communities. But the antiquated buildings and facilities are desperately in need of renovation to make them fit-for-purpose (typically two grown men living, sleeping, eating and relieving themselves in cells built ungenerously in 1850 for one man, now with an unscreened WC and basin in place of two tin buckets).

The IMB’s last two annual reports – to the end of June 2015 and June 2016 – warned that the jail was in need of infrastructural investment, overcrowded by as much as 50%, and perilously under-staffed.

Within prisons drugs, violence and merciless bullying are endemic. The mix is toxic and threatening, a damaging punishment over and above the deprivation of liberty, autonomy and contact with your roots. Surely no judge intended such suffering when passing sentence?

Some lessons were learned a decade before I started visiting prisons: individuals need to be treated with decency, both because they are individual human beings and because rehabilitative efforts were shown to be futile in the absence of respect. Prisons can furthermore only be run economically by consent – an implicit pact between prisoners and staff, which depends upon the prisoners perceiving the prison management’s use of authority as having legitimacy. Decency thus has a crucial central place, in lock-step with rehabilitation, in securing cost-effectiveness.

The decency agenda has raised standards, but it requires continual attention which it has been often impossible to sustain in recent years as ”‘austerity” has swept through the prison estate. A series of savings-driven restructuring programmes have lowered salaries, changed terms of employment, drastically reduced staffing levels and deskilled officers. Capital and maintenance budgets have been slashed. Governors’ autonomy has been progressively eroded, not least by a long series of expensive and quite possibly ill-judged outsourcing contracts. The impacts have been devastating, and form the backdrop to the riots at HMP Bedford.

For prisons to deliver rehabilitation, on top of secure containment, there needs to be: a decent, structured, calm and uncrowded environment; sufficient numbers of committed staff who have the skill to go way beyond the (already very difficult) running of a safe jail, by working individually with every prisoner; ample opportunities for prisoners to use their time constructively (remedial and more ambitious education, training, work); and consistently superlative leadership and dedication to purpose throughout the system. By August this year, the cost-cutting programmes of the last few years had bitten hard into HMP Bedford. Many experienced staff members had left the service for better-respected and remunerated employment, necessitating the deployment of inexperienced officers. Recruitment and retention difficulties, (uncompetitive salaries set against the difficulty of the job) and long-term sickness were so serious that it was no longer possible to deliver the full range of required out-of-cell activities (opportunites to socialise with other prisoners, shower, make telephone calls, exercise, education, work etc) safely.

Opportunities for prisoners to be involved in any constructive employment were already drastically reduced and were fast vanishing. Instead, prisoners locked in their cells – often for up to 23 hours a day. These unplanned and unannounced “bang-ups” unsettled the prisoners as well as reinforcing their boredom. Staff shortages and rotations had become so severe that officers had insufficient time even to get to know the prisoners in their charge, let alone attend to their needs. The use of drugs had spiralled, and with that trade, the bullying of the weak and vulnerable. The incidence of self-harm and of violent assaults, both prisoner-on-prisoner and prisoner-on-staff, was rising alarmingly.

There was increasing rumour of prisoner unrest. The IMB was hearing accounts from officers that they were becoming afraid to work on the prison’s largest wing. The IMB letter to the minister warned that staff shortages were “beyond crisis point” and of the “alarming rise in prisoners attempting to hang themselves”. In the 10 weeks between the posting of the letter and the minister’s response, two prisoners were found hanged.

Gyimah’s reply, dated 27 October, however, was written very much in the register adopted for the minister’s acknowledgement of the IMB’s annual report. It gave airy explanations of how the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) agency, the National Offender Management Service (Noms), and the senior prison officers were coping with the IMB’s concerns, while conveying nothing more urgent in intention than a pat on the head. In effect, he was saying: “This is a prison! If you can’t stand the heat, keep out of the kitchen. Sorry to hear that it has made you anxious.” Less than two weeks later, on Sunday 6 November, the prison erupted in a widely reported riot involving more than 200 men from two wings. The incident of “concerted indiscipline” stopped short of catastrophe because: the officers on duty read the seriousness of the situation in time to withdraw, by degrees, and deprive the rioters both of hostages and keys; because of the sang-froid of the governor, as she took charge of the incident in the “command suite”; and because the prisoners were intent more on making a protest than on blood. This last may be a surprise to many, but I believe it to have been the case. Two residential wings and the central office and observation area were comprehensively trashed, nonetheless.

Surveying the devastation a couple of days later, an IMB colleague and I were approached by two experienced officers, who were plainly deeply affected by the riot. They wanted us to see the graffiti – versions of “If you treat us like animals, we will eventually behave like animals”, which implied that, at that moment, the prisoners and officers saw the prison in the same light. These officers were acutely aware that the extreme working environment they had experienced for months was paralleled by the stress they had imposed on the desperate prisoners. Behind their emotion lay the cataclysmic loss of trust. When this collapses, then all that you have worked to achieve seems to have failed. The officers were devastated.

The prisoners involved in the riot have been sent, in small batches, to prisons across the country. When they return, as many surely will (they are essentially local men) after the wings have been refurbished and the staffing problems have been resolved, I expect to hear similar deeply felt stories of betrayed trust from them, because there is never only one side to a story.

The inner turmoil experienced by the staff members on duty at the time of the riot has been debilitating. They had to take the awful decision to withdraw, abandoning the prison and vulnerable prisoners. The senior management team are racked with guilt that things came to this pass under their command.

Many rioters will only have participated for fear of violent reprisals if they abstained, creating fear at the time and complicated long-term consequences for them in the future. Even the instigators merit understanding – of their circumstances, if not of their actions. They may have been more hot-headed than others, but the prisoners had collectively been driven to desperation by the poverty and randomness of the regime. Nonetheless, prisoners and staff connived, in a sense, to bring the insurrection under control before any mortal damage was done. It is interesting that they left the library untouched.

It would be easy to attribute blame for the riot to the local actors, but that would represent a profound injustice and a failure to understand the horrors and complexities of prison. The staff at all levels at HMP Bedford have awed me by their consistent courage, loyalty, resilience, ready sense of decency and professionalism in the face of increasingly overwhelming odds. This was evidenced over months of difficulty and in spades on the day of the riot when prisoners, having stoically endured a seemingly endlessly deteriorating and irregular regime, lost faith in the prison management’s use of authority as having legitimacy, abandoned the implicit pact, and “kicked off”. They had cried for help, as had the IMB, the officers, and the governor to her superiors – but no one at the top of the tree heard their pleas. Who, then, was blameworthy?

I arrive at the following conclusions. The cost-cutting demanded of Noms, and, by extension, of individual prisons, has taken on the dimensions of an extreme human experiment, which in the social sciences these days would be blocked on ethical grounds. . There was no attempt to introduce these reforms gradually at a national level, or on a pilot basis, and then learn from the experience. There was no “evidence base” for these reforms. and no attempt to collect any. They were thus driven purely by ideology and finance. In general, the prison system seems reluctant to set up mechanisms whereby it can learn from its mistakes. The trial has failed also because the premise upon which it was based is misconceived. Prisons are being asked to achieve the unachievable.

Successive ministers have cut costs in the face of insistent warnings from many quarters, including the prison officers’ and the prison governors’ associations, the chief inspector of prisons, the IMBs and the many prison reform lobbying organisations. The only response has been about readjusting budgets over an extended period. Even though the new justice secretary, Liz Truss, has acknowledged (in her recent white paper) that cost-cutting has driven prisons to an extreme where they are not even able to operate safely, no proportionate or urgent action has been taken by the politicians and top civil servants in the MoJ who are responsible for the crisis in prisons. This is a devastating failure of accountability. They must acknowledge responsibility for the damage done.

The recent prison riots are testimony to a slow-burn build-up of misery and conflict that has blighted the lives of the prison’s many communities. I would particularly highlight the intolerable burdens that have been placed on officers and managers, as this is seldom sufficiently recognised. At last, it is being acknowledged that prisons cannot  be reformed without high-quality, motivated staff – and this is not simply about having the money to pay them a decent salary (although that is a necessary precondition).

Staff members have to be assured that their contribution is valued and that they will be trained and supported to do a difficult job in a meaningful way, especially when they are in the early stages of their career. Most prison officers do not go into the service to bang people up, but to help people change. Making the job so mechanical that it loses its meaning has led to a situation where it is as difficult to retain staff as it is to recruit them.

Criminal justice is a political playground, leading to endless changes in emphasis and policy. Prison budgets have not been ringfenced during “austerity”. In consequence, we have massively overcrowded and under-staffed older prisons, some of which are truly shocking, and that is unworthy of a nation that instinctively tends to assume it is a moral model for the rest of the world. Across the country, our prisons have failed to deliver against their social contract to “reform” offenders – so systematically that it is unclear that prisons (especially large ones) can ever deliver this while the political climate remains as it is.

A new vision is needed with an emphasis on integrating and accessing the insight contained within the system, . One such vision comprises three principal departures from current thinking. First, sentencing guidance would change radically to substitute community penalties for imprisonment for the vast majority of offences. for which research has shown that incarceration does not generally reduce reoffending. Second, there would be a properly resourced community sentence and probation service centre (CSPSC) in every major town to provide offenders with support, advice, help with housing and employment, remedial education and vocational training, alongside traditional probation service functions. Third, integrated into these centres would be small and local prisons so that all but the few prisoners who need high security jails more security and with intensive support to live safely, remain close to their roots. These new integrated centres would work most effectively if they formed a thriving and well-connected part of local life.

And what of the future for HMP Bedford? Its accessibility is such a huge asset that it merits the necessary investment, as long as the prison population is reduced to a level that allows it to offer personal attention, in a safe and calm environment overseen by an adequate number of experienced staff. Only then can a rehabilitative ethos have a chance to be effective.

It could even take part in the pilot roll-out of my proposed CSPSCs.

Zoe Williams (Forget Fidel Castro’s policies. Above all, he was a dictator, 28November) bases her judgment of Castro on a frighteningly simplistic division of states into democracies, by implication multiparty ones, and dictatorships, by implication any state that is not multiparty. She then makes a blanket assertion that the latter are so inherently bad that their actual record of government is irrelevant. This is to ignore all the complex details of political structures by which a population can be oppressed or empowered. For us, from a practical point of view, the worst danger of such thinking is to exaggerate the benefits of our political system.

While Castro may be rightly criticised for executing Batista supporters, even those guilty of torture and multiple murder, it may be salutary to remember that back then, in 1959, Britain executed people accused of a single murder. It was also a time when British forces were imprisoning and torturing Kenyans, and those of the French multiparty democracy were torturing and killing Algerians. Even those crimes pale before the horrors the US multiparty democracy was shortly to unleash on Vietnam.

Turning to the present day and the issue of political freedoms, it is fair to condemn Cuba if people are being arrested for oppositional comment but important to bear in mind that the distinction between criticism and treachery is controversial, as illustrated by the fate of Chelsea Manning. It is reasonable to argue that a single-party state lacks effective mechanisms for kicking out an unpopular government, but we should also wonder whether the convergence of mainstream parties behind austerity and the increasingly low turnouts at elections in the UK are a sign that our mechanisms have ceased to be effective.

• While UK press coverage of Fidel Castro’s death has been largely hostile, my own views and memories are mixed, as I was “our man in Havana” for Reuters from 1960 to 1962, a period spanning the Bay of Pigs debacle and the Cuban missile crisis.

In July 1962, well after midnight, I, my wife Olivia and Gavin Young of the Observer were walking near the Hotel Nacional when we saw a large car and a familiar silhouette. Gavin rashly stuck his hand in at the car window, introduced himself and said: “Come and have a drink with us, Dr Castro.” He reluctantly agreed to join us “for a quarter of an hour”.

At the nearby Club 21, Castro sat with the three of us for over two hours – something of a scoop for us, though he gave little away. At one point he said: “Señora Bland, you have a little boy, yes? Does he receive his milk ration?” Olivia told him: “Actually, no.” Shortly afterwards our son got his regular milk.

Two months later, the missile crisis blew up. I drove past a Soviet missile site taking photos of sinister 60-foot-long cylinders under tarpaulins, then was chased off by the secret police, the G2.

Two days later they arrested me and took me to G2 headquarters. Reuters gallantly interceded directly with Castro, so I spent only six days in jail and was deported, very conveniently, to Jamaica, where my wife had recently given birth to our second son. The guards’ treatment was cold but civil; I heard no stories of torture or beatings.

• Richard Gott (Obituary, 28 November) is right to say that Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir were boundless in their admiration for Fidel Castro, at least to begin with, and the two were guests of the revolution from 22 February to 21 March 1960. But in 1971, in part because of the imprisonment of the Cuban poet Heberto Padilla, both severed links with Castro and the Cuban regime. Sartre died in 1980 and Beauvoir in 1986, and did not return to the Castro fold.

• Richard Gott does not explain how Fidel Castro managed to retain power for over half a century. He could have mentioned the Committees for the Defence of the Revolution (CDR), set up to spy on the Cuban populace and identify potential dissidents. Each adult Cuban was expected to belong to the local CDR, which was in turn required to keep a file on each of its members. The CDR network was organised with the friendly assistance of the East German Stasi, and based on the system operating in East Germany. The latter was merely a refinement of the Blockleiter system set up in 1935 to control the population of Nazi Germany. Interestingly, the regimes in Nazi Germany, East Germany and Cuba all believed in elections with only one candidate for each seat, and in securing massive voter turnout. Hitler, Honecker, Castro: it really does seem that great minds think alike.

• If the people of St Vincent want to honour the memory of Fidel Castro, surely it is appropriate for the representative of their monarchy to respect their wishes without interference from the British (‘Awkward moment’ for Prince Harry in minute’s silence for Fidel Castro, theguardian.com, 27 November). The attitude of many in Britain has more than a whiff of colonialism.

• Zoe Williams’ usually excellent judgment has let her down when she says of Fidel Castro that “What matters is that he was a dictator”, because she forgets the context of a Latin America in the 1950s dominated by rightwing despots, with every effort to replace them with progressive governments being ended by military force. This would continue well into the 1980s, and even in the last decade we have seen two elected, progressive leaders fall to rightwing coups.

How does she think a peaceful transformation from revolution to democracy should be secured? Here in Nicaragua, the 1979 revolution was followed by an election in 1984 which was not recognised by the US because it gave the “wrong” result. It was not until 1990, when the electorate correctly chose capitalism, that the US accepted the ballot as valid. It then took 16 years to restore a left-of-centre government, which is now again under threat of US sanctions.

Nowhere in Latin America has suffered the baleful influence of US intervention more than Cuba, for reasons of history and geography. The Batista regime was one of the most barbarous in the continent, with its corruption accentuated by the mafia’s control of Havana’s main businesses, yet it was unflinchingly supported by successive US governments. Castro had to defend the revolution’s achievements against the threats both of the US government itself and of the Miami-based terrorist groups who bombed Cuban planes and hotels with impunity, well into the 1990s. Nor has any other country so dependent on US commerce seen its economy strangled by a 50-year embargo, which applies not to just to US firms but to any firm that trades with the US.

What was Castro supposed to do, meekly hold elections on terms acceptable to the US, in which millions of dollars would have poured into the country to ensure the “right” result? And then see Cuba return to the oligarchs who still control countries like Honduras and Guatemala? He was well aware that even the mildest leftwing government wouldn’t have been acceptable to the US in a country only 100 miles from its borders. By not acknowledging that, Zoe, you ignore 60 years of US intervention in Central America and the Caribbean.

• Reference is rightly made to the fine role Cuba played in supporting opposition to apartheid and also in support of liberation struggles in Angola and Mozambique. I’ve not seen comment on Cuba’s support for Mengistu Haile Mariam when Ethiopia was invaded by the Somali forces of Siad Barre. What is the judgment? Mengistu eventually ousted (to sanctuary in Zimbabwe), Siad forced out and dead; Somalia in a very sorry state and Ethiopia again in some turmoil after a period of relative contentment.

• Like Zoe Williams, I too was in Cuba in the 90s. In 1993 I returned for the first time since 1960 when, during the euphoric early days of the revolution, I spent two months with an international work brigade on the construction of a rural residential school. By contrast, 1993 was a truly terrible year for Cuba. Most supposedly informed observers confidently predicted the imminent collapse of the economy and thought that Cuba would follow the USSR and the eastern European states into oblivion.

It is inexcusable to deplore the conditions of extreme hardship endured by the Cuban people without referring to their causes. On top of the US economic blockade of Cuba – which was accurately described by Noam Chomsky as the harshest in the world (harsher than the sanctions imposed on Iraq prior to the 2003 invasion), and which in 1993 had already been in place for 33 years – in 1992 Cuba also had to contend with the collapse of the Soviet Union and the overnight loss of 75% of its foreign trade. No other country has had to endure an economic calamity of such proportions. To not only have survived but to have provided its people with a free education and public health system renowned throughout the world for their excellence is an achievement without parallel.

There is nothing comparable to the 57-year-old relentless, punitive hostility with which the greatest superpower has treated a small, poor third-world country.

• I didn’t recognise Zoe Williams’ caricature of Cuba under Fidel Castro. Yes, Havana may look a little dowdy – but what a relief not to be bombarded with advertising, and the painstaking, carefully planned restoration of the old city (hardly likely under capitalism) has earned it Unesco world heritage site status.

If Zoe Williams had ventured a little away from the modestly stocked shops – unsurprising given the devastating US economic boycott, which has also depleted the “elegantly appointed” pharmacies she mocks – she would have found a vibrant musical and cultural life savoured by the Cuban people.

It’s true that prostitution – virtually eliminated prior to the fall of Soviet communism – made a comeback with the need to promote international tourism. But given a choice between a country that values every one of its citizens and nurtures their abilities, and one where food banks and beggars on street corners are in danger of becoming the norm, is there really any contest?

Peter Godfrey

• We have just returned from Cuba, which we have visited regularly over the last 20 years, and we don’t recognise the country described by Zoe Williams and by the media generally. Cuba is a third-world country because it has been hammered by over 50 years of the illegal US blockade. Nor do we recognise the label of dictator. Cuba has a democracy. Members of its government do not need to be wealthy. They are farmers and shopkeepers; doctors and taxi drivers. In other words, they are citizens selected and elected by their peers. They choose their ministers, who then choose their leader. This is a very different model of democracy to ours. There are no political parties and no political campaigns. Compare that with the US, where $2.6bn was spent, resulting in the election of Donald Trump!

Castro walked the streets of Havana safely despite over 500 attempts on his life by the CIA. He is revered by his people – even the BBC in a report on Sunday acknowledged that the young people in Cuba think favourably of him. Perhaps Cuba’s achievements in the fields of free education and healthcare have some bearing on this. This so-called dictator lived in a relatively humble home on the outskirts of Havana and sought no financial gain for himself, only a better life for his fellow citizens.

Castro challenged the western world, and that is why it despised him and why the western media portrayed him in the way that they did. The pity is that so many people believe that Cuba has been, and is being, oppressed by its leaders. Our visit this month confirmed our belief that in Cuba, despite the hardships that the people have to endure, the majority of the population are cheerful, friendly and content with the egalitarian system that Castro introduced.

• The Castro apologism from many on your letters page (28 November) is shameful. We can discuss US politics, blockades, education, literacy and socialism all we want, but we would be missing the point. It is painfully ironic that those who claim to be progressive are so willing to throw these aims out the window when it comes to brutal dictators who oppress and murder anyone who thinks differently to them. Perhaps it tells us what the left’s true aims are. Not equality for all but a vicious hatred of the United States. If standing against the US means throwing gay rights under the bus, then so be it. If standing against the US means throwing religious freedom under the bus, then so be it. If standing against the US means supporting a vicious, brutal, uncompromising, murderous dictator then, it seems, so be it.

It is about time the left took a long hard look at themselves. The moral hypocrisy and arrogance is breathtaking and disgraceful. I am ashamed and they should be too.

The White House has repudiated Donald Trump’s assertion that protesters who burn the American flag should potentially be imprisoned or stripped of their citizenship.

The president-elect tweeted early on Tuesday: “Nobody should be allowed to burn the American flag – if they do, there must be consequences – perhaps loss of citizenship or year in jail!”

It was unclear what had triggered the comment, but it appeared to coincide with a report on the Fox News channel about students at a college in Massachusetts allegedly burning a flag in protest at his shock election win. Trump is known to be an avid consumer of cable TV news.

Josh Earnest, the White House spokesman, told reporters that freedom of expression was enshrined in the US constitution. “The need to protect those rights is in place to protect speech and expression not just when we agree with it but also when we find it offensive,” he said.

“Many Americans – the vast majority of Americans, myself included – find the burning of the flag offensive but we have a responsibility as a country to carefully protect our rights that are enshrined in the constitution.”

Earnest added: “This is a bipartisan sentiment. I know that there are conservatives on the supreme court that share the view that I’ve just articulated. I know that there are Democrats and Republicans in the United States Congress that share the view I’ve just articulated, and it certainly is consistent with the kind of governing agenda that President Obama has pursued here in the White House during his eight years in the Oval Office.”

Asked if the president, who has spoken to Trump by phone more than once since the election, was concerned about such views, Earnest replied: “This is not the first thing that the president-elect has said or tweeted that President Obama disagrees with.”

Freedom of speech extended to Twitter, he said, “so there’s a little irony in this situation”.

The supreme court ruled in 1989 that flag-burning is “expressive conduct” protected by the first amendment. Among those voting with the court majority in the Texas v Johnson case was the late justice Antonin Scalia, for whom Trump has regularly expressed admiration.

Asked about Trump’s comments, Mitch McConnell, the Republican Senate majority leader, said he supported the supreme court’s decision.



“The supreme court has held that that activity is a protected first amendment right, a form of unpleasant speech,” McConnell told reporters on Capitol Hill. 



“In this country we have a long tradition of respecting unpleasant speech.”

Joe Manchin, a Democratic senator from West Virginia, also agreed that flag-burning was a constitutional right.

But he added: “If you do it in front of me, I’m going to beat the hell out of you.”

Trump’s proposal was also condemned as unconstitutional on another count. In a 1967 case, Afroyim v Rusk, the supreme court ruled that the constitution does not allow the government to take away an individual’s citizenship against their will.

Shane Kadidal, a senior managing attorney at the Center for Constitutional Rights, said: “There are two baseline constitutional tenets that he manages to screw up in 140 characters.”



Scalia was among the judges in the case that established that flag burning is “constitutionally protected speech”, Kadidal added, while “it’s even more established, by half a century, that one can only lose one’s citizenship by voluntary means”.

Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond, said: “The supreme court has spoken in the flag-burning case. The constitutionality of that is pretty settled. The law is clear and has been for some time.

“Burning the flag is widely seen as a social taboo but not a legal one. It’s a freedom we’ve had for 200 years and it had to trump the other interests, no matter how vile we might think that activity is. Justice Scalia thought the constitution had to be paramount.”

Trump has previously been accused of showing little respect for the US constitution. Khizr Khan, a Muslim whose son was killed while serving in Iraq, memorably questioned at the Democratic national convention whether the celebrity businessman had even read it.

On Tuesday, there was also criticism from Trump’s own party. David Frum, a former speechwriter for President George W Bush and now a senior editor of the Atlantic, tweeted: “If flag-burning merits loss of citizenship, what should be the penalty for a Nazi salute by a Trump supporter?”

He also posted: “Donald Trump’s political career is one protracted flag burning. The symbols of the Republic properly belong to his opponents.”

Congressman Sean Duffy, a Republican from Wisconsin, told CNN: “We want to protect those people who want to protest … I disagree with Mr Trump on that.”

Trump would not be the first president to attempt a ban on flag burning. The Flag Protection Act of 1989 was supported by George HW Bush before it was ruled unconstitutional, and the Flag Protection Act of 2005, another failed attempt to criminalise flag burning, was co-sponsored by then senator Hillary Clinton.

The latter effort was also supported by Harry Reid, now the outgoing Senate Democratic leader. Reid said on Tuesday his vote was not equivalent to what Trump was suggesting.



“We know Trump tweeted that he feels that someone who burns a flag should lose their citizenship,” the Nevada Democrat told reporters in his weekly press conference on Capitol Hill. “I don’t agree with him; he’s gone way too far.”



Arizona senator John McCain said he also disapproved of burning the flag but declined to address Trump’s specific claim that people who do so should lose their citizenship.



“I think there should be some punishment, but right now the supreme court decision is that people are free to express themselves that way,” McCain told CNN.

“There’s other ways for people to express their views rather than to burn a flag that so many fought and died for.”

The 2008 Republican presidential nominee grew testy, however, when pressed further on Trump’s views.



“I’m not commenting on Mr Trump’s comments,” McCain said. “I have not and will not.”

“That may be your priority, to comment every day on any comment that Mr Trump has,” he added of reporters. “My priority is to try to defend the nation and the men and women who are serving it.”

Not for the first time, the president-elect’s Twitter habits deflected attention from transition business, although that too is being played out in an unusually public manner. He has now held 68 meetings with potential administration members, transition spokesperson Sean Spicer said.

On Tuesday, Trump named representative Tom Price as health secretary and, according to reports, planned to name Elaine Chao as transportation secretary.

Chao, who was labour secretary under Bush, is married to McConnell. She was also a member of Trump’s Asian Pacific American Advisory Council during his presidential campaign.



Price, an orthopaedic surgeon from Georgia, has spent more than a decade in Congress and influenced the healthcare plan that the House speaker, Paul Ryan, is pushing as an alternative to Barack Obama’s signature Affordable Care Act. Price is also a fierce opponent of abortion rights and described the legalisation of gay marriage as “a sad day for marriage”.

For Democrats it was yet another ominously rightwing appointment. The incoming Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, said Price “has proven to be far out of the mainstream of what Americans want when it comes to Medicare, the Affordable Care Act, and Planned Parenthood”.

Schumer said those programmes have helped millions of Americans, including “seniors, families, people with disabilities and women, have access to quality, affordable healthcare. Nominating Congressman Price to be the HHS [health and human services] secretary is akin to asking the fox to guard the hen house.”

The House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi, said: “If Tom Price has his way with the Affordable Care Act, millions of families who have finally found affordable coverage for themselves and their children will be pushed back into the cold. Doctors would be hounded out of lifesaving research, and women would be denied their right to contraception and comprehensive healthcare.”

Trump was due to have dinner on Tuesday night with Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee for president in 2012 and a former foe who is now in contention for the position of secretary of state. The president-elect will begin a “thank you tour” on Thursday night with a rally in Cincinnati, Ohio.

Victims of abuse are finding it increasingly difficult to bring claims for compensation to court because of cuts to legal aid and high legal fees, the inquiry into child sexual abuse has heard.



In its first public seminar, the independent inquiry chaired by Prof Alexis Jay was also told that proposals to introduce a fixed costs regime could add a further barrier to justice.

Luke Daniels, a solicitor with the firm Irwin Mitchell, said it now costs £10,000 to issue a claim. Some cases were later dropped because the costs involved were deemed by the Legal Aid Agency to be disproportionate to any likely future award. 



Peter Garsden, a solicitor with Simpson Millar and president of the Association of Child Abuse Lawyers, said legal aid had been cut back heavily. “People who go through abuse cases are generally unable to work,” he said, “and from the lower income thresholds. 



“There’s a poverty gap where you can’t afford civil litigation but don’t qualify for public funding. The equity in your house is taken into account [in testing entitlement to legal aid].

Garsden added: “Persuading the Legal Aid Agency that your case has merit is a huge amount of work. The special cases unit in Brighton require you to prove everything and take nothing on trust. Some [lawyers] don’t deal with legal aid because it requires so much effort.”

Jonathan Bridge, a solicitor with the law firm Farleys in Manchester, said: “There are an increasingly large number of experts who will not work at legal aid rates. They will not prepare reports at legal aid rates. That’s particularly a problem with adult and child psychiatrists.”

Dave Enright, of the solicitors firm Howe and Co in London, said there was consequently “a very small pool of practitioners”. He said: “It’s badly paid. The work is so complex and that’s part of the barrier.”

Asked by counsel to the inquiry Peter Skelton QC whether that prevented access to justice, Enright replied: “Absolutely. Because there will be huge [advice] deserts around the country.” Large parts of the country did not have local lawyers who are experts on abuse.

“There’s a chilling effect. The people who come to us are the tip of the iceberg. The overwhelming majority never come forward. They suffer from the chilling effect of these changes in legal funding by which they have to make financial judgments about whether or not to take cases forward.”

Most claims for abuse are settled for relatively modest sums, according to evidence from solicitors who specialise in sexual abuse cases. Richard Scorer, of the law firm Slater and Gordon, said: “Average awards are around £15,000, typically in the £10,000 to £40,000 range. 



“Big figure awards are very unusual. There’s a difficulty in proving loss of earnings. It’s usually a modest award for disadvantage in the labour market. The highest awards have been £600,000 to £700,000.”

The oldest case of abuse Scorer said he had reached a settlement on dated back to 1955. Because of rules on limitations, he added, few were likely to succeed much before that date.

Garsden said 80% of abuse involves someone already known to the victim. “Those are non-institutional cases,” he said. “They are deserving but can you pursue them?”

Cases against institutions mostly date from the 1960s to the mid-1980s before foster care became more common. “What all survivors of abuse want is their day in court and to be believed and to be listened to,” Garsden said.



A further threat to litigation, the solicitors explained, is a new regime of fixed costs for all claims. Lord Justice Jackson has been commissioned to undertake a review of fixed recoverable costs, to be completed by July 2017. “Fixed cost regimes would render most of these cases unviable,” Garsden added.

Experts from the insurance world also gave evidence. They denied that new policies were being produced that included exclusion clauses for claims involving sexual molestation.

One insurer insisted that his company would never suggest there had ever been consent to sexual offences by those aged under 16. The seminar was told, however, that the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority had in one unusual case considered a 14-year-old to have consented.

An injured police officer whose wife wants doctors to withdraw life support treatment has shown some signs of improvement, a court has heard.

But the court of protection hearing in Manchester heard that PC Paul Briggs, 43, remained in a minimally conscious state and was still unable to consistently respond to yes or no questions using a buzzer.

Briggs, whose wife, Lindsey, has asked the court to stop his treatment, sustained a brain haemorrhage, five fractures in his spine, bruising to internal organs and several other severe injuries in a crash in July last year.

The Gulf war veteran, from Wirral, Merseyside, is being cared for at the Walton Centre in Liverpool.

Specialist speech and language therapist Mary Ankers told the court there was still potential for Briggs to emerge from the minimally conscious state.

She said: “His responses in terms of command following ... have certainly become more consistent.”

The court heard staff would give Briggs a buzzer and ask him to press it, before moving on to ask him questions which he could respond to by pressing the buzzer once for yes or twice for no.

Ankers said in 47 out of 64 sessions he had been able to respond to commands from staff at least once, which she said was an improvement on an assessment earlier this year.

But she said his response to higher-level tasks was “highly inconsistent”.

The judge, Mr Justice Charles, questioned whether one of the assessments, which had reported Briggs had responded to a number of questions using the buzzer, was “dodgy” as it did not follow the proper process.

Ankers agreed the results of that session should be treated with great caution.

The report showed Briggs had used the buzzer to answer a number of questions about himself and indicated yes when asked if he was in pain.

The frozen food retailer Iceland is sending a “high-level delegation” to Reykjavik this week in an attempt to thaw relations with the Icelandic government after it launched legal action against the chain over the use of its name.

Iceland Foods is urgently seeking a meeting with Iceland’s foreign ministry to set out “constructive proposals” that could help break the deadlock and resume a longstanding “peaceful coexistence” that it says has prevailed for nearly half a century.

Iceland is challenging Iceland Foods’ exclusive ownership of the European-wide trademark registration for the word Iceland, which it says is preventing the country’s companies from promoting goods and services abroad.

The Icelandic government claims the supermarket has “aggressively pursued” and won multiple cases against companies that use the word Iceland as part of its trademark, “even in cases when the products and services do not compete”.

The supermarket’s founder and chief executive, Malcolm Walker, said on Tuesday: “A high-level delegation from Iceland [Foods] is preparing to fly to Reykjavik this week to begin negotiations, and we very much hope for a positive response and an early resolution of this issue.”

The retailer’s company secretary and legal director, Duncan Vaughan, will be leading the delegation in the next few days, but it will not include Walker.

Walker said: “We registered Iceland as our company name in 1970 and we have coexisted with the country called Iceland very happily ever since. They have made no contact with us to raise any concerns about trademark issues since 2012.

“We have no desire whatsoever to stand in the way of Iceland the country making use of their own name to promote their own products, so long as it does not conflict or cause confusion with our own business. I am sure there is ample scope for an agreement that will allow both parties to continue to live and work amicably alongside each other.”

The company, whose headquarters are in Deeside, has more than 800 stores in the UK and employs more than 23,000 staff. It holds a Europe-wide trademark registration for the word, and Iceland the country is seeking to invalidate the registration on the basis that it is “exceptionally broad and ambiguous in definition, often rendering the country’s firms unable to describe their products as Icelandic”.

In a circular released last week, the government stated: “The government of Iceland is concerned that our country’s businesses are unable to promote themselves across Europe in association with their place of origin – a place of which we are rightly proud and enjoys a very positive national branding.”

In an explanatory statement, the retailer added that it did not simply take its name from the Nordic state, but has a long history of close and friendly involvement with the country.

“For seven years from 2005, Iceland Foods was under the control of Icelandic investors and later Icelandic banks. This relationship came to an end with the £1.5bn management buyout of the company in 2012, but Iceland the company has continued to have a warm relationship with Iceland the country through the ownership of three Iceland stores there, export sales of Iceland products to other retailers throughout the country, and sponsorship of the Icelandic national team in this year’s European football championships.”



The retailer claimed “the closeness and friendliness of relations” was underlined when Walker welcomed then Icelandic prime minister, Halldór Ásgrimsson, on an official visit to Iceland’s Fulham Road store in south-west London in 2006.

Magistrates are resigning in “considerable” numbers, the head of their national body has said, after scores of court closures and swingeing government cuts.

Forty-seven magistrates courts have shut this year, one-tenth of courts in England and Wales, with significant numbers of judges resigning early from the unpaid position.

Malcolm Richardson, the chairman of the Magistrates Association, said: “Magistrates deal with more than 90% of the criminal cases that come to court and they cost 1% of the HM Courts and Tribunal Service budget. But we’re getting a bit tired of being treated like the 1% and not the 90%.”



The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) would not disclose the number of magistrates who had resigned this year, but the association said the figure was considerable.

It comes after at least 75 magistrates resigned last year over the controversial criminal courts charge, which caused outrage among law groups before it was scrapped by Michael Gove.

The mass resignations and court closures have left the magistracy stretched, Richardson said, adding that “nobody [in government] seems to have a plan” for the future of the volunteer judges.

“There is no evidence of a strategy for the use of magistrates. What are we for the in 21st century? What are we for in the brave new world, which is starting to be revealed under the courts reform programme?” he said.

“Magistrates feel they are not, and have not been, engaged with in the determination of what that future looks like … The consequences of that for some magistrates, particularly those who are getting towards retirement, is to say ‘why am I carrying on?’ It’s a difficult question to answer.”

Three magistrates who have resigned or retired since September told the Guardian morale was at rock bottom among the judges, who are only paid expenses.

They said magistrates felt ignored and unappreciated as a result of cost cutting, ranging from court closures to buildings falling into disrepair. More trivial money-saving measures, such as cutting back on coffee and newspapers in the judges’ quarters, and using cheaper, thinner paper, had also irritated the magistracy, they said.

Janet Alcock, a Conservative councillor in Clitheroe, Lancashire, said she “resigned in despair” in September after 20 years as a magistrate. The role has been reduced to a “soul-destroying production line” of speeding fines and licence fee evasions, Alcock said, adding that she gave up encouraging people to become magistrates a long time ago.

Alcock said she had become “extremely frustrated” at having to issue fines to defendants who would never be able to pay, and the victim surcharge, which “just seems to be another way of dressing up that they’re taking more money off them”.

“You know, realistically, from the point of view of collecting the fines, you’re not going to get it, which makes it extremely frustrating,” she said. “Everybody’s always calling me ‘the hanging judge’ because I’m saying things like instead of fining people who can’t afford it, send them out working … Political correctness wouldn’t allow you to do anything like that.

“But that would be far more satisfying to the public, I think, than for people to appear six months later owing even more than they did at the beginning. It’s just frustrating for everybody.”

Myra Robinson, who retired last month as a bench chairman of Newcastle magistrates, said fining those who could not afford to pay was morally wrong, but there was little that magistrates could do about it. “It’s just ticking boxes and following down – if someone did this then that’s the punishment. There’s no flexibility,” she said.

“I’d worked all my career with young offenders and kids with problems. I felt I knew a lot of the families with problems in Newcastle, and I could see behind what they’d just done and think what would be an appropriate way of dealing with it. My hands have been tied for many years now. People can’t afford fines.”

A third recently resigned magistrate, who did not want to be named, said the court closures meant “losing local justice for local people”. In some cases, proposed closures meant it would be impossible for defendants or witnesses travelling by public transport to get to a court for 10am.

“I was constantly getting emails or texts or phone calls to say that we urgently need magistrates to sit in places like Scarborough. That would imply there is a shortage,” said the magistrate, who was based nearly 90 miles (145km) away in Halifax, west Yorkshire.

Forty-seven magistrates courts closed their doors between March and September under government proposals to reduce the £500m annual cost of the courts estate. A further 45 are due to shut by September 2017, meaning one-fifth of all courts in England and Wales will have disappeared in 19 months.

An MoJ spokeswoman said: “The magistracy remains at the heart of our justice system. We are investing £1bn to reform and digitise our courts to deliver swifter justice, and we are working closely with the judiciary to encourage the recruitment of underrepresented groups.

“Closing underused and dilapidated court buildings will allow us to reinvest in the justice system and make the best use of technology, improving the experience for all court users, in particular vulnerable victims and witnesses.”

With Nigeria’s parliament poised to extend a controversial law banning the “menace of street begging” throughout the country, campaigners are warning the policy has already resulted in the persecution of tens of thousands of disabled and mentally ill citizens.

Street begging is illegal in Lagos, Nigeria’s most populous city, and carries fines of around N15,000 (£38) and up to three months’ imprisonment. Those who fail to pay the fine are incarcerated until they are able to pay up.

But due to poor medical support, the people begging on Lagos’s street are disproportionately made up of mentally ill and disabled citizens, and human rights activists say tens of thousands of vulnerable people have been detained over the past five years as a result of the ban.

Megan Chapman, a human rights lawyer and director of the local NGO Justice and Empowerment Initiatives (JEI), said the “scale of human rights violations is massive and extremely concerning”, and added the treatment may be illegal under the country’s constitution.

Though campaigners from JEI acknowledged that begging is also banned in other cities across the world, they claim the ban is policed brutally and without transparency in Lagos. “It’s hard to find a city enforcing the ban in as inhumane a way as Lagos is,” Chapman said.

Despite widespread calls from NGOs and activists for the state to reconsider its policy, the Nigerian senate is now considering a bill to ban begging nationwide.

The bill, proposed by Senator Isah Misau, has substantial backing in the senate, with lawmakers claiming the increase in begging is caused by criminal exploitation rather than poor economic conditions in Nigeria, which is now officially in recession.

Speaking in support of the proposed legislation, Misau said: “Street begging affects not only the geographical and social structure of urban areas; it also portrays the country in a bad light to tourists and foreign visitors.”



Lagos state’s governor, Akinwunmi Ambode, has backed the crackdown on street begging. “We’ve had security reports on the activities of persons who pose as beggars, especially in traffic, but their sole aim is to perpetrate evil,” he said in July.

The state government said in April that 1,340 beggars, destitute and “mentally challenged persons” had been “rescued” from the streets of Lagos in the past year. During this period, it said 590 “rehabilitees” had been released and reunited with their relatives for re-integration, while 1,228 people were rehabilitated at what it referred to as a “rehabilitation and training centre” in Majidun, on mainland Lagos.

In addition, according to a leaked memo cited on the Nigerian site PM News, 413 beggars and “lunatics” were reportedly evacuated from Lagos’s streets by government officials between March and July this year.

Most of those detained for begging are taken to the holding facility by the so-called “rescue team” from the Lagos State Youth and Development Ministry, which enforces the ban.

The centre was opened as part of a drive to clean up the city in the 1970s. State officials claim it is used to help and treat beggars and people who are physically or mentally ill, yet reports from former detainees paint a different picture.

Men and women held there have described torturous conditions, claiming to have been denied basic rights and medical attention, held in confined spaces, often for years, without a fair hearing.

“We have met dozens of people arrested for begging who have been made to pay a hefty bribe, who have been deprived of their liberty for months or even years. Not one of them has ever been taken before a court of law. It is a serious violation of their rights under the Nigerian constitution,” she said.

“What we’ve been pressing the state government to do is to have a root and branch overhaul of the system; stop the mass incarcerations that impact on the health and well-being of the beggars.”

Workers from JEI, along with the Physically Challenged Empowerment Initiative (PCEI), a grassroots organisation campaigning against the detentions, have looked after several people after their release from the centre.

Among them was 25-year-old Yakubu Idris. After his arrest and 20-month detention at the Majidun facility, his health deteriorated. Interviewed hours after his release, he said: “Now I cannot walk – I cannot even stand up from the floor.”

Despite suffering from extensive infections and a respiratory problem, Idris said he was denied medical treatment by officials at the facility. “In the cell I totally forgot how long I was there because I was never let out. Then one day theoga [boss] took two of us and released us,” he said.

A week later, tests for tuberculosis came back positive, but Idris died before he could receive treatment.

Chapman said calls for change by local NGOs were slowly being heeded, but the proposed bill threatened to undermine years of work to change attitudes towards beggars.

“We have pointed out that current practices are completely unconstitutional and fail to address the social problems of destitution and street begging. The focus should be on helping the poor and people living with disabilities to find alternative livelihoods,” she said.

Under the previous Lagos state governor, scores of beggars were routinely deported to their states of origin. In 2011, 3,029 people were deported from Lagos. Dolapo Badru, a state government spokesman at the time, defended the measures, arguing that “beggars and destitutes constitute a social nuisance towards the development of Lagos as a mega-city”.

Muhammed Zanna, one of the founders of the PCEI in Lagos said negative perceptions of the poor had led to widespread apathy about the way they are treated by the state.

“Governor Ambode wants to create a modern city and the poor don’t fit into that vision,” said Zanna.

“The state doesn’t see beggars as real people, just as people to hide or to send away. People who have no interaction with the poor or disabled have this idea that they are really criminals and drug dealers, so even when the state services maltreats them people don’t show any concern,” Zanna said.

State officials at the youth ministry did not respond to requests for comment.

Officials at the facility in Majidun denied detainees were kept in harsh conditions indefinitely or denied basic rights, and claimed a doctor was available to provide treatment. They also say it is merely “a temporary holding site” until fines are paid or a hearing takes place.

Forty-year-old Binta Muhammadu was arrested in February with her two children, aged two and four. When she couldn’t pay the fine, she was detained at Majidun for nine months, with her children held elsewhere. “In that time I only saw my children three times,” she said.

According to Binta, “there were about 50 of us in the same room, where we bathed, ate and slept. We were never let out,” she said.

“I don’t know what I will do now that I am free,” she added. “I don’t have anything and I can’t walk well any more. This has just made things worse for me than it was before.”

At the heart of the latest allegations swirling around George Brandis, the chronically dysfunctional first law officer, is the claim that he failed in his duty to protect the constitution and the revenue in order to perform a favour to political soulmates in the government of Western Australia.

That was what the West Australian newspaper said on Friday, in a useful article that tied together some of the loose strands still flapping in the wake of Brandis’ entanglement with the former solicitor general, Justin Gleeson.

If the allegation is true then it would be unconscionable for Brandis to remain attorney general.

It was asserted by the paper that Brandis instructed the solicitor general not to run an argument in the high court on behalf of the commissioner of taxation that would jeopardise legislation passed by the Western Australian parliament to close down the long-running Bell litigation, where creditors were fighting over the carve-up of assets from the carcass of Alan Bond’s corporate interests.

Instead of lawyers in court scrapping over money, the WA government wanted to take control and arrange its own scheme of distribution. This was of immediate concern to the commissioner of taxation, who was in line for $300m in unpaid Bell taxes and concerned that he would be at the mercy of bureaucrats in Perth.

The Bell Act sought to alter, impair and detract from the commonwealth’s ability to enforce the recovery of a tax debt.

Gleeson thought it was constitutional law 101 that the WA legislation ran foul of the conflict of laws provision of the constitution.

The Taxation Commission sought the solicitor general’s advice and was told there was an excellent chance the high court would find what the law men from the wild west had done was invalid, which it duly found in May this year.

Brandis made a statement to the Senate on Monday, where for all the world he looked like a man whose career was balanced on eggshells. He said it was absurd for the opposition to say that he had “failed sufficiently to protect the interests of the commonwealth”.

There are a couple of things to note about those dates. The ATO intervened in the high court case on 8 March, while Brandis only allowed the commonwealth to get its foot in the door six days before the argument kicked off in the high court on 5 April.

One possible explanation for this delay was that the attorney general was trying to keep faith with the Western Australian Liberals, by at least staying the commonwealth’s hand, even though the ATO had independently decided to press ahead.

It was only when Gleeson came to see the attorney general sometime before 30 March, to insist that the commonwealth should intervene in the litigation that the government’s senior lawyers got the green light to be involved.

Brandis has tried to suggest that the commonwealth didn’t need to get involved because the commissioner of taxation had mounted his horse.

One other thing – it doesn’t wash for him to claim that the letters between Hockey and the WA treasurer, Mike Nahan, are not evidence of an agreement between the state and federal government. If anything, Hockey’s letter gives the Western Australians a great big, gleaming green light to press ahead with their Bell legislation. All the commonwealth treasurer was concerned about was ensuring Australia is an attractive destination for foreign investment. Here’s Hockey:

We actually have to go to the high court transcripts to get further and better particulars as to what went on.

On 8 February, seven weeks before the commonwealth intervened in the litigation, there was a directions hearing in the high court.

Dr James Watson, instructed by the Australian government solicitor, appeared and told Justice Virginia Bell:

One implication of what Watson told the court on 8 February was that the AG was still to decide on something he had in contemplation – yet the Senate was told that the first that Brandis had any “personal involvement” was 3 March.

This is something that any inquiry by a Senate committee might tease out.

The alternative position is that the government solicitor was acting without the attorney general’s knowledge, which stretches incredulity when it comes to a control freak like George Brandis, particularly in a high profile piece of politically sensitive litigation.

On the same day (8 February) barrister Anthony D’Arcy appeared for the Bell plaintiffs and said that his clients wanted a special case that embraced the legislation’s inconsistencies with both the Tax Act and the Corporations Act.

In other words, while Brandis later indicated he was chewing his fingernails about whether it was preferable to engage the Tax Act argument alone, the plaintiffs seven weeks earlier were pressing for an all-in case that included the Corporations Act.

The questions that Brandis’ statement to parliament did not answer are these:

A casual observer might think that protecting the commonwealth’s interests would involve getting on the bus from day one, not three weeks after the tax office was on the case and seven weeks after the AGS lawyers told the court the AG “has not yet made the decision to intervene”.

Then there is the timing of the 4 May super-duper Legal Services Direction, which required all government agencies (including the Commissioner of Taxation) to seek the attorney general’s approval before running off and getting advice from Gleeson. The attorney issued that direction 12 days before the high court handed down its decision.

All very puzzling. No doubt Justin Gleeson could clear up the confusion if he was asked to give evidence to another performance of the legal and constitutional affairs committee.

In the meantime, the lawyers can get back to feasting on the 25-year banquet that is the Bell creditors’ litigation.

The regime at the category C Hindley jail near Wigan is “one of the worst and possibly one of the very worst that inspectors had ever seen in this type of prison”, an official watchdog report has said.

The chief inspector of prisons, Peter Clarke, said the Hindley regime includes regular shutdowns when inmates, including young adults, are locked in their cells for more than 24 hours at a time.

His report published on Tuesday also highlights poor food, including mouldy bread, filthy cells, and a high level of violence with 126 assaults in just six months, including 35 fights. Half the prisoners told inspectors it was easy to get hold of illegal drugs, which were more accessible than clean clothes, sheets or books from the library.

Peter Dawson, the director of the Prison Reform Trust, said although they were used to dreadful inspection reports about dilapidated, overcrowded Victorian prisons, HMP Hindley “is none of these things, and this damning verdict is all the more troubling as a result”.

The latest critical inspection report comes after peers in the House of Lords cited the record level of prison suicides so far this year. Justice ministers responded by acknowledging the seriousness of the crisis and highlighting their plans to recruit 2,500 more prison officers, including 400 immediately for the 10 most challenged prisons.

Hindley in Greater Manchester opened in 1961 as a borstal and in 2015 was converted from a youth jail into a category C prison for young offenders and adult males serving sentences of up to four years.

The inspection was carried out in July, when the jail held 515 inmates and was within its operational capacity.

But the inspectors found a “totally inadequate regime” in which more than two-thirds of prisoners said they received less than six hours a day out of their cells and many experienced less than that on a daily basis.

“The inadequate regime was made worse by significant slippage and regular shutdowns, which meant that most prisoners regularly experienced being locked in their cells for more than 24 hours. As a result, prisoners were often not unlocked to attend work or education, and were denied daily access to showers and telephones,” the report said.



Residential wings and landings were dirty, with inspectors finding mould and fungus, while single cells were small and poorly ventilated, and many were filthy.

“The regime at Hindley was one of the worst, and possibly the very worst, that inspectors had ever seen in this type of prison,” said Clarke. “The length of time for which young adults and adults alike were locked up was, in our considered view, unnecessary, unjustifiable and counterproductive. Almost every aspect of prison life was adversely affected by the regime.”

He cited the problem of the staff association opposing a move to put microwaves on the wings as “symptomatic of what seemed to have gone wrong at Hindley”. He said many prisoners locked up all day only received a hot meal at 4pm and were given an inadequate breakfast pack to see them through to lunchtime the next day. A move to install microwaves would have been an improvement but “good intentions were not being translated into action on the wings”.

He added: “To make progress, there needs to be a very clear recognition of what is good at Hindley, and also where there needs to be fundamental change. Many examples of good practice could be found in the chaplaincy, education and healthcare. The same could not be said for residential areas. There needs to be an honest appraisal of the culture that predominates among some staff in these areas.”



Michael Spurr, the chief executive of the National Offender Management Service, said since the inspection a detailed improvement plan had been developed to address the weaknesses identified by inspectors.

“Progress has been made to improve safety and purposeful activity with more prisoners engaged in high-quality work and training opportunities,” said Spurr.



“Additional staff have been transferred into the prison to support the improvements required and the governor is working closely with Greater Manchester police to tackle gang behaviour and violence in the prison.”

For the past four months, Turkey’s leader has subjected his country to sweeping political purges – but there are few signs of an end soon. The new announcement that 6,000 teachers will be reinstated in their jobs after having been suspended is a welcome gesture but does little to reduce the level of tension.

Since the mid-July failed coup attempt against Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s regime, the president has orchestrated what amounts to a counter-coup. What Mr Erdoğan sees as a clean-up of the Turkish body politic looks like the biggest purge in Turkey’s modern history. More than 125,000 people have been dismissed or suspended and around 40,000 others arrested. Amnesty says there are “credible reports” of detainees being subjected to “beatings and torture, including rape”. Judges, military personnel and professors have lost their jobs.

While democracy should not have been usurped by the military, there are justifiable concerns about where Mr Erdoğan is going. A state of emergency allows him to rule by decree. Those affected are opponents of the ruling AK party. Kurdish activist groups and people suspected of links to the Fetullah Gülen network find themselves bracketed with Isis militants. Media freedom has been dramatically crushed. On 12 November the executive director of the pro-democracy newspaper Cumhuriyet was detained. Nine of its journalists had already been arrested.

Turkey’s western allies are alarmed, but against a complex geopolitical backdrop, they have chosen discretion rather than valour. After the EU parliament last week voted to freeze EU accession talks with Turkey, Mr Erdoğan lashed out by threatening to open the country’s borders to migrants heading to Europe. This is tantamount to blackmail. If the president made good it would collapse the EU-Turkey deal negotiated by Angela Merkel which saw Ankara agree to take back refugees in exchange for billions in aid, ease travel restrictions for Turks and refresh EU membership talks. The hope in European capitals is that Mr Erdoğan will not want to destroy the agreement: visa-free travel to Europe remains a popular prospect for Turks.

By fanning nationalist sentiment, Mr Erdoğan wants to reach his long-held goal of changing the Turkish constitution in a way that would enlarge and concentrate powers in the presidency. One proposal would see Mr Erdogan in office until 2029. But both the EU and Turkey’s strongman appear to suffer from a bout of magical thinking. There is currently no consensus in Europe for further rapprochement with a regime whose authoritarianism is blatantly on the rise. Nor is Mr Erdoğan ready to abandon the leverage he publicly claims to have with European governments. The lifting of visas hinges on Turkey rescinding the anti-terrorism legislation, which Mr Erdoğan uses to repress dissent – and he shows no appetite of giving up. An October deadline came and went, with no progress whatsoever.

No one, whether in Brussels or Ankara, is ready to cut off talks. The stalemate plays to both sides’ interests. This might change if Mr Erdoğan reintroduces the death penalty, as he has threatened to: the EU has said this would end accession talks. Meanwhile, the grinding machine of political repression continues in Turkey, whose rapprochement with Vladimir Putin’s Russia has become a stark new feature of its foreign policy – with western allies left to contemplate their lack of sway.

Harsh personal attacks on judges are bad for democracy and in danger of diminishing the independence of the judiciary, the former deputy president of the supreme court has warned.

In a forceful defence of the court’s justices ahead of next week’s pivotal article 50 appeal hearing, Lord Hope, who retired in 2013, said recent attacks had gone far beyond legitimate criticism. 



He revealed that a scheduled speech about the law and Europe by a supreme justice, Lord Mance, had to be cancelled because of heightened political sensitivity over the European Union and Brexit.



His comments come in the wake of a Daily Mail front page that branded the three high court judges who decided the article 50 case “enemies of the people” and media attacks on the supreme court president, Lord Neuberger, and the deputy president, Lady Hale.

“Things have been happening which have made the lives of those wishing to come into the judiciary much less [free],” Hope told a meeting hosted by the centre right thinktank Policy Exchange. “We run the risk of a diminished judiciary as a result. Recently the criticism has been taken too far and [there have been] harsh personal attacks.”

Hope said he had suffered from “wounding” personal attacks in the past. “It’s bad for democracy,” he added. “Every lecture given by members of the supreme court and [even] sentences are being taken out of context.

“Supreme court judges do give and publish lectures as part of their public [role]. This [excessive criticism] runs the risk of closing things down. At least one lecture [Lord Mance’s] was taken out in case it excites that sort of comment.”



The supreme court will next week hear the appeal by the government against the high court ruling that only parliament, as opposed to ministers, has the authority to trigger article 50 of the treaty on the European Union, which will formally start the UK’s withdrawal from the EU. 



In recognition of the unprecedented case’s constitutional importance, 11 supreme court justices will hear the arguments.



Addressing the Policy Exchange meeting, the former editor of the Daily Telegraph, Charles Moore, called on Neuberger and Hale to “recuse” themselves and stand down from the bench because of their alleged impartiality.

He accused Hale of giving a detailed speech on the issues in the article 50 case before hearing it and of introducing new questions about potential parliamentary procedure which had not been discussed in the high court case. Moore also said pro-European tweets by Neuberger’s wife constituted political activity.

Judges, Moore said, were traditionally considered to be the guardians of the constitution and the “lions under the throne”. Have they now become “snakes in the grass?”, he asked.

“The great majority of judges are very pro-human rights and pro-Europe,” he added. “Is there enough diversity of opinion on the supreme court? They should be independent of one another or is it group think?” 



The former home secretary and Conservative party leader, Michael Howard, accused Hale of “getting her retaliation in first” by delivering a speech ahead of the case. “It was wholly undesirable,” he said.

Although the Brexit case was not an example of judicial overreach, Lord Howard said there was evidence of a “judicial grab for power”. Since judges are “unaccountable” it would be “monstrous” if criticism of the judiciary were to be curtailed. “It’s of the utmost importance that the judiciary should not be immune from robust criticism,” he said.

Responding to attacks on the justices, a supreme court spokesperson said: “The role of the justices is to consider the points of law presented to them impartially, and to fulfil their judicial oath in reaching a decision according to the law. No evidence has been presented that would suggest any justice of the supreme court has compromised their ability to fulfil that duty.”

In statements earlier this month, the court defended Neuberger and Hale. A court spokesperson said: “Justices’ spouses are fully entitled to express personal opinions, including on issues of the day. Lady Neuberger’s passing comments on Twitter have absolutely no bearing on Lord Neuberger’s ability to determine the legal questions in this case impartially, according to the law of the land.”

In relation to Hale’s speech, a supreme court spokesperson said: “Lady Hale was simply presenting the arguments from both sides of the article 50 appeal in an impartial way for an audience of law students, as part of a wider lecture on constitutional law. It is entirely proper for serving judges to set out the arguments in high-profile cases to help public understanding of the legal issues, as long as it is done in an even-handed way.

“One of the questions raised in these proceedings is what form of legislation would be necessary for parliament to be able to lawfully trigger article 50, if the government loses its appeal. A number of politicians have raised the same question. Though it was not dealt with explicitly in the high court judgment, it is not a new issue. In no way was Lady Hale offering a view on what the likely outcome might be.”

The British government is facing a new legal challenge over whether it should seek to retain membership of the single market during the Brexit process. 



Lawyers will argue that June’s referendum asked the public a single question over whether the UK should leave the EU, and did not delve into the more complex issue of economic access.

The group British Influence will use a judicial review to suggest the government could be acting unlawfully if it uses Brexit to also leave the wider European Economic Area – through which non-EU countries such as Norway are inside the single market.

It is the second legal challenge faced by ministers over the process of leaving the EU. The government’s appeal to the recent high court ruling that only parliament has the power to formally trigger Brexit will be heard next week.

Jonathan Lis, the deputy director of British Influence, said: “The single market wasn’t on the ballot paper. To leave it would be devastating for the economy, smash our free trading arrangement and put thousands of jobs at risk. Why should people not only throw the baby out with the bath water, but the bath out of the window?”

His group will claim that Croatia provides an example of a country joining the EU and EEA separately, so identifying them as discrete groupings, and will cite research by senior academics on the issue.

“This is not an anti-Brexit measure,” he added.

But the government made clear it did not believe any attempt at a legal challenge would be successful, with Theresa May’s official spokeswoman insisting that Brexit meant leaving both organisations.

“Our position is clear, which is that the UK is only party to the EEA agreement in its capacity as an EU member state and once we leave the European Union we will automatically cease to be a member of the EEA – that is the legal framework,” she said.

A leading authority on European law also poured cold water on the idea. Jean-Claude Piris, a former head of the European council’s legal service, who served as official legal counsel on EU treaties, including Maastricht, Nice and Lisbon, said after Brexit the UK would not remain in the EEA.
