bangladeshi garment workers are neither mysterious nor in need of saving journalists and consumer organisations should call up the ngwf offices in dhaka and get the organisation 's opinion on the bangladeshi garment industry on tuesday no one other than i had contacted the ngwf about the primark labels their opinion is that poor pay and conditions are not unique to one brand \( primark \) but rather applicable to almost all the brands that are sourcing from bangladesh,0.0
the ngwf is also clear that it does not want to see the destruction of the industry through consumer boycotts as there are no other job opportunities for the four million women working in those factories,0.0
"they do however want people to work with them to pressure corporations into raising pay and conditions people in the uk should ask brands like primark , marks spencer , edinburgh woollen mill , or new look about the reality of their supply chain , says amin they should pressure brands to disclose their suppliers and to sign the bangladesh accord , and to ensure a fair price of bangladeshi garments and pay a living wage to garment workers",0.0
pressure groups like war on want and labour behind the label are helping workers but other consumer groups should also contact ngwf to discuss how they could help,0.0
"in the 1990 's , to guard against patronising or victimising garment workers , the united students against sweatshops \( usas \) adopted as its motto a few lines taken from lilla watson of the aboriginal activists group in queensland , australia in the 1970 's if you have come to help me you are wasting your time but if you 've come because your liberation is bound up with mine , then let us work together",0.0
progressive change in bangladesh depends on millions of young women taking on some of the world 's most repressive institutions and corporations they are already engaged in this fight and we can work with them what we must not do is silence their agency and their role in history by reducing them to a passive cry for help,0.0

"we had no set plan to go into the fashion world we both studied fine art at chelsea so making jewellery felt a bit like a continuation of the practice we had started there i used to sneakily read vogue for fun when i was meant to be reading kant after duchamp and the like we did n't have a plan , we thought we might do jewellery for a year , then make zines , then be in a band , and then whatever else we could dream up we had so much momentum at the start we just crashed into the fashion world head first",0.0

"but two months after the anniversary of the rana plaza factory collapse in bangladesh , when most of those injured and bereaved by the disaster are still waiting for compensation though primark , unlike other retailers who have admitted to a presence in the factory , has contributed to the compensation fund the secret message hidden inside a piece of women 's clothing is a startling image could a garment worker somewhere in the developing world really reach across the heads of managers , unions , manufacturers , governments , western multinationals and shopfloors into the wardrobe of an ordinary shopper , to make a complaint \? and if so , what do they want us to do about it \?",0.0
"improve their working conditions , is the obvious answer but how \? one anonymous senior executive from a big high street retailer recently told the guardian that shoppers do n't care about conditions , and research shows most prefer inexpensive over respect for human rights if consumers were more bothered about workers , goes this argument , the industry would progress",0.0
"campaigners , including the designer katharine hamnett , call this a cop out differences between retailers are proof that they , too , drive change european brands have gone further than those in the us in their support for bangladeshi trade unions in the aftermath of the rana plaza catastrophe , though matalan and benetton have yet to make any contribution to the compensation fund despite admitting links with the factory",0.0
"but it is true that the rise of ethical shopping , or what us sociologist juliet schor calls conscious consumption , has made limited headway in fashion it is possible to choose free range over factory produced eggs even in convenience stores much harder to opt to pay a premium of a couple of pounds for a t shirt that comes with ethical plus points",0.0
"in part this is down to the sheer complexity of the fashion supply chain perhaps the most poignant and ironic thing about the message in a primark dress , is that as far away as the machine operators in the stitch and sew factories of bangladesh and elsewhere might appear , they are far closer to us than most of the other millions of people involved in making our clothes",0.0
"thanks in part to the publicity surrounding the rana plaza disaster , we can at least imagine the men and women who sew them but before a cotton dress is cut and stitched it is dyed and printed before that it is woven from yarn into cloth before that it is spun from raw cotton into yarn and before that it is planted , picked , and ginned \( or cleaned \) cotton is an agricultural commodity and the world 's most important non food crop , grown on all five continents and by some of the poorest people in the world",0.0

"the map does n't need dots , explains kamani we 're going to get everywhere for many years boohoo had been quietly going about its business in a rundown former mill but the kamani family sacrificed anonymity in march when they pressed the button on a stock market listing that earned them a fortune and a large amount of scrutiny from potential investors",0.0
"the retailer has an impressive track record , having gone from a standing start in 2007 to profits of nearly 11m from sales of 110m in the year to the end of february it has just completed the first of several phases of expansion planned for its burnley warehouses , which will eventually be able to handle sales of 1bn so far so asos , the fast growing fashion website , which until recently was a stock market darling",0.0
"after running a private business for decades , becoming a stock market pawn can be a shock for entrepreneurs used to doing what they think is best kamani is a refreshingly straight talker and reportedly told analysts at a recent meeting that boohoo 's mobile website was shit he is coy when asked about it and his pr offers that it is being upgraded",0.0
"the listing has been a baptism of fire for the senior team , including kamani 's brother jalal , who is trading director after debuting at 50p the shares soared to 85p but are now back just below the offer price",0.0

indeed kamani labours the point that boohoo is not an overnight success but the culmination of decades of graft this is not an eight year story this is a family business that 's been going for 30 years,0.0

kamani appears to have inherited his father 's work ethic and is either on the phone or looking at messages on one of his two handsets when the conversation lulls he is momentarily distracted by an email and elbows kane it turns out that the latest sales figures have come through and he is surprised how good they are she quickly explains that a promotion has just kicked in,0.0

"unusually boohoo buys very small quantities of stock , 300 500 pieces at a time , with one in four orders then repeated because this is an e commerce business you 've got to be fresh all the time , says kane a traditional retailer might buy three or four styles but we 'll buy 25 that way we 've covered off the overall volume required and the one that really works we 'll get back into",0.0

"the other day , i woke up to find several sexually explicit photos of myself in my inbox some of them showed me doing things i 'd already written about in the widely quoted account of my encounter with photographer terry richardson at age 19 others showed me doing things of which i had and have no memory at all my body language is stiff , but a close reading of my face reveals nothing , even to me the lights are on , but no one 's home",0.0

"please let me know if it is indeed you , and if so , whether you think it 's two occasions and you forgot , or what , new york magazine reporter benjamin wallace wrote in the email",0.0
"this was not entirely unexpected a little while before that , i came across a photo of richardson reaching out to grab my breast it jogged a vague memory of uncle terry groping me without asking something i was always terrified would happen when i was modeling for guys with cameras but which i did n't precisely recall happening in the shoot i wrote about it made me wonder what else i was n't remembering",0.0
"it was not a very good feeling to have , least of all when i 'd already spoken at length about my experience in the belief that i was telling the absolute truth i worried what conclusions wallace would draw for his readers my conclusions would , i figured , be somewhat different trauma particularly sexual trauma affects memory , often in ways that allow predators to traumatize their victims while simultaneously rendering them unreliable witnesses to their own lives",0.0
"on monday morning , instead of pictures , i woke up to wallace 's cover story , is terry richardson an artist or a predator \? is that supposed to be a trick question \?",0.0
"from roman polanski to woody allen and thousands of nice guys in between , it should be obvious by now that artists and predators are n't mutually exclusive sexual predators are n't drooling monsters that hide in caves they are husbands , fathers , employees , friends and , yes , sometimes artists why is this so hard for some people to understand \?",0.0
"but figuring the headline might have been written by an editor looking to titillate , i read on",0.0
"in more than 7 , 000 words , the false dichotomy of the headline is never directly addressed despite all the words the article spends illuminating richardson 's glamorous but messed up childhood , his nepotistic career arc and what various people think of his provocative work call me crazy , but allegations of sexual harassment and abuse are a little more important than what type of sandwich uncle terry likes to eat in the morning",0.0
"it treats the central question of richardson 's many critics was meaningful consent given for the sex acts in these images \? in a cursory fashion , given that it 's the theme this major magazine article promises to explore it is n't as though the author lacked for material wallace and i spoke for over an hour , and the only quote he used from me was in regard to the aforementioned images",0.0
"stories from other people were treated similarly brief points about their accusations accompanied by parenthetical denials from richardson 's camp charlotte waters 's story of assault was mentioned , but accompanied by the mitigating mention that she referred to herself as a pervert in an introductory email almost as though that was a green light for whatever sena cech released a statement about how her story was mischaracterized by wallace",0.0
"as someone morbidly interested in the psychology of criminals and sociopaths as well as the banal ways abuse weaves itself into our lives from generation to generation i 'll admit that i was able to dissociate myself enough to find the new york magazine story an enthralling read in much the same way that i devoured the book devil in the white city or the killer eliot rodger 's lengthy manifesto it offers detailed , socially understandable explanations for richardson 's behavior his unconventional and even traumatic childhood his lack of empathy his seemingly limited understanding of how coercion works and all the people who enabled him to continue to operate",0.0
"there 's even some mention of the power structures that keep richardson insulated from the consequences of his actions , including the fact that agents send models to him and they feel , in the model sarah ziff 's words , pressured to comply because my agent had told me to make a good impression \( ziff , in the years since , co founded the labor organization model alliance to address the systemic problems that make young models vulnerable to both richardsons and an economically exploitative system \)",0.0
"wallace does a good job describing the if i'm being generous willful na vet that richardson exhibits about his own work but his pose is undermined by the apparently savvy way he chooses collaborators for his more explicit work kate moss was n't asked to grab a hard dick , said one anonymous photo agent the first real nod to false sense of choice with which richardson apparently presented his no name models",0.0
"but , even the moments of clarity about the exploitative nature of the system in which richardson has operated are surrounded by quotes from his yes men and women one of whom is his girlfriend , although that 's not mentioned sounding as defensive and delusional as you 'd expect",0.0

"the \( possibly \) desperate part lies in the fact that such certainty tends to require a discount one suspects aviva , blackrock , glg , lansdowne and the other cornerstone investing institutions have done their homework the aa is tricky to value because it is towing 3bn of debt but it is a highly cash generative business it is the biggest operator in a market where size brings clear advantages and profit margins on the main roadside assistance business were close to 50 at the trading level last year",0.0

"as for help to buy , george osborne 's much maligned scheme , it is probably not the greatest culprit the data suggests very few homes in london are being bought with the help of government guarantees but perceptions matter and help to buy may be encouraging the foolish thought among stretched borrowers that london houses are always a one way bet as a first step , cut the maximum value of qualifying houses from 600 , 000 to 300 , 000 then phase out help to buy altogether",0.0

"the barnsley based firm , operating off a sterling cost base and a sterling pricing structure , has been forced to discount heavily to compete in countries with weaker currencies russia , for example what 's more , when surplus stock is cleared in the uk , where sales are subject to vat , the trade carries lower profit margins",0.0
"in the scheme of things , this is merely a serious setback for asos rather than a catastrophe the introduction of so called zonal pricing may help in time but the manner in which the firm was dragged into heavy discounting ought to alarm investors maybe a steady profit margin of 6 5 is simply outside management 's control when you 're attempting to expand internationally at a rate of 30 a year",0.0

"the fashion industry is in a bad state fatal fires , building collapses , horror stories about environmental destruction and endemic exploitation so what can be done \? does data monitoring technology offer a solution to these problems \?",0.0
"for the past few decades , determining standards in factories has depended on corporations hiring third parties to carry out audits malcolm guy , founder of continuous data company supply link puts it bluntly corporate audits have failed indeed rana plaza had been audited twice and served with a clean bill of health by primark in pakistan in 2012 the ali enterprises factory fire killed 289 garment workers despite the factory having been recently inspected and certified by social accountability international",0.0
"instead of corporate audits , which can be falsified and quickly become out of date , guy argues that the fashion industry should be aiming for a constant stream of data providing a clear image of what is happening in factories",0.0
"continuous data also known as live data involves collecting information that can be used to monitor energy use , water and waste management , carbon production , and building health and safety the idea is that constantly collecting data ensures it is timely , accurate , and unhampered in china continuous data about smog and pollution is recorded and made public",0.0
"schemes can also involve monitoring people continuous data can answer questions like what is the staff turnover at a factory \? how many hours are staff working \? how efficient are they \? with regards to health and safety , during a recent guardian live chat amisha ghadiali , co founder of provenance , described the option of brands using heat maps to detect overcrowding there is also the option of installing cameras in factories to monitor working conditions",0.0

"a data management consultant in london , who asked to remain anonymous , outlined some of the problems there is this constant idea that more is better while there is not necessarily anything wrong with collecting vast amounts of data , you have to make sure there are protections in place to ensure privacy this is not scaremongering , when it comes to protecting vulnerable people you ca n't just give their data away",0.0
"in light of data collection revelations around the nsa in the united states and gchq in the uk , data collection is an inflammatory topic once it 's privatised , data can be used to target you in a way you do n't want to be targeted , she continues companies and governments can start profiling you , and your privacy and rights can be seriously compromised",0.0

"it turns out that fast fashion brands have n't just enjoyed a lucky escape in the form of business as usual but in many cases have been rewarded by spectacular growth the garment and textile industry , worth more than 3tn per year and producing around 80bn new garments a year whether we need them or not is booming and fast fashion is booming the most",0.0
"fast fashion is the merchandising phenomenon that has built up steam over the past 15 years and now dominates our wardrobes and high streets it ripped up the traditional fashion calendar \( the period from conceptualising a piece to delivery into store \) and pulverised lead times famously it was inditex owned zara that really broke the mould , bringing in a super responsive timetable in the form of some 12 , 000 new styles each year it is now every brand 's goal to be as quick and cheap as zara",0.0
"this means that outsourcing hotspots like bangladesh now second only to china in the cut , make and trim \( cmt \) clothes making process with a surplus of cheap \( mainly female \) labour , is now engaged in produced fashion when at best it has capacity for basic garments with longer lead times the pressure is extraordinary and is shouldered by the most vulnerable and exploited in the chain garment workers such as those in rana plaza sent back into a collapsing building to finish an urgent order",0.0
"despite the environmental footprint \( from cotton production to dyeing and spinning and finishing a single garment \) and the human capital , clothes are made and sold as perishable goods generation y ers have never known anything else it 's not surprising top retailers advise their design teams that mid priced clothing only has a lifespan of five weeks in the average wardrobe that makes 4 t shirts and 10 jeans disposable",0.0
"the markets love this business model , which is precisely why fast fashion is winning investors and analysts are appreciative of its transformation from a slightly bumbling industry two decades ago , characterised by slow growth and over capacity , to a lean fighting machine where the top brands are hyper aggressive and expanding like mad the revenues of h m , inditex and fast retailing \( owner of uniqlo \) are all expected to surge , in the months ahead but the real star is primark not six months after producing at rana plaza on that ill fated day , its figures were described by city analysts as remarkable",0.0
"the coffers of fast fashion brands do not swell by themselves , of course in the hours after rana plaza , global activists were dissuaded \( rightly , i still think \) from a boycott of the brands associated with those kinds of factories boycotts are out of fashion because they hurt the very people that they are designed to help in this case some 4 million members of the cmt army that are dependent on fast fashion production in bangladesh as analyst dr maximilian martin puts it in his recent report on the industry , creating sustainable apparel value chains arguments that consumers should shop less are voiced every once in a while , but evidence shows that consumption will not decelerate , absent a major war occurring i honestly think that such is our addiction to fast fashion that many of us would put on a flak jacket and run the risk",0.0
"weirdly , it remains heretical to suggest we should pay more for clothes or that the fast fashion brands have a case to answer the industry carries a number of get out of jail free cards , but one of the most effective has been the idea that these brands democratise fashion , bringing the consumer unparallelled value we 've fallen for this hook , line and sinker honestly , from some of the rhetoric , you 'd think that some fashion retailers were running food banks not flogging millions of units of disposable clothes closely allied to this is the idea that they are all about development and opportunity , facilitating an industrial revolution in bangladesh and other developing economies and although bangladesh has all its eggs , and gdp , in the ready made garment industry basket , we need to assess carefully real worker opportunities besides , if development really were at the heart of proceedings , the brands would act very differently",0.0

"no one is entirely sure how big the global clothing industry is , what profit it makes or how many it employs it is estimated that 300bn worth of clothes were made by the top 10 producers in 2012 , and the industry as a whole generates revenues of between 500m and 2tn but no one really knows",0.0
"textiles , if not garments , have always been a key element of global commerce for more than a thousand years , trade between europe and east asia travelled what were known as the silk routes later , the textile industry played an important role in britain 's emergence as the world 's leading commercial power there and elsewhere , the rag trade employed millions and created immense wealth , playing a key role in the transition of western nations from agrarian to industrial economies but nothing really compares with what is happening today , either in scale or in impact for as the west has got richer , its demand for clothes has steadily risen",0.0
"garment making is labour intensive and there is often little room for savings on the textiles that are the biggest single cost this means the price of a human being cutting , making and trimming a garment is key in the overall production costs and , of course , eventual profits through the 50s and 60s , producers hunted cheaper labour in east asia first japan and then , in the 70s and 80s , in the so called asian tiger economies of hong kong , singapore , south korea and taiwan employment in the garment manufacturing industry in the west has declined steadily decade on decade despite attempts to protect local industries with quota systems and tariffs production in newly industrialised china , as well as in indonesia , turkey , mexico and india , has increased exponentially",0.0
"for the consumer , of course , this has all meant that while prices of everything else except communications have risen , clothes cost less in 1900 , 15 of a us household 's income was spent on clothing in 1950 , it was still 12 even as late as the early 1990s , major purchases of clothing a suit , a dress , a coat marked a special occasion or a rite of passage but by 2004 , the total amount spent by households on clothes had dropped to just 4 by 2010 , according to the us bureau of labour statistics , clothing cost the average american family only 1 , 700 \( 1 , 017 \) , 2 8 of their income and for that money the consumer gets much more cheap no longer means nasty it just means affordable in 1997 , the average woman in the uk bought 19 items of clothing a year in 2007 , she bought 34",0.0
"the big bang in recent textile history came in a few short years at the beginning of the last decade , when various factors coincided to change radically the nature and scale of garment production around the planet one was the end of the quota system put in place 30 years earlier to protect western industries a second was a new degree of conformity of tastes across the world , allowing greater uniformity of product and bigger volumes of single designs a third was fast fashion",0.0
"fast fashion is at once a mode of production , a strategy and a style it grew out of the efforts of the major western brands , which dominate garment sales , to find new ways to coax further demand out of a saturated market though soon adopted by retailers across the world , it was pioneered by inditex , the giant spanish company that owns zara it depends on a series of mutually reinforcing innovations an accelerated cycle of design , production and supply that means trends can be spotted , copied and sold within weeks no seasons , but a year round product flow low stock levels in stores to encourage rapid , repeated impulse purchases a supply chain that can respond when shop staff notice that shoppers suddenly seem to like lace , or blue , or diamond patterns , or a particular stitching on their socks , or whatever huge numbers of young adults for whom shopping is the primary leisure activity a new obsession with celebrities , fuelled by social media and the internet and , of course , low prices",0.0
"sourcing has thus become a complex operation in which scores of different factors cost , location , eventual market , risk , competition , styling , quality and so on are computed to decide on an eventual place of production basic clothing socks , for example will be ordered in huge quantities with long lead times higher quality workmanship will be done in europe , north africa or , for the us market , latin america more fashion led items are often needed in smaller quantities but faster and cost , whatever the brands say , is always the prime consideration so in this highly networked system , places where suppliers can turn around vast quantities of clothing very rapidly and very cheaply are key places where you can order , say , 500 , 000 basic shirts , paying 6 per piece , and they will be shipped on time , with minimum fuss , and be in stores , retailing for 30 , within , at the outside , two to three months places such as bangladesh",0.0

"if an order is delivered late , accepted practice in much of the industry is for the buyer to deduct 5 for each week of delay the buyers already have political unrest , wildcat strikes and blockades to deal with they cannot afford to risk losing further days of production",1.0
and that is what they are facing now,0.0
"which may explain how , somehow , overnight , the cracks that shut the factory the day before have become less dangerous and the management has called in the workforce the building has been inspected once more and is safe , they say monthly salaries are due in 10 days , but overtime , which increases most employees' salaries by between a third and a half , and means being able to pay the rent or eat properly , will be paid in the next day or so many of the workers are told by their managers that unless they work , they will not receive the money what choice have we got , the workers are saying to each other we are here to work , after all",0.0
"the managers know this they know , too , that , as a female supervisor , shapla is trusted more than her male counterparts , and not just by her girls so when they want the workers to stop shouting and calm down , and to enter the building , take their places at their machines and finish the big orders the factories are currently under pressure to complete on time , several come to her , telling her again how the building is safe , how the girls trust her , how if she does n't go in , the girls wo n't either she is uncertain , reluctant , but because at that moment it is the easiest thing to do , she gives way and goes in and her girls follow",0.0
"similar pressure has been put on other supervisors they , too , reluctantly head into the building soon all the workers are flowing up the stairs mahmuda leaves her husband in the stairwell he carries on up to his factory she makes her way to her desk and machine on the third floor on the fifth floor , in the ether tex factory , 15 year old preity , her mother and her sister are working by 8 30am preity is on her feet , moving up and down the line , clearing offcuts , bringing new needles or thread her mother is nearby , her sister working at a sewing machine on the same line but at the opposite end of the room",0.0
"mahmuda has time to stitch maybe two or three pieces before the lights go out , the old fans , which barely dent the heat in the factory , slow and the sewing machines stop a power cut , frequent enough and no cause for alarm the workers wait in the gloom , talking quietly , worried , waiting for the powerful , heavy generators installed on the roof to start up",0.0
"moments after the generators start , sending vibrations through the building , a pillar in one corner of the rana plaza gives way with a loud , explosive bang then each storey slides sideways , tips and splits , falling in on the one below on the third floor , the collapse is almost instantaneous , but the workers of phantom apparels still have time to realise what is happening",0.0
"the floor starts shaking and it is clear the building is coming down mahmuda starts reciting verses of the qur'an she staggers , falls and crawls beneath her sewing machine",0.0
"shapla is walking down her line when the building starts to collapse she starts running she , too , seeks protection under a sewing machine and then everything gives way around her she is in darkness , gasping for breath",0.0
"two floors above , the floor inclines slowly like the deck of a sinking ship panicked workers rush to the two narrow exits it is dark , there is much dust and noise runarini has managed to find her youngest daughter , preity , and is now trying to get to the other end of her line where shamapati , her eldest , was working at her machine but the force of bodies pushes her towards the exit she cannot hold on to preity and fight the crowd to find shamapati the floor lurches , tips again and everything falls",0.0
"in the darkness after the collapse there are many voices sobs , sustained screaming , calls for help and water , moans of pain , prayers , howls of grief some are trapped in total darkness , others can make out some light many are pinned down by huge blocks of concrete , bent iron girders , machinery others are entombed in small cavities some are alone , others with colleagues or strangers from other floors shapla can move her hand but nothing else mahmuda can see the sky through a gap in the wall several yards away runarini and preity are trapped together and they can hear voices , but not shamapati 's they shout her name , but there is no response",0.0
"outside there is chaos dazed survivors stand immobile in a huge , roiling cloud of dust it takes time for dhaka 's ramshackle emergency services to arrive , so hundreds of locals clamber over and through the rubble , tearing at the concrete blocks and mangled metal with their hands soon corpses are lined up on the ground , limbs limp and twisted , as if they had fallen from a great height mahmuda crawls towards the light , finds herself only a few metres from the ground and clambers down she cannot see her husband",0.0
shapla waits longer for rescue she can hear sirens and shouts outside they are hammering and drilling the slab of concrete above her she finds her throat so dry from screaming that she cannot talk when the rescuers find her she is unaware that she has made any noise whatsoever it takes two hours to free her,3.0
"runarini and preity crawl together towards a shaft of light and are lifted from the rubble by mid afternoon the ruined building is now surrounded by police and soldiers , and heavy lifting equipment is arriving there are electric saws and jackhammers , and lines of ambulances there is no sign of shamapati",0.0
"bangladesh is the original basket case , a term coined by henry kissinger , the us secretary of state , to describe the country immediately after its violent secession from pakistan in 1971 up to 3 million died in that conflict , a civil war that was simultaneously a war of independence , and its wounds remain livid famine , flood , a massive programme of nationalisation , political instability and further violence crippled the new nation 's economy but , despite the continual challenges , the textiles and garment industry prospered investment and advice from korean companies helped and , by the end of the 1990s , the industry had somehow weathered destructive storms political , economic and meteorological",0.0
"in 2004 , when the protectionist quotas that had been imposed to protect western jobs 30 years earlier expired , many in bangladesh were apprehensive but the industry boomed business just took off , says rubana huq , now managing director of garment manufacturers the mohammadi group in 2004 there were 2 million workers in bangladesh 's 4 , 000 factories , with exports worth 6bn nine years later , there were twice as many in 5 , 600 registered establishments , sending 21bn worth of clothes overseas",0.0
"competition from abroad when the quotas disappeared meant prices dipped , huq says , but the demand from europe and the us was so great that she and others just kept on building if wages in bangladesh remained the lowest in the world , land prices in central dhaka , where most of the garment businesses were based , rose so fast that new investors sought space on the margins of the city where hastily reclaimed wetlands could still be bought relatively cheaply in savar , gazipur , ashulia and elsewhere around dhaka , hundreds of factories went up every year there was little or no planning or regulation",0.0
"people were not much concerned by building codes or quality of material , admits emdadul islam , the long serving chief engineer of rajuk , dhaka 's development authority monitoring of environmental impact , construction quality and permits for the millions flowing in from rural areas were almost nonexistent",0.0
"inevitably , people started to die in april 2005 , a factory in savar called spectrum collapsed , killing 64 workers the dead were making clothes for western retailers poor cement was a likely cause builders often charge for better quality materials than they deliver or water from a nearby canal may have washed out foundations for a short period there was talk of a crackdown on unsafe buildings , but even though a second factory in northern dhaka collapsed a year later , killing 21 , the fuss faded as the recession hit western economies in 2008 and 2009 , brands forced down prices even further as they negotiated with suppliers those in bangladesh who demanded government intervention in one of the country 's few economic success stories made little headway when dozens of garment factory owners sat in parliament and powerful industry bodies had the ear of policymakers the boom continued bangladesh , the world 's 76th biggest exporter of clothes in 1980 , was the eighth biggest in 2006 , and by 2013 was second only to china",0.0
"over the decade , prompted by a string of reports of child labour and other abuses in factories around the world , the brands had set up systems to monitor pay and working conditions in their supply chain some organised their own inspections , many brought in contractors but executives did not think to undertake structural surveys of the buildings where their clothes were made instead , they relied on the corrupt , poorly paid , underqualified , undermanned local authorities this , senior executives at major european brands now admit , was a mistake others use stronger terms from 2005 to march 2013 , fires killed an estimated 600 , but no more buildings collapsed",0.0
"the dhaka suburb of gulshan is only 15 miles from savar rickshaws negotiate its quiet , tree lined streets with relative ease and there are many good restaurants in the late morning , coffee shops are busy with staff from international ngos and the un this is where the bangladesh operations of many big european and us brands are based , as are the larger buyers who often act as their intermediaries locally",0.0
"the offices of h m occupy a new five storey block there is nothing to distinguish the building , inside or out , from its counterparts in any western capital on the walls of brightly lit meeting rooms each named after garment manufacturing zones around the city are posters of laughing , thin , beautiful young europeans of varying ethnic backgrounds wearing the bright , cheery , fashionable clothes of the company 's brands a notice tells staff your passionate focus towards quality will make it happen",0.0
"h m , which has 3 , 000 stores in around 50 markets worldwide and sales of 13bn in 2012 \( making a profit of 1 6bn \) , has been in bangladesh since the early 80s and is one of the biggest foreign brands working in the country the swedish retailer did not have any contracts with the factories working in rana plaza , nor any link to the building , and has long been at the forefront of efforts to find a way to improve pay and working conditions in the industry these have intensified since last april 's tragedy , but there 's a lot more to the country for us than low wages and low costs , says anna gedda , the company 's social sustainability manager",0.0
"executives from other big brands all make similar points when talking about the rana plaza collapse , even if their companies have been less proactive than h m they express their shock and grief , say they have long recognised the problems in bangladesh , point out that the chaotic environment of a developing world city means many issues are partly beyond their control \( though , they admit , still their responsibility \) , and downplay the significance of cheap labour in the decision to locate production in the country they also emphasise the importance of the garment industry to the bangladeshi economy and the social transformation brought about by the employment of millions of young , rural women , albeit in poorly paid , monotonous jobs one company spokesman points out that otherwise these women would be in the fields , in ship breaking or shrimp farming , working as maids now , he says , they are breadwinners , independent , and often with the means to pay for their kids to go to school",0.0
"h m 's gedda says the best way for the country is for brands like h m to stay there this is something one hears frequently from the bangladesh garment manufacturers and exporters association , senior ministers , international trade unionists , independent economists and urban development specialists in dhaka it 's also what all the workers say everyone agrees that the rana plaza collapse was a wake up call that will be a turning point , but they all say the industry and the brands must remain if there is a pull out , it will be a catastrophe for dhaka , says professor nazrul islam , of the local centre for urban studies",0.0
"the result , after a series of fairly acrimonious meetings in geneva and paris last year , is three separate initiatives the accord , which involves more than 150 largely european brands the alliance , set up by us brands and a joint effort by the un and the bangladeshi government between them , these three are meant to bring all the factories in bangladesh into a system of auditing and inspection that will enforce agreed standards they will also , theoretically , ensure structural surveys the brands will help pay for improvements needed by their suppliers to meet the new standards through grants in the case of the legally binding accord and soft loans for the less constraining alliance and there are also provisions for strengthening the country 's underdeveloped and highly politicised unions there is a separate process designed to establish how much compensation will be paid the total could be more than 40m to the rana plaza victims many brands have refused to become involved and international trade unionists admit the current initiatives have many flaws nonetheless , they say , taken together the package represents an unprecedented chance to put all this right",0.0
"some specialists even hope that initiatives will provide a model not just in bangladesh but in cambodia , indonesia , latin america and even the emerging new markets for production such as burma and ethiopia the risk , of course , is that attention will fade , as it did after the 2005 spectrum factory collapse this is plan b , says srinivas reddy , the bangladesh country director of the international labour organisation plan a led to rana plaza there is no plan c",0.0
"if , from afar , the world of the garment workers and the garment industry in bangladesh is one of stark contrasts , up close it is one of shadows and ambiguity mohammadpur , for example , is a designated slum that is also a booming new neighbourhood on the western margins of a city that has no legal boundaries a few decades ago it was wetland like savar or gazipur by the 90s , the marshes had been replaced by rows of wooden sheds on stilts full of half starved labourers and their families now it is changing again as dhaka , a city of at least 15 million , gets steadily less poor the wooden shacks have been replaced by cement apartments and rooms there are tea stalls with tvs tuned to the discovery channel , schools , shops and a refurbished mosque it 's better than where i came from at least there 's a chance of making a living here , of a better life , perhaps , says salahuddin , a 27 year old labourer who fled poverty , debt and failing yields on a tiny parcel of land to bring his family to the city",0.0
"but if it is possible to see incremental and uneven progress in dhaka , there is also misery , overcrowding , disease , crime and failing infrastructure police rarely venture into mohammadpur a fire in a garment factory here killed seven in 2013 and fear of such accidents is one reason salahuddin 's wife , juleika , prefers poorly paid work as a maid the dirt roads are strewn with rubbish water from standpipes is sold at extortionate prices by landlords in league with local politicians and bureaucrats there is the perpetual risk of eviction and demolition in the brutal summer heat , the concrete boxes where entire families live are furnaces",0.0
"then there is bangladesh it is one of the next 11 nations seen by goldman sachs as having the potential to take off as major economies its development indicators have risen steadily , to the point where most are now better than those in neighbouring india but again , if the rate of population growth has dropped in recent years , it is still high flooding and extreme weather events linked to climate change threaten disasters in the future in this low lying land the flow from the countryside to the cities is unlikely to slow soon , and , as the effluent from the factories contaminates the once pristine waterways , so toxic politics and endemic graft poison public life",0.0
"and what of the garment industry 's role in all of this \? along with remittances from workers overseas , the industry is the only major foreign currency earner for the country wages for workers have risen since the disaster the minimum monthly salary for an entry level worker is now 5 , 300bdt \( about 40 \) a month but so have rents , and no one can pretend a family can live on a single salary factory conditions might have improved in the last decade , but even without the 1 , 130 who died in rana plaza , the toll from fires and other accidents would be intolerable along with the 4 million directly employed by the industry , economists say there are another 4 million people whose livelihoods depend on the internal demand it generates if half of these 8 million people support a family of five , then around a sixth of the population depends on people several thousands miles away buying cheap clothes that they do n't need",0.0
"and that means this world of ambiguity is one the consumer inhabits , too many debate where the blame lies for tragedies such as rana plaza , and argue over who has the responsibility to prevent them in the future the owners of the factories \? those who let the buildings that house the workshops \? the crooked builders \? the bent bureaucrats \? the government \? the intermediaries who do so much of the buying \? the brands \?",0.0
"some western brands implicitly accept a degree of moral responsibility , even if their lawyers are careful to make sure their legal liability is strictly limited people portray companies as evil by definition , and in many aspects they are but often times a company is forced to behave in certain ways by consumer behaviour if no one buys your product , you are out of business consumers take decisions for companies , but often they do n't , which means they do n't care , says one senior executive at a big european high street brand",0.0
"though there is little statistical evidence of any direct correlation between bad publicity about social issues and sales it would , experts say , be almost impossible to establish such a link anyway big companies do their own research to understand the impact on sales of events such as the rana plaza collapse",0.0
"companies do very precise work on this to understand the consumers and what level of quality they are willing to pay for , and it shows that a large number of consumers prefer inexpensive over respect for human rights or environment , the executive says after all , if you buy a pair of jeans at 9 99 , what are you really expecting about the working conditions of those who made them or even just the environment in which they live \?",0.0

last month the regulator rather fortuitously announced it had put in place a safety net to guarantee that any customer who had built up a big credit balance with their supplier won t lose out,1.0
"domestic energy customers can often be hundreds of pounds in credit at this time of the year , ahead of the peak winter usage period when bills are much higher ofgem is looking to appoint a supplier that will in effect honour any credit that gb energy customers have built up in return for effectively scooping 160 , 000 customers",1.0
"this looks a tall order given the liability if half its customers were 300 in credit this equates to 24m if no supplier will take on the liability , then a levy will be placed on all suppliers to fund this sum , equal to around 1 a household",1.0
"affected gb energy customers who have not yet taken meter readings should do so ofgem will manage the transfer behind the scenes , and has confirmed that no customer will lose out as a result of this",1.0
"almost certainly the deal to which gb customers will be moved is unlikely to be one of the cheapest on the market most likely it will be on the chosen energy supplier s standard tariff , which typically cost around 1 , 100 a year for average consumption around 250 a year more than the cheapest deals out there",1.0
"there is nothing to stop customers then moving supplier from ofgem s chosen firm , but the advice is to wait until the last resort switch has taken place , particularly if you have a credit balance as you could lose that by switching directly now",1.0
i m with a small supplier is mine at risk \?,1.0
"it could be the challenger suppliers do well when wholesale prices fall , but struggle when the opposite happens the last supplier to go bust was energy4business , which collapsed in 2008 in the past few years wholesales prices have been on the side of the small suppliers , but over the past 12 months they have gone up around 50 , albeit from a very low base , and there will be some very nervous finance directors at a number of smaller suppliers this morning",1.0
"seasoned industry expert doug stewart , who runs supplier green energy uk , says he fears the collapse could be the first of many , if there is a harsh winter the closure of gb energy is as a result of loss making tariffs coming home to roost you can t make losses without having cash to cover them , and when that cash is coming from upfront payments made by customers , the whole pack of cards comes tumbling down when growth slows or stops there s nothing left in the bank to pay the creditors , and the customers money is all gone , he says",1.0
"technically there is no reason to avoid the challenger suppliers , as if yours goes bust , you as a consumer won t lose out that said , lots of switching households will be even less keen now to switch to a firm they have never heard of the cheapest current average dual fuel deals cost around 850 , but few buyers will have heard of the suppliers",1.0
"with the cheapest big six supplier tariffs now costing around 880 890 , many buyers will decide that the extra cost of moving to an established firm could be worth paying",1.0

"huge numbers of vat fraudsters are illegally selling goods tax free to british shoppers on amazon and ebay this christmas , despite new government efforts to crack down on this ballooning 1bn vat evasion crisis",1.0
"a guardian investigation found a wide variety of popular goods being illegally sold without vat on britain s leading shopping sites they range from cheap christmas tree lights , electric toothbrushes and thermal socks to expensive laptops , ipads , music keyboards , violins and pingpong tables",1.0
"in some cases , vat fraudsters offer unbeatable prices mostly , however , their prices remain in line with law abiding competitors and the proceeds of evasion disappear overseas , often to china",1.0
"guardian investigations found many tax evading sellers were trading without displaying vat numbers on amazon or ebay others were showing made up numbers , or numbers cloned , without authorisation , from unsuspecting legitimate businesses",1.0
"several sellers purported to be operating through uk trading companies , but checks showed these firms had been dissolved , sometimes years earlier none responded to questions about vat",1.0
"hmrc estimates the explosion in vat fraud on britain s shopping websites will cost 1bn to 1 5bn in lost vat revenues this year , with much of it going missing in the current festive period",1.0
"by the end of cyber monday uk shoppers will have spent 6 77bn on the web in a seven day shopping binge that peaked on black friday , according to online retail association imrg the number of parcels ordered online will be up 12 on last year , it estimates",1.0
"the market for many goods is now dominated by overseas sellers on ebay , for example , 40 of uk sales of android phones are to firms registered in china meanwhile , chinese based companies account for more than 60 of sales of christmas tree fairy lights on ebay co uk",1.0
"there is no suggestion that amazon or ebay have themselves evaded tax , but critics claim they could make some basic changes such as requiring sellers to display valid vat numbers that would help to stop their websites being used by many overseas companies as a platform for industrial scale fraud",1.0
"both ebay and amazon insist that it is not their responsibility to police tax compliance among sellers vat rules are complex but the tax generally applies to most goods supplied from locations in the uk even if the seller company is incorporated overseas shoppers typically see prices that include vat , charged on most goods at the standard rate of 20",1.0
"amazon told the guardian marketplace sellers are independent businesses responsible for complying with their own vat obligations it added that amazon does offer tools sellers can use to help with tax compliance , but we don t have the authority to review their tax affairs",1.0
ebay said it would pass information from the guardian s investigation to hmrc if we are informed by hmrc that a seller is not complying with requirements then we will take appropriate action a spokesperson said ebay continually reminds sellers of their need to comply with the law and had recently warned overseas firms of the uk government s efforts to deal with vat fraud,1.0
"after the guardian first highlighted rife vat evasion on online shopping sites , hmrc launched a series of warehouse raids , seizing 500 , 000 of goods months later , the then chancellor george osborne gave tax inspectors new powers which he said demonstrated firm action to protect the uk market from unfair online competition from overseas vat evaders",1.0
"under the new rules , hmrc now has the power to issue amazon and ebay with warning notices about suspected vat fraudsters using their sites if they then fail to take action , amazon and ebay can be held liable for any vat that later goes missing",1.0
"in reality , however , these changes have had little impact and vat evasion remains widespread a spokesperson for vatfraud org , a campaign group set up by uk based sellers , said despite the new laws , hmrc have shown a woeful lack of action there are many fraudsters who were reported to hmrc years ago but are still trading , and evading vat , today",1.0
guardian investigations found amazon even offering extensive support services at its british warehouses to overseas sellers that were doing little to mask their vat evasion,1.0
"as well as advertising these sellers goods on amazon co uk , it holds items in amazon uk warehouses , arranges delivery to addresses across britain , and deals with complaints and returned goods",1.0
amazon warehouse staff even offer gift wrapping services on behalf of the fraudster sellers,1.0
"there is no suggestion amazon or ebay knowingly facilitate specific fraudulent vat free sales , but the two us groups are nevertheless well aware that evasion in online shopping is a major problem",1.0
"meanwhile , the sellers themselves are often based overseas , with little or nothing known about their uk sales activities by hmrc",1.0
"one such seller , a company based in dubai , offered an ipad air 2 for sale on amazon co uk",1.0
"the ipad was sold at 456 68 , which was a similar price to that on offer at apple s own online store however , the apple store price included a 78 17 vat charge while the dubai based amazon seller charged no vat at all",1.0
"asked for a vat receipt , the ipad seller said in an email we don t supply uk vat receipt , sorry",1.0
"many sellers contacted by the guardian were similarly open about not charging vat thank you for your letter and sorry to tell you we do not have uk vat receipt we are located in china , said one our vat is still in the application , said another",1.0
"a third seller even offered to cut a deal , offering to share part of the proceeds of the vat fraud if you want the vat receipt , it will be after your purchase a week later otherwise , we will offer some discount to you directly , the seller said in an email looking forward to your reply",1.0

a former director of an nhs trust is suing jeremy hunt for religious discrimination after he was effectively barred from applying for positions following his public opposition to gay adoption,1.0
"richard page has lodged a claim at the employment tribunal , saying his televised comments in 2015 that it was in the best interests of a child to have a mother and father stemmed from his christian faith",1.0

she said government assurances that equality legislation would not lead to the removal of people who expressed christian views while holding public positions had turned out to be baseless,1.0

"there is a popular misconception that becoming a landlord is purely a monetary decision , complemented by the myth that the only task involved is counting the never ending flow of money , then deciding how to spend or hoard it my decision to move into this profession was driven by a number of factors , none of which related to it being a supposedly lucrative occupation",1.0
"i bailed out of the business world at the relatively young age of 30 after one too many conflicts , my fiery temperament and straight talking approach ruffling more than a few feathers however , each job move during my short and turbulent career had created a small pot of severance pay and in the pre bubble days of the london property market this was sufficient to put down a deposit each time and build up a small portfolio",1.0
"working for myself , managing a portfolio without the need to consult others and play politics , turned out to be much better suited to my personality i like the challenge of being ceo , marketing director , construction manager , interior designer , concierge , and yes , general dogsbody , all at once it s simplistic to look at the wealth i have created and think i have ruthlessly accumulated without consideration for others but with no pension to speak of and the desire to provide for my children , i am proud to have this business to safeguard our futures",0.0
"however , the real passion that inspired me to enter a business that is much tougher than most imagine , is a love of period properties i have no idea where it came from , but the moment i see a house with intricate mouldings , parquet floors or other character features , my heart starts to race just thinking about how it could look once restored typically , a single project takes 18 months from start to finish and many , many sleepless nights",1.0
"inspiring as it has been to have an interesting niche , the day to day work is often highly repetitive , with all too frequent peaks of stress for every hour consumed with choosing a new sofa , vintage rug , or flicking through an interior design magazine , there are 30 spent dealing with an endless stream of leaking showers , malfunctioning boilers , blocked gutters , not to mention moaning tenants , reluctant builders , arrogant architects and tedious government regulations invariably , a crisis appears in the most inopportune moments there is rarely such a thing as a weekend off",1.0
"it is understandable to see tenants as powerless victims , subject to the whims of their landlord s commercial agenda , but it can and does cut both ways most tenants are genuinely decent people and simply want a nice place to live , but as in all walks of life some are capricious , irresponsible and even blatantly dishonest",1.0
illegal sub lettings are a constant bane serious maintenance problems have built up over months then are casually mentioned in passing in a belated monosyllabic communication in 25 years i can count on one hand the number of times a tenant has confessed willingly to property damage and offered to pay or fix it many wish to instantly break contracts when it is no longer convenient for them to live there,1.0
"a tenant s failure to pay rent is usually a rare occurrence , but when it does happen it s crucial to treat the problem sensitively rather than instantly reach for the lawyer s phone number there is often a personal or economic problem causing the arrears and once this is understood a solution can usually be found one tenant who had been renting from me for five years lost their job and started drinking heavily i found out that they had borrowed substantially to finance several months rent while out of work the situation could not go on we chatted extensively and through a combination of a rent moratorium , shortening of the contract and the promise of an excellent reference , an amicable solution was found",1.0
"it would be hypocritical of me not to sometimes feel a twinge of guilt owning numerous properties while a younger generation struggles to get their foot on the ladder however , building up the portfolio has been my life s work and i have poured a huge amount of time , energy , passion and money into it a process which never stops a vibrant city economy such as london needs a good quality stock of rental properties to meet its citizens frequently changing circumstances it does frustrate me hugely reading about slum landlords with their ruthless commercial practices , or speculative buy to let investors gobbling up soulless new builds furnished with cheap cookie cutter interiors for maximum commercial gain i have to accept that it is part of the business i am in to be tarred with the same brush",1.0
"controversial as airbnb and its counterparts are , they are a game changer that is here to stay i branched out into more short term arrangements three years ago even the best long term tenant gets a little jaded after a while in the treatment of your properties , so it has been a breath of fresh air dealing with guests who are genuinely thrilled to rent from your portfolio the other plus is that with shorter rental periods , the bad guests usually leave before they have time to do much damage",1.0
"such short term lets have been criticised as some kind of cash cow but the amount of work involved in even a single rental is breathtaking the property maintenance and cleaning has to compete with a five star hotel and you are in constant touch with guests at all times of the day and night fail in any of this and your rating plummets and the property will sink without trace on the listings you habitually feel like an insecure , over sensitive actor as you pore over the latest review",1.0
"it has also created interesting new scenarios with some bookings not quite what they seem with the elegant period style interiors i utilise , the temptation to rent them for more salubrious motives is too much for some guests one of my first bookings comprised of five guests doing a photoshoot for a magazine although i politely requested no porn prior to booking , a pretty model proceeded to run around the patio of the building wearing only lingerie , to the delight of the elderly residents",1.0
"others have surreptitiously used my properties for commercial purposes , paying a fraction of the commercial rate of an official location it is a cat and mouse game trying to spot them however the majority of guests are lovely and have allowed me to recover a sense of pride in what i do , given all the negative publicity frequently surrounding landlords the schadenfreude from giving overpriced , bland corporate hotel chains a kick in the teeth is an added plus",1.0
"as i sit in my home office at 7am and deal with a leaking shower tray in an edwardian house for the eighth time in nine years , it is easy to fantasise about a profession with less daily drudgery and more stability it can also be wearying being responsible for the accommodation for typically 20 people every day and night , 365 days of the year but as a new booking comes in from beijing or berlin , or the photos arrive from a recently executed renovation , a surge of adrenalin kicks in and i am ready to face the day s challenges",1.0

"alex spent 675 on a washing machine and a fridge freezer from littlewoods , opting to buy now pay later at the time his income was sufficient to make the repayments before the end of the interest free period , but when he was suddenly made redundant he couldn t afford to repay the debt in time , and then an interest rate of 39 kicked in",1.0

"alex s difficulties were compounded by the fact that interest rates on goods bought from catalogues tend to be higher than those on mainstream credit at this time of year it can be tempting to use these firms to buy christmas gifts , but finance experts warn that if you re not going to pay off your borrowing quickly , you could end up paying a high price",1.0
"traditional catalogues such as freemans and littlewoods have been around for decades they allowed customers to shop at home and spread the cost with a range of payment options the rise of the internet means these brands now operate online , and have been joined by a host of catalogue style firms selling clothes , gadgets , gifts and furniture",1.0

"very also offers low monthly payments as an option , allowing customers to take as long as they like by paying the minimum each month 5 or 7 of their account balance but a customer doing this would take five and half years to repay a 500 debt , paying 314 in interest in the process paying 100 a month instead of the minimum would mean the debt was repaid in six months , with an interest bill of 48",1.0

"shop direct also owns littlewoods its customers can spread the cost with at least 20 weeks interest free borrowing after that interest kicks in , although the littlewoods website doesn t display the representative rate a spokesperson told the observer that the rate depends on the individual customer s circumstances , but that only a minority choose to arrange their repayments so that they attract interest the majority pay the full cash price before the interest opt out period is over the most common rate of interest for those that do pay interest on bnpl transactions is 44 9",1.0
"grattan was the only company the observer came across that provided a worked example of the cost implications of not repaying a bnpl deal in time it states failure to pay a 200 debt in 12 months incurs an interest charge of 60 69 , and the new balance of 260 69 then incurs interest at a typical rate of 34 9 until repaid",1.0
"andrew hagger of financial website moneycomms says many people wouldn t buy things from catalogues if they were aware of the potential cost because the interest charges are applied over multiple weeks or months , the customer loses track of how much they are actually paying back , he says much like payday loans and credit builder type credit cards , the interest rates are high because the default rates and non payment issues are more common than with mainstream credit",1.0

it is understood that ministers are considering forcing rail operators to alert passengers who are using station ticket machines or buying from the ticket office if there is a cheaper way to make their journey,1.0
"under the ticketing settlement agreement of 1995 , train operators are only obliged to tell customers of the most suitable ticket for their journey",1.0
"a source indicated that the government was believed to be planning to order firms to be more consistent on conditions , such as peak time restrictions , attached to tickets",1.0
"according to the times , passengers travelling between london and birmingham are offered more than 40 different fares and there are an estimated 16m different train fares available on the uk s rail network",1.0
"the paper reported that different self service machines inside the same train station offer vastly different fares for the same journey , meaning some passengers end up paying more",1.0
"stephen joseph , executive director of the campaign for better transport , told the paper there are 16m fares on the national rail database anything that makes the system more transparent is very welcome , but this must go further and look at the real fundamentals of the ticketing system",1.0
"a spokesman for the rail delivery group , which represents train operators , said we want rail customers to get the best possible deal every time we re making it easier and quicker for people to pay to travel by train with smarter ticketing , and we want to speed up improvements that will mean simpler , clearer fares that people can trust",1.0

"the government may be preparing to increase the official state pension age to 70 for millions of people currently in their 20s , a former minister has claimed",1.0
steve webb said documents produced by the department for work and pensions suggested a more aggressive timetable on state pension age \( spa \) increases than previously planned was being prepared,1.0
"this could affect tens of millions of workers aged under 55 , and bring a pension age of 70 into the official timetable for the first time for people currently aged between 22 and 30 , he added the current official spa for people in their 20s is 68 , though under the existing schedule it could be expected to rise to 69",1.0
"the spa is the earliest age someone can start receiving their state pension , and is due to rise to 66 between 2018 and 2020 , to 67 between 2026 and 2028 , and then to 68 between 2044 and 2046",1.0
"an official review is taking place into the future of the state pension , and on 16 november the dwp asked the government actuary s department \( gad \) to look at projected life expectancy in future years it wants the department to set out a schedule for spa increases , assuming the government sticks to its previously announced policy that people should spend two thirds of their adult life in work and one third \( 33 3 \) in retirement",1.0
"but the dwp also requested figures for people spending 32 of their adult life in retirement the dwp said this reflects the experiences of those reaching state pension age over the last 20 years , but webb said this failed to take account of more recent improvements in longevity he said that asking for figures based on 32 was an unexpected move",1.0
"the move pushes out the age at which the spa can be paid out , according to analysts by pension consultancy firm willis towers watson",1.0
"webb , a former pensions minister who is now director of policy at mutual insurer royal london , said the previous policy strikes a fair balance between expecting people to work longer and allowing people to enjoy a decent retirement",1.0
"if the government is planning to force tens of millions of people to work to 68 , 69 or even 70 , then it should be transparent about its plans this would be a huge shift and should be properly debated , not buried in a technical document seen only by specialists , said webb",1.0
"willis towers watson looked at what switching from the existing 33 3 formula to 32 would mean for the spa , using official life expectancy projections it said people born between march 1962 and april 1972 would see their pension age rise from 67 now to 68 meanwhile , those born between march 1973 and april 1985 would have a pension age of 69 rather than the present 68 those born between march 1986 and april 1994 would see their spa rise from an assumed 69 to 70",1.0
a dwp spokesperson said this work forms part of our research ahead of the first state pension age review it s important we have a clear understanding of how the current system is working for pensioners before we undertake the review,1.0
"willis towers watson said that if the decision had to be about how to take money off the public rather than whether to do so , later retirement may appear more palatable than higher tax rates for \( often \) the same people",1.0
"it added later working can boost economic output and tax revenues , too there was barely a squeak of protest when the government announced that the spa would reach 67 in 2028",1.0
"possible future changes to state pension entitlements were hinted at by the chancellor , philip hammond , in his autumn statement when he said as we look ahead to the next parliament , we will need to ensure we tackle the challenges of rising longevity and fiscal sustainability",1.0

"when andrew hegerty started investigating how automation could improve his engineering business in mackay seven months ago , a few eyebrows were raised",1.0
various economists predict automation is on the cusp of destroying millions of australian jobs and hegerty s was a labour intensive workplace,1.0
"for hegerty , fear has been replaced by a belief that automation not only holds the key to long term survival but it can create better jobs than those replaced",1.0
"more to the point , he says there is simply no choice businesses like his can embrace automation or disappear i believe that automation will be the cornerstone of our business within the next five years , he says manual fabrication will become the exception rather than the rule",1.0
"hegerty s company , the mackay based team group \( australia \) , provides engineering , fabrication , maintenance and other services to the mining industry , mainly in nearby central queensland , but now also to some overseas clients",1.0
north and central queensland are exactly the sort of locations economists say could be savaged by workplace automation if the right policies are not put in place to foster innovation and skills for a new marketplace,1.0
"examples of automation are popping up regularly in regional australia driverless trucks have been operating above ground for some time , particularly in western australia , and now queensland university of technology is working with caterpillar to develop driverless trucks that can operate in underground mines",1.0
"the community for economic development of australia released a report last year that found more than 5 million current australian jobs , or 40 of the workforce , have a moderate to high likelihood of disappearing in the next 10 to 15 years owing to technological advancements for regional areas with a focus on mining or manufacturing , the figure is 60",1.0
"the wording of these predictions is important the experts say 5 million current jobs will be replaced but they do not claim that will be the total decline in australian employment they say there is a need to ensure those jobs can be replaced by different ones , with new skill sets",1.0
"ceda s chief executive officer , prof stephen martin , says although mining and manufacturing jobs are most at risk from automation , the impact will spread much further , affecting jobs that involve low levels of social interaction , low levels of creativity , or low levels of mobility and dexterity",1.0
"these could include brokers , mechanics , cashiers , construction workers , accountants and real estate agents",1.0
"computers are becoming increasingly capable in all these roles our labour market will be fundamentally reshaped by the scope and breadth of technological change , and if we do not embrace massive economic reform and focus on incentivising innovation , we will simply be left behind in an increasingly competitive global marketplace , martin says",1.0
"this industrial revolution , like others before it , will bring the opportunity to create new and more exciting jobs but only if the policy settings and workplace culture are in place",1.0
"mackay is a classic example of a region with plenty at stake as automation looms on the horizon a huge percentage of its workers are either in the mines \( on drive in drive out or fly in fly out arrangements \) or in workplaces providing services to the mining sector the region s employment figures have d been dented by low coal prices , forcing a degree of introspection and adaptation",1.0
hegerty travelled to the us to learn more about how robotics and automation could improve his workplace what he discovered there strengthened his resolve and he says once the first mental step is taken beyond the fear of job losses,1.0
"i think not viewing this progression as exciting is counterproductive , he says with australia s relatively high wage rates and competition for overseas markets , if we are going to be viable as a business , it has to be for more than the price of freight otherwise foreign competitors will take over",1.0
"on his us trip , hegerty saw manufacturing businesses performing tasks with automation that his workers in mackay were doing manually",1.0
"he also discovered that very few workplaces had made a successful transition with the sort of processes he would require , so there were no illusions about the difficulties ahead we met with representatives of the lincoln electric company and their subsidiaries to discuss robotic automation for our business , he says",1.0
"while the technology that we were shown was mind blowing , it was the process support that we received that was the kicker of our trip",3.0
"not only does hegerty believe this transition will ensure the survival of his business in a global market where productivity and competitiveness are crucial , he has also noticed enthusiasm building among his employees they want to know what the future holds and what they can learn to be part of the process",1.0
"his belief that automation could safeguard the region s economy , rather than destroy it , is shared by others in the city mackay s deputy mayor , amanda camm , is chair of the council s economic development committee and believes automation offers a real opportunity",1.0
"she points to the city s status as a hub for high skilled mining services , as well as a geographical location that will allow it to capitalise on remote operations , such as driverless machinery",1.0
"regional hubs for mining services , such as mackay , can create jobs from innovation , but can the same be said for the mines themselves and the smaller towns around them \? martin says there is no clear answer to that question",1.0
he says the risk to australian jobs is significant because if the rest of the world moves ahead of australia the nation s businesses will become uncompetitive governments must start preparing the right policies to incentivise innovation and provide retraining opportunities for workers,1.0
"martin also says the private sector must take responsibility businesses need to accept change is happening and be looking for opportunities for how they can adapt and innovate in their business to keep pace and embrace the opportunities that technological advancement brings , he says",1.0
"for example , technology is making it easier to tap into global supply chains and sell to a much wider customer base and that can be done from anywhere",1.0
"martin also points out that the jobs of the future in australia are likely to be in the service sector , a significant shift from the years of the mining boom , and this will require a serious rethink of how we train and retrain our workforce",1.0
"one australian already building robotic technologies for the workplace is the queensland university of technology researcher prof peter corke for one of his current projects , he has developed robots to perform a task most people would assume requires the softness of a human hand fruit picking in this case , his robots are in active trials picking capsicums",1.0
"while a robotic picker might be expected to bruise fruit and vegetables , the technology is now so intelligent so millimetre perfect it can do the job as well as or better than humans",1.0
"it is a project with obvious relevance now , as the horticulture sector grapples with the shortage and high cost of human labour",1.0
"corke acknowledges that the development of such technology raises existential questions about employment but he is optimistic about how new , more prosperous jobs can be created to replace those lost",1.0
"he agrees that setting government policies to foster innovation industries is the key but he also throws the challenge down to australia s universities , claiming they must change their mindset",1.0
"we need to encourage our phd students to think their future isn t to become another academic , but it s perfectly respectable or maybe even a better option to go out and join industry , or even create an industry , he says",1.0

"it is with regret that we are informing you that gb energy supply is no longer trading , said its managing director , luke watson , on the company s website due to swift and significant increases in energy prices over recent months and , as a small supplier our inability to forward buy energy to allow us to access the best possible wholesale prices , means that the position of the business has become untenable",1.0
customers are no longer able to log on to gb energy s website to access their accounts and some took to social media concerned they would lose credit balances built up over the summer months but ofgem advised account holders to sit tight and wait to hear from their new supplier on how they would get their money back,1.0
"there is no need to worry as we will ensure your energy supplies are safe , said rachel fletcher , ofgem s senior partner for consumers and competition ofgem are actively working with the industry to ensure your transition to a new supplier is as smooth as possible while this process is under way our advice is not to do anything as you can continue to rely on your energy supply as normal",1.0
"the government has sought to increase competition in the retail market dominated by the big six suppliers british gas , e on , npower , edf , scottish power and sse there are now 41 companies competing for british households , but the business models of the smaller entrants are now being tested as electricity and gas prices start to rise partly because of the devaluation of sterling since the brexit vote",1.0
"in an interview earlier this year , watson , a former submariner who worked in sales before moving into the energy sector , said it had been fortunate that wholesale costs had been low over the past couple of years",1.0
"i think the challenge for independent suppliers will come when there is volatility in the wholesale market , he told the trade magazine utility week in june that is when the hedging strategy comes into play and we are very conscious of that it is a risk and we are monitoring prices three times a day",1.0
"gb energy previously traded as altitude energy supply from 2013 to 2014 and made a loss of 630 , 018 on sales of 22 2m in 2015 the company operated from preston and had a staff of less than 20 despite its large customer base",1.0
"ofgem will move gb energy customers on to what is known as a deemed contract the watchdog says on its website these are usually more expensive the supplier takes on more risk , as customers are moved to a new supplier quickly without the usual background credit checks so , they also charge more , to make up for this extra risk",1.0
it is then up to gb energy customers to ensure they are on the best tariff or switch to a new supplier but with wholesale prices up this year it is unlikely they will be able to find a deal similar to their existing plan,1.0

such nods to drivers and hauliers are easily explained in a nation where cars are by far the most popular mode of transport and where almost three times more goods are moved by roads than by water and rail combined promises to bust traffic jams and plug potholes are easy wins for politicians as is endlessly freezing fuel duty,1.0
"similarly , when it comes to appearing to be doing something about the productivity puzzle it is far easier to talk about roads than the thorny issue of britain s addiction to low paid , low skilled work",1.0
"but hammond will not be able to escape this reality if he is serious about raising productivity a measure of what is produced for every hour worked likewise , if he and theresa may want to address the economic discontent that was partly responsible for the brexit vote he will have to ensure any productivity gains he does eke out are shared by low paid workers",1.0
"as the chancellor said himself , britain s productivity gap with its neighbours has real repercussions on living standards",1.0
"in the real world , it takes a german worker four days to produce what we make in five which means , in turn , that too many british workers work longer hours for lower pay than their counterparts , hammond said",1.0

"roads and inventions like next generation electric vehicles are all well and good , but in an economy dominated by the services sector , it too needs attention if the country is ever going to make meaningful inroads on productivity",1.0
"of course , many of the technological advances that are made under the badge of innovation can help in the services sector internet banking and automatic checkouts are obvious examples",1.0
but there is also evidence that services employers can make productivity gains by changing the way they treat their employees,1.0
"the joseph rowntree foundation has been exploring this link between the prevalence of low paid work and low productivity in an analysis with the thinktank , the institute for public policy research pdf , the charity found low pay sectors constitute about 23 of our economy , but account for about a third of the uk s productivity gap with leading western european economies",1.0
"jrf is rightly telling ministers to broaden the industrial strategy to include low paying parts of the economy such as retail , care and catering , and that by doing so they could make greater economic gains and lift hundreds of thousands of people out of working poverty",1.0
"finding ways to lift productivity in those sectors is not easy but if solving our low productivity problem was simple , countless experts would not have dubbed it a puzzle",1.0
"there are three key areas that employers and policymakers can explore , beyond the usual technology fixes",1.0
"the first is the relationship between pay and productivity in a classic chicken and egg situation , economists argue over what comes first low pay or low productivity",1.0
"there is an argument that employers can only afford to raise wages , when productivity goes up but work by the living wage foundation and others has found raising pay can in turn raise productivity better paid workers are more motivated and more likely to stick around and accumulate skills seen another way , when employers are forced to pay more , they are more likely to seek ways to make work more productive ideally , this will happen with the government s mandatory national living wage",1.0
"the second area is flexible working consider the case of a woman working for a retailer she acquires years of experience , then has a child , takes maternity leave and returns to work part time her employer wants to capitalise on the woman s experience and offers her a senior role fearful of how that new role will fit in with her childcare arrangements , the woman turns down the promotion",1.0
"when jrf commissioned research into productivity and pay in the retail sector by the economist and former mp kitty ussher , she found about half of retail workers who already worked part time said they would only accept a promotion if they could remain part time little surprise then , that the study also revealed half of retail workers felt overqualified for the work they did",1.0
"clearly , employers are missing a trick when they fail to help workers find ways to balance family commitments with career progression",1.0
"alongside these workers for whom the overriding priority was to have controlled hours , ussher identified a second group who wanted to work more hours and gain promotion to increase their earnings among that second group there was evidence of frustration at the lack of opportunities to get on",1.0
"this leads to the third area engagement if staff do not feel involved in deciding their hours or career path , it is unlikely they will feel ready to share suggestions on how their workplace could run more efficiently productivity suffers as a result",1.0
"words like engagement sound fluffy , but manufacturing which consistently outperforms on productivity has been doing this for decades in a well run factory , staff are actively encouraged to make suggestions on small changes that could raise their productivity , such as the positioning of a tool it s called continuous improvement",1.0
"ussher s research found this kind of engagement was lacking in retail , where 72 of workers felt they could see possible improvements in how their business ran , but just 44 said those ideas were taken seriously",1.0
"with management clearly failing these workers , it was welcome that hammond s autumn statement contained 13m for a scheme to boost uk management skills",1.0
"but workers need more than just better managers to be more productive they need better career paths , including quality apprenticeships , and they need more economic security , not zero hours contracts",1.0

"as i see from many posts on money forums and social media , i know i am not alone in complaining about the john lewis partnership credit card but my situation is vexing me john lewis finance revamped its website in early october , asking cardholders to re register i did so then , two weeks ago , i realised that my card expired this month and a replacement had not arrived",1.0
"it was apparent from the online posts about failed payments and direct debit problems that all was not hunky dory john lewis said there was a high volume of calls and warned of a wait of up to 45 minutes after 70 minutes i gave up and instead tried secure messaging , which then collapsed , so i sent a letter of complaint and asked that my card be mailed within a week",0.0

"what a shambles the john lewis partnership card and yes , it is administered by hsbc is the retailer s flagship credit card product , offering rewards which can be used for shopping at john lewis and waitrose but , from our postbag alone , it is clear that changes to it systems in october have triggered major problems including rejected online payments , problems logging in , unhelpful and unsympathetic responses from customer services , and very long wait times when trying to contact them we have included a second letter below but have received many more",1.0
"the company admits there have been problems following recent changes to the website we experienced some initial technical issues which have now been resolved this led to high volumes of calls to our customer services team , which resulted in customers encountering delays we are very sorry for this and have significantly increased the size of the team to reduce call waiting times we can assure customers that any late payment fees , along with the interest which was incurred as a result of the recent technical issues , have been refunded customers should be able to spend on their card as normal , however if they are experiencing problems we would ask them to contact us so we can investigate on a case by case basis",1.0

the real shock about this week s decision to ban letting fees to tenants is that it did not happen earlier for more than a decade in money we have highlighted the exploitative activity of some \( but by no means all \) letting agents it evidently reached such absurd levels that in the end even a tory government had to end the farce,1.0
"we have seen letting agents demand 800 in fees on a 650 a month one bed flat bills for 360 for running a standardised contract through the photocopier , and 90 for a credit check that costs the agent little more than a fiver tenants have had to go through the rigmarole of these sorts of bills every time they are forced to move",1.0
back in may 2004 i wrote how some letting agents were deceiving tenants out of huge amounts of cash with myriad charges and fees that verge on the criminal in 2009 i wrote letting agents are they even worse than estate agents \? the same year i suggested we let letting agents sweat finally in june this year i wrote a column headlined it s time to end the great letting agency rip off in england and wales,1.0
"truth is , some agents got too greedy not that many will agree when news of the ban emerged , haart said it was yet another unwelcome and haphazard government intervention yet another government blow for landlords lcp , a london agent , said it was a further attack on beleaguered landlords",1.0
"the victim mentality among some agents and landlords is comical official figures this week showed that over the past four years , average incomes have nudged ahead by 1 7 a year , while rents have gone up 2 2 and house prices have jumped 5 6 in parts of the country , it has been a lot worse",1.0
"it is simply undeniable that the owners of property have won , and tenants have lost buy to let merchants have made gains of 1 , 400 since 1996 , far better than any other investment yet it s these winners who bleat loudest if i were them i d have kept my gob shut about just how much money i had been skimming off working people",1.0
"some more perspicacious landlords saw it coming david lawrenson of lettingfocus com said banning all tenant fees is a draconian step however , the letting agency business , in particular , only has itself to blame too many agents charged rapacious levels of fees , frequently far in excess of the actual costs also , we are convinced too many engaged in hiding fees , only revealing them at the last minute when the tenant was committed",1.0
"letting agents will now have to try to pass the costs on to landlords , which is only right because they are the customer and are in a much better position to decide if the fee is acceptable , or if they wish to take their business elsewhere unfortunately , on forums such as property118 some agents are trying to devise workarounds one alleges that larger agents are secretly discussing setting up referencing companies , and will only deal with prospective tenants who will use their company",1.0
i doubt such ruses will work i m more inclined to agree with an agent on the same forum who said that the ban on fees has been in scotland for many years and the sun is still rising in the morning and the rental market is alive and kicking one thing i find strange is the view that landlords will have to put up rents to accommodate this,1.0

"seddon s nightmare began when he made his twice weekly visit to see his housebound mother who lives alone near the waitrose store in chesham , bucks each week he shops for her , but as he left the store on that fateful saturday afternoon he was confronted by two police officers they seized me , then handcuffed me with my arms behind my back , stating that they were arresting me on suspicion of shoplifting 17 days earlier , in spite of the fact that on that day i hadn t even been in chesham the security guard thrust a mobile phone in my face with a cctv still on it and screamed do you deny this is you \? at me all this was going on in front of dozens of shoppers",1.0
"he says he was not allowed to call his mother , who he knew would be distressed when he inexplicably failed to return he was held at aylesbury police station for more than six hours",1.0
"despite the nightmare of the situation i assumed that i could clear up what was obviously a case of mistaken identity but i was wrong when i was eventually questioned , i was shown cctv footage from the afternoon of 11 may showing a bald male aged about 60 concealing 100 of meat products in a bag and leaving without paying i was told that i had been identified as the offender by the security guard from a cctv still he had downloaded to his mobile but on that day i was working on a book at my north london flat and , ironically , visited the waitrose store on the holloway road",1.0
"in a statement given to the police after seddon s arrest , the security guard claimed seddon had also visited the chesham store just a few days earlier and become nervous when he saw he was being watched he said he then saw seddon run from the store",1.0
"seddon believes the police were greatly influenced by this claim he says the cctv evidence , not available at the time of his arrest , shows that while he was in the store at that time , it did not show him running away",2.0
"i had come into the store for a bacon and egg sandwich for lunch , saw that there were none on the shelves and decided to go to sainsbury s instead i left at a normal pace and never noticed the security guard i even complained about the lack of bacon and egg sandwiches on twitter but the police believed the security guard s account of me running from the store , as well as his claim that i was the man shown on cctv stealing meat products , and charged me with the earlier theft",2.0
"as a result , seddon says he was forced to hire first a solicitor and then a barrister at a cost of 6 , 000 plus vat knowing that he had been in london when the theft took place , but living alone , he had to employ a mobile phone expert to provide evidence to that effect he also employed a cctv specialist , john kennedy , who made his name in the jamie bulger case in which cctv footage was central to the conviction of the boys who abducted him",1.0
"kennedy s report states clearly that seddon was not the person who had stolen the meat , and that the security guard s claim that seddon had run from the store was not true it lists several key differences in the look of the two men , and even notes that their jackets were of different colours , contrary to what the guard told police the expert report suggested that the photo of the thief on the security guard s mobile phone was distorted in the act of downloading it the image was compressed and the aspect ratio changed as a result , it said",1.0
"after seddon had paid for all this , the case was dropped the day before it was due to be heard at high wycombe magistrates court on the instruction of the crown prosecution service but seddon says he has since been told by his solicitor that he will recoup no more than 20 30 of his costs , leaving him substantially out of pocket having cleared my name i approached waitrose with my expert report , naively thinking that it would be horrified by what had happened and would offer me compensation for the inconvenience , distress and financial loss , as well as take urgent steps to ensure that such an incident could not be repeated , he says",1.0
"instead , he says the supermarket spent two months fobbing him off before concluding that its security guard had done nothing wrong",2.0
"they offered me a derisory 500 as a goodwill gesture to a valued customer their emails throughout were headed waitrose customer feedback as if the whole affair was of no more consequence than an unsatisfactory purchase from the bakery if a security guard cannot distinguish between running and walking then it is a matter of significant public concern that they continue to be employed as a security guard , he says",1.0
"a spokesman for waitrose declined to offer an explanation as to what had happened instead , he pointed us towards thames valley police we are very sorry to hear of the distress mr seddon has experienced you will need to speak to the thames valley police press office about the decisions taken we are continuing our conversations with mr seddon and the third party security company with whom we work so , as you will appreciate , it would not be appropriate for us to comment further at this stage",1.0
"seddon says questions remain as to why he was treated so badly at a meeting last week with thames valley police , which is still investigating his complaint against the force , seddon says he was told by a long serving officer that he had not ever heard of a comparable incident",2.0
"seddon is still furious at his treatment at the hand of the store , and is considering legal action if waitrose will not accept responsibility , then sooner or later it will happen again to somebody else for my part , i would have been better off accepting a police caution for a crime that i did not commit and paying waitrose for 100 of meat products that somebody else stole it is morally repugnant that i should be left thousands of pounds out of pocket when i have done nothing wrong , he says",1.0
thames valley police said that as it had received a complaint in relation to this investigation it would be inappropriate to comment further,2.0
"christopher seddon s treatment at the hands of both waitrose and the police shows a gap in the law a completely innocent person can be arrested and prosecuted and may not be entitled to any compensation , not even all of his legal costs , writes barrister richard colbey",2.0
"when police make an arrest they are not liable for the consequences if they act on reasonable suspicion there are sound public policy reasons why they should be free to do their job without worrying too much about the consequences , so long as they behave reasonably",2.0
"here the report by the security staff gave them that suspicion and meant they were duty bound to question seddon , and entitled to arrest him marching him away in handcuffs was unnecessary and apparently deplored by a more mature police officer , but it was not unlawful",2.0
"had the security guard effected the arrest the situation would have been different there is not the same public interest in citizens arrests , and civilians have no protection if they arrest an innocent person , however reasonable the suspicion",2.0
"in 1992 a marina davidson was accused , wrongly , of stealing from woolworths in bangor the court of appeal said that a security guard , and hence a woolworths employee , could only be liable for an arrest if it was effected by the police ie , if they had given some direction or made a direct request or encouragement that the arrest should be made there the court of appeal decided that the store detective had merely made a report but the guard in seddon s case may have overstepped the mark",1.0
"also it is possible that seddon could claim slander , but that is a notoriously difficult and expensive cause of action he would have to show the guard acted maliciously as , otherwise , what the guard said to the police would be privileged and also that he suffered serious harm a somewhat vague statutory hurdle introduced in 2014 to discourage the proliferation of defamation claims",2.0
"a person acquitted of a crime will usually be able to recover his costs from public funds , but only at fairly derisory legal aid rates these will be nothing like 10 , 000 even for a trial that goes ahead , and are typically hundreds , rather than thousands , of pounds",2.0
"the law society advises solicitors to warn clients where they are incurring costs that are unlikely to be recoverable , and if seddon s solicitors had not given such advice then it could have taken a hit on much of the difference between its bill and the amount recovered",1.0
update christopher seddon has confirmed that his solicitors did advise him that he may not be able to recover all his legal costs of defending himself the barrister s view was amended on 28 november 2016 to clarify this point,2.0

so will the ban on lettings agents charging fees to tenants push rents up \? that s the question many renters will be asking after the government s autumn statement announcement,1.0
"the good news is that this is more than a proposal the chancellor , philip hammond , said ministers will bring in a ban , which means that tenants will no longer have to pay fees that can run into the hundreds when they sign a new tenancy agreement but some felt there was a worrying lack of detail hammond merely said it would happen as soon as possible , while the treasury said the government will consult on this in due course so it s far from clear when the fees will be outlawed",1.0
"but how much do people actually pay \? there are varying figures the latest english housing survey , published in july , found that 40 of private renters were charged a fee by a letting agency or landlord in 2014 15 , at an average of 223 citizens advice last year put the total average tenancy fee at 337 , while a 2013 report from housing charity shelter said one in seven \( 15 \) renters using an agency forked out more than 500",1.0
"however , the biggest area of debate was whether the ban will drive up rents , on the grounds that landlords will now have to pay these costs and will simply pass them on to tenants or will landlords or letting agents absorb the costs \?",1.0
guardian money decided to round up the views of experts and commentators on the key question of whether the ban will mean higher rents,1.0
"generation rent , which campaigns for better privately rented homes , says we don t think it will push up rents , mainly because rents are really just set by what people are prepared to pay in the market rents have been rising because demand has been so high the organisation says the fact that there is such huge variation in the level of fees charged shows there is a lot of scope for getting these costs down it adds that landlords will have the power to shop around for lower fees",1.0
"pricedout , the group campaigning for affordable house prices , believes it is very likely that landlords and agents will bear most of the costs , as they have done in scotland , which banned fees years ago it adds that even if all fees were to be passed on in the form of higher rent , this will still benefit tenants , as their costs will be spread and they will find it easier to move home , giving them more bargaining power",1.0
"shelter published a report in 2013 that looked at what had happened in scotland there , it has been illegal to charge premiums fees charged at the start of a tenancy , in addition to rent and the deposit to renters since 1984 however , the law wasn t enforced until 2012 , when it was clarified shelter said its research had shown that landlords in scotland were no more likely to have increased rents since 2012 than landlords elsewhere in the uk in fact , only one landlord in 120 surveyed said they had noticed an increase in agency fees and had passed this on to their tenants",1.0
"easyproperty , the online estate agent , says any sensible agency won t pass on the charges to landlords due to competition in the sector , so we don t foresee rent rises , as there is no need to add the fees to rents",1.0
housing minister gavin barwell was asked two months ago whether he would follow the scottish example and ban letting fees he tweeted bad idea landlords would pass cost to tenants via rent we re looking at other ways to cut upfront costs raise standards it s not clear whether barwell has since changed his mind or had it changed for him,1.0
"beresfords , a chain of estate agents , says ultimately landlords will be expected to pick up most , if not all , of any fees lost by agents however , landlords will want to recoup such increases , and the most obvious way to do so is by increasing the rent unfortunately , over time , tenants could end up paying much more in uplifted rent than what they would have expected to pay in initial fees at the outset",1.0
"the residential landlords association says this will not help tenants , especially those who are just managing agents fees have to be paid by somebody if any extra fees are passed on to landlords , tenants will end up paying them for ever , as rents will increase",1.0
"simon gerrard , md of london estate agency martyn gerrard and a past president of the national association of estate agents , says yields for landlords are already low , so lowering them further means landlords will simply sell rather than rent , which will push rents up even higher because there will be less stock he adds the landlords that do stay in the market will have to increase rents to cover these new costs",1.0
"lord bourne of aberystwyth , a communities minister , said during a house of lords debate on 18 november that gavin barwell has been clear that we must be mindful of the potential impact on rents from banning fees paid by tenants this is not a straightforward issue , and we have to be careful that any changes do not have impacts elsewhere",1.0
"over the past decade sarah cross has become an expert on london s rental market , having moved every year between 2007 and 2015 often not out of choice so she was pleased at the government s decision to ban letting agents fees to tenants that s a really positive thing previously we ve paid nearly 1 , 000 just in fees and charges",1.0
"like many young couples in the capital , cross and her partner work full time but are still priced out of buying they rent a very compact two bedroom house in leytonstone , east london , where they live with their son oliver who is nearly two and attends nursery",1.0
"she and her partner both earn above the national average their household income is 80 , 000 but they still can t afford to buy a family house in london we have no money to save after rent and bills , says cross , 31 , who works as an operations specialist for a major company this also means the couple s plans to grow their family are currently on hold we d like another child , but living in london limits your funds and we don t really feel like we have enough behind us to have a larger family",1.0
"the couple pay around 1 , 300 a month in rent , with childcare swallowing a further 1 , 000 they are clearly not financially destitute we go on holiday but cross adds one of us basically pays the rent and bills , and the other pays for childcare and essentials",1.0
"having had to move so often in the past , the birth of oliver in 2014 saw them negotiate a two year contract to ensure we wouldn t have to disrupt our whole lives one year later",1.0
"cross says that , like many people , they are in a catch 22 situation house prices are stratospheric because too few homes have been built in london to sustain the number of people , but they don t feel they can move out because the employment wouldn t be there",1.0
"she says something needs to be done to get the capital s housing market working properly she is intrigued by the news of 40 , 000 additional affordable homes , but says it s really important we build more affordable homes that are fit for purpose we ve viewed several shared ownership schemes and haven t found one appropriate for family living and that maybe we limit the price that we pay on rental properties",1.0
"cross is a supporter of the charity shelter , which also welcomed the decision to ban letting agent fees",1.0

"the sfo is investigating unaoil , a monaco based oil and gas firm , over allegations that it paid bribes to win contracts in several countries for dozens of multinationals , including the british engineering firm rolls royce according to the sfo , the alleged corruption is very extensive",2.0
"on thursday , unaoil opened its legal challenge in the high court in london , claiming that investigators working for the sfo unlawfully raided its headquarters in monaco and seized a large cache of its documents , phones and computer equipment in a cavalier fashion the firm alleges that the raid amounted to an excessively wide fishing expedition rather than a proper exercise of its legal powers",2.0
"unaoil has denied all wrongdoing in its submission to lord justice gross and mr justice nicol , unaoil described how the sfo asked the police in monaco to raid its hq in march and used a truck to transport the seized material to the uk",2.0

rolls royce said it was fully co operating with investigations into the allegations and could not comment in detail,2.0
"the sfo is opposing unaoil s legal challenge , maintaining that its actions were legal in its defence , the sfo said it had significant grounds to suspect that unaoil had paid bribes and or conspired together to pay bribes to high ranking iraqi and other public officials on behalf of its clients",2.0

"life has not been easy for paradise sorouri in the past seven years , the 27 year old has been forced to flee her country twice , received more death threats than she can count , and was brutally beaten by 10 men on the street and left to die her crime \? she covers her head with a baseball cap instead of a hijab , raises her voice for women s rights , and is afghanistan s first female rapper",2.0
"in a country where , according to the un , 87 of women have endured physical or sexual violence , paradise s scathing lyrics about gender inequality in post taliban afghanistan have served as a spark for change and a lightning rod for controversy she raps defiantly in dari about how women can get acid poured on their faces for resisting rape , be married off as children to older men , and belong to husbands who can set them on fire",2.0
"it doesn t matter if you are a singer , an artist , or a teacher , says paradise if you are a woman in afghanistan , you are a problem i am speaking out and fighting for women who don t have a voice",2.0
"speaking out has come at a price , but it has also garnered support paradise was recognised by the un in 2013 for promoting human rights , while she and her fiance diverse together they are known as 143band won the afghan atn network s award for best rap act in 2015 the duo are nominated again this year",2.0
"but as her popularity soared , so did the number of violent threats she received fearing for their safety , last year she and diverse fled afghanistan and joined the more than one million migrants who arrived in germany from the middle east",2.0
"in the process , the pair have begun to reach an entirely new audience , writing and producing songs in their berlin flat and touring throughout germany they release their first music video in two years next month for the song bosaye eshgh , they ve just headlined at the international femineast festival in stockholm , and rebel beats , a documentary about paradise s struggle as afghanistan s first female rapper , will appear in european film festivals early next year",2.0

"when diverse found her , paradise s clothes were torn and she was covered in blood he immediately took her to the police they told me i should stop singing , says paradise that s when i knew that if i stayed silent , nothing would change",2.0
"fearful of what might happen if they stayed in herat , the couple moved to neighbouring tajikistan in late 2010 , where paradise began writing songs about women s rights over diverse s beats the following year , they released faryad e zan \( woman s shout \) , the first song ever to feature a female afghan rapper in the years since , paradise says she feels proud and honoured to have ushered in a handful of other female rappers , even if several have claimed to be the country s first while simultaneously asking her for guidance",2.0
"during the next two years , the duo recorded nine more songs and shot five videos in the relative safety of tajikistan then , in the summer of 2012 , paradise received horrific news back in herat , to avoid being married off to men in their 60s , her two young cousins aged nine and 12 had burned themselves alive",2.0

"extra legal powers may be needed to prosecute hate preachers who encourage violent radicalisation in private conversations , according to the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation",2.0
"in his final report after six years in the influential post , david anderson qc says the requirement in the 2006 terrorism act that such persuasion needs to be published or delivered at a meeting should be re examined",2.0
"that change might make it possible to use undercover officers for the purposes of gathering evidence against those who are inspiring terrorists , he suggests",2.0
"it may also be necessary to specify more clearly examples of ways in which support for a proscribed organisation could be invited , he explains prosecutors with experience of such cases have told me that this could assist juries in matching the alleged conduct to the offence",2.0
"anderson , who stands down in february , was not formally recommending such changes but believed there should be a more detailed inquiry i offer them for discussion as a possible partial solution to the problems of prosecuting hate preachers , he writes , and in the spirit that our freedoms are better protected by a well functioning criminal law than they are by a system based on coercive civil orders of broad and uncertain scope",2.0
anderson says it is entirely fair to ask why the law did not catch up with anjem choudary who was convicted of inviting support for daesh earlier this year sooner he said the crown prosecution service considered choudary s activities on 10 occasions between 2002 and 2015,2.0
"in general conclusions , anderson observes laws against terrorism need to bear down hard on all kinds of extremists who espouse violence but it is important also that they do not alienate the rest of the population",2.0
"he welcomes the steady decline in the number of so called port stops , used to question and detain travellers to determine whether they are involved in terrorism they have fallen from 87 , 218 in 2009 10 to 28 , 083 last year",2.0
"my overall impression is that though port controls remain a frequently mentioned irritant , the terrorism acts are no longer the focus for grievance that they once were , anderson notes indeed they have been overtaken as a source of grievance by aspects of the prevent strategy to counter extremism",2.0
"the terrorism acts , he says , are a broadly proportionate reaction to the current threat he states i reject the false narrative of power hungry security services , police insensitivity to community concerns , and laws constantly being ratcheted up to new levels of oppression",2.0
"however , brexit could damage the uk s ability to lead european policy and promote european laws in the counter terrorism field , anderson says",2.0
"he adds there are strong operational reasons for maintaining access to eu mechanisms that others may devise brexit will not alter the fact that as crime including terrorist crime crosses borders with increasing ease , the same must be true of the information and resources that are needed by those who fight it",2.0
"in the report , written after the murder of the labour mp jo cox by the nazi sympathiser thomas mair , anderson says the organised extreme rightwing threat in the uk is perceived by the authorities to be fragmented , with no unifying ideology or set of principles",2.0
"in a document provided to me by the national counter terrorism policing operations centre in july 2016 , the threat of organised xrw groups was described as limited to low level protest and heated online debate",2.0
"there were no deaths or injuries from terrorism in britain during 2015 , the report says , unless one counts the injuries sustained by lyle zimmerman at leytonstone tube station in london in december in northern ireland , there were three security related deaths in the year to 31 march 2016",2.0
"the report adds outside northern ireland , there have been only two deaths in the uk from terrorist incidents since 56 people including four british suicide bombers were killed in the 7 7 london attacks of 2005 the continuation of that record is impressive",0.0
"the threat remains , however some attackers or would be attackers leave only a very limited intelligence trace , particularly if their radicalisation has been swift",2.0
"others come to the attention of the authorities but are not given the priority that their subsequent actions show them to have merited , often for understandable reasons and as was demonstrated recently in nice , even such an everyday object as a large motor vehicle can exact a horrible toll on the innocent when used by a person heedless of the consequences for his own life",2.0

"much has been written recently about the shocking conditions inside britain s jails suicides are occurring on average once every three days , and prison inspectors said this week that conditions in hmp hindley are among the worst they have ever seen",2.0
"it s about time that prisons stopped being holiday camps or at least that is what the daily mail would encourage you to think if you ask the average person on the street why someone would end up in prison , you are likely to get some version of because they have chosen to break the law and have harmed someone else and on prison s purpose \? they should be harsh places of punishment to set an example and act as a deterrent",2.0
"i work in the criminal justice system and have committed a large proportion of my life to trying to support offenders to turn their lives around so you might expect me to argue against that statement , to try to blame the wider socio economic picture and present a social justice argument about how we are all to blame for the crimes committed by these men and women",2.0
"however i completely agree that those who choose to commit crime should face incarceration that prisons should be well run by the prison staff who as society s representatives in prison should be setting the agenda , holding firm boundaries and delivering society s intention to both punish the offender and to minimise the chances of them choosing to break the law in the future so on that level , i believe that the current situation in prisons is a travesty prisons are chronically understaffed and the inmates have far more power than ever before",2.0
"contraband is commonplace where there is contraband , there is trade and where there is trade , there are people who control that trade who have status and power that they will seek to maintain we have allowed a situation to develop where prison becomes an environment where the very traits and tendencies that we would hope prison would diminish are in fact reinforced , as legitimate strategies for survival and for status",2.0
"staff shortages are now so acute that in many prisons , prisoners are spending 23 hours a day locked up denied access to education and training , exercise and other activity proved to decrease the likelihood to reoffending",2.0
"so even from that paradigm , of prisons being for people who have chosen to break the law , the situation in prisons is unacceptable",2.0
"however in our experience of working with young men involved in the criminal justice system , the percentage of those who consciously chose to break the law or harm another is small",2.0
"the others fall into two camps the first are those who see the supply of drugs to the marketplace as a victimless activity and the best means of making a living they have available , as an unskilled young male with no qualifications the second group are those so lacking in maturity that they end up committing crimes , not through an active , conscious choice but a failure of impulse control in the moment",2.0
"it is easy to judge both of those groups and to believe them to be as deserving of punishment i know i did before i had exposure to the reality of the lives they lived , i held strong views , typical of the middle class culture in which i grew up i judged drug dealers as preying on the weak in our society and was simply afraid of those who were so volatile and unpredictable i wanted them taken away",2.0
"i am now rather embarrassed to have held those views over the past decade working with offenders , i have had a number of realisations the first is that young men do not fully mature psychologically until they are in their mid 20s something that can be backed up by research and evidence i now count myself as fortunate that my middle class circumstances as a young man meant that my own behaviour through a lack of maturity did not bring me into contact with the criminal justice system",2.0
"the second realisation builds on that theme of there but for the winds of fate go i i have heard some truly heart breaking stories of neglect and abuse i have worked with young men who have been victims of sexual abuse , who as small children witnessed terrible domestic violence in the home , even watching their mother being raped i have had to ask myself whether if i d had similar experiences , i would be where i am today the answer is a resounding no emerging neuroscience supports this conclusion , especially for males",2.0
"the tragedy is that putting these vulnerable young men into a toxic prison environment is likely to decrease their chances of building a successful life for themselves being exposed to further trauma , living in a dangerous environment \( resulting in an almost constantly adrenalised state \) , where drugs are freely available and where positive role models are in short supply , are possibly the worst conditions in which to try to effect positive change is it any surprise that suicides happen so frequently \?",2.0
things were bad enough the advent of spice and other synthetic cannabis substances creates a huge additional challenge in the prison environment an odourless drug that is difficult to detect and can cause psychosis especially in people who have experienced early years trauma prison staff and others in the system have described it as a game changer,2.0
"we the taxpayers are currently spending around 35 , 000 per prisoner per year to provide places in these institutions that on almost every level are failing in 1993 , the prison population was 44 , 000 it s now 80 , 000",2.0
"the current system needs a radical rethink and a more nuanced approach to understand the reasons for offending and providing a sentence that is appropriate and has a chance of success until we start thinking in these terms and talking about sentencing reform , rather than simply prison reform , we are likely to retain a system that costs huge amounts of money , the lives of vulnerable people and the loss of human potential",2.0

"a judge who asked a complainant in a sexual assault trial why she couldn t just keep her knees together should be removed from the bench , an inquiry tasked with probing the matter has concluded",2.0
"in a unanimous recommendation released on wednesday , the five person inquiry committee of the canadian judicial council said robin camp committed misconduct while presiding over a 2014 trial into allegations of sexual assault",2.0
"the judge s conduct , the committee said in its report , was so manifestly and profoundly destructive of the concept of the impartiality , integrity and independence of the judicial role that public confidence is sufficiently undermined to render the judge incapable of executing the judicial office",2.0
the calgary trial made headlines around the world after it emerged that camp had repeatedly asked the 19 year old complainant why she hadn t done more to prevent the alleged rape why couldn t you just keep your knees together \? camp asked her later he told her that sex and pain sometimes go together,2.0
"throughout the trial , camp erroneously referred to her as the accused at one point he asked the complainant who said the alleged assault took place on a bathroom sink why she hadn t sunk her bottom down into the basin so he couldn t penetrate you",2.0

"the inquiry heard a remorseful camp apologise for his remarks i was not the good judge i thought i was , said the 64 year old camp , who was born in south africa and moved to calgary in 1998 , said he had not understood the changes made to canadian laws aimed at sheltering sexual assault complainants from discriminatory attitudes",2.0
"the inquiry also heard from the female complainant , who said camp s remarks had left her grappling with suicidal thoughts what did he get from asking that \? she asked he made me hate myself and he made me feel like i should have done something that i was some kind of slut",2.0
"on wednesday , the inquiry committee said camp s questions showed an antipathy towards laws designed to protect vulnerable witnesses , promote equality and bring integrity to sexual assault trials the judge , they added , also relied on discredited myths and stereotypes about women and victim blaming during the trial and in his reasons for judgment",2.0

"theresa may should unilaterally pass legislation to secure the rights of up to 3 million european union citizens to stay in britain or risk souring the tone of the brexit talks , according to labour s keir starmer",2.0
the shadow brexit secretary said may should act immediately and abandon her increasingly controversial position of refusing to make any concession over the rights of eu citizens in the uk without securing equivalent guarantees for the 1 2 million uk citizens living elsewhere in the eu,2.0
"it s becoming increasingly apparent to me from my discussions in brussels with those that are likely to be involved in the negotiations that they are very concerned about the fact that we are not giving comfort and status to their citizens , he told the guardian",2.0
"they have said to me , pretty well in terms , the uk should sort this out before march , and that would ensure that the article 50 negotiations got off to a much better start than they will otherwise do",2.0
"relations between the uk and the rest of the eu have become increasingly heated on the topic on tuesday the european council president , donald tusk , published a strongly worded letter to a group of conservative mps saying the issue would have to wait for formal negotiations to begin and appeared to blame the british electorate for causing the uncertainty in the first place",2.0
"starmer described tusk s letter as unhelpful , but said it points to the need to act unilaterally now , and is further evidence of the unhelpful atmosphere that has been created in the lead up to the negotiations",2.0
in his letter tusk added the only way to dispel the fears and doubts of all citizens concerned is the quickest possible start of the negotiations based on article 50 of the treaty,2.0
"but starmer , the mp for holborn and st pancras in london , said the government should take more urgent action as a goodwill gesture before formal talks begin everywhere you go there is a mounting sense of very real injustice i think everybody feels it it s across parties , and it can t be left unresolved any longer",2.0
"at prime minister s questions on wednesday , may defended her approach she said i think the reaction that we have seen shows it was absolutely right for us not to do what the labour party wanted us to do , which was simply to give away the guarantee for rights of eu citizens here in the uk as we have seen , that would have left uk citizens in europe high and dry",2.0
"the government has suggested the vast majority of those eu citizens already living in the uk are likely to be entitled to apply for permanent residence , because they have been here for more than five years but starmer said that could be a bureaucratic and unwieldy process and could overwhelm the resources of the home office he added that permanent residence was an eu concept , which would be expected to fall away when britain leaves",2.0
"instead , he suggested the government could pass a domestic law , dealing with the status of these individuals , and it would get cross party support , and could be passed very swiftly",2.0
he added at the very least there ought to be clarity for those who were already here on 23 june,2.0
"the bad blood between london and brussels over the future of eu citizens was indicative of a wider problem with the tone the government had adopted as it approached the coming negotiations , starmer claimed , warning about mixed messages from london",2.0
"he contrasted may s conservative party conference speech , widely interpreted as signalling she favoured hard brexit , with reassurances subsequently given to nissan about continued access to the single market",2.0
"it s very difficult to suggest that what may said at conference and the nissan assurance are the same thing , and so mixed messages are being received in brussels that is not healthy",2.0
"he added that the sometimes jocular tone of the foreign secretary , boris johnson , risked offending his eu counterparts they perceive an arrogance on behalf of the uk , and boris johnson may think he s very amusing in his approach , but my perception is our eu partners are not in the mood for that kind of amusement he added we need to make sure that the tone is right",2.0
"with just four months to go until may s self imposed end of march deadline for triggering article 50 , starmer said he believed there was still a tussle within the government about what kind of relationship with the eu it wanted to aim at when negotiations began",2.0
"i think they haven t come to a final view , and that is because the argument about europe that has been going on for years in the tory party has broken out like never before , he said it s become an argument about the very future of our country",2.0
"labour s own stance on brexit has sometimes appeared less than unanimous , and senior party figures have told the guardian that starmer himself one of the highest profile promotions when jeremy corbyn refilled his frontbench after the summer leadership challenge is being man marked",2.0
"he underlined corbyn s insistence that the party would not seek to block the triggering of article 50 but did not rule out amending any legislation the government brings to parliament , to force may to reveal more about her negotiating stance",2.0
"we won t frustrate the process , but we do want to put some grip and grit into the process , to ensure that parliament and the public know the prime minister s starting position , he said asked if that could mean labour tabling amendments to any bill , he said so long as it doesn t frustrate the process , then it is important to look at options",2.0
"asked whether brexit presented enormous opportunities , as the shadow chancellor , john mcdonnell , recently said , starmer replied i think there are huge risks in brexit and i see the task of the labour party as being to ensure that we get the best possible outcome that works for everybody in the uk",2.0
"he also struck a somewhat different tone from the shadow home secretary , diane abbott , on how labour should tackle voters concerns about immigration",2.0
starmer crisscrossed the country earlier this year as shadow immigration minister a job abbott has not taken on herself alongside the home affairs brief,2.0
"abbott used a recent interview to insist that labour must champion the benefits of immigration , or risk becoming ukip lite",2.0
"starmer said it was right to praise the contribution of migrants to britain s economy and society but he said hundreds of conversations across the north east , north west , east and wales had convinced him that labour needs to have a better answer for those that are concerned about immigration",2.0
"i don t think we can hide from that , and don t think frankly it was just the referendum i think this has been a growing issue for five or 10 years , and it s an issue on which labour needs to get on the front foot , and off the back foot , and that means we have got to listen to what people are telling us are their concerns",1.0
"abbott and the shadow business secretary , clive lewis , have suggested that boosting trade union rights to enhance workers bargaining power and prevent wages being undercut could help allay voters concerns",2.0
but starmer insisted the party should also develop new policies on integrating different ethnic groups an issue likely to be tackled in a forthcoming review by louise casey,2.0
"there is a big labour market element to it of course , starmer said , but he added i do think there is a wider piece about how our communities live together , and we ensure that integration works in a way that benefits everybody , and by that i mean as much those arriving as those who are already here",2.0
"that s a debate that labour have not engaged in at all really over recent years and we shouldn t be scared of this territory in a sense , we don t want to hear what people are saying to us we just sort of move the conversation on and my concern is labour are not seen to be listening on this , and we need to be",2.0

the latest attempt by tobacco companies to prevent the introduction of mandatory plain packaging of cigarettes in the uk has been rejected by the court of appeal,2.0
"the judgment is a fresh blow to companies who face having to replace their current heavily branded distinctive packs with boxes that are indistinguishable from each other bar the brand name on the packet in standard typeface , colour and size",2.0
"the regulations aim to reduce the appeal and uptake of smoking , by children and young people in particular , help smokers to quit , prevent misleading packaging , and give greater prominence to health warnings",2.0
"but british american , imperial , japan international and philip morris claim that the move would infringe their human and intellectual property rights",2.0
"in may , the high court rejected their arguments , the day before the tobacco products directive of the eu took effect some of the companies took the case to the court of appeal last month but , on wednesday , the three judges , sitting at the royal courts of justice in central london , dismissed the challenge",2.0
"lord justice lewison , lord justice beatson and sir stephen richards ruled that the health secretary had lawfully exercised his powers",2.0
the companies now have the option of appealing to the supreme court,2.0
"nicola blackwood , the public health and innovation minister , said standardised packaging will help cut smoking rates and reduce suffering , disease and loss of life we are pleased that this decision will help many people to lead longer and healthier lives",2.0
"since may , legal challenge notwithstanding , companies have been forbidden from making packets that do not comply with the directive however , they are allowed to sell off existing cigarette stocks until may next year , which means plain packets will only emerge in the shops gradually",2.0
"the new packs will be the same shape , size and colour \( green \) and 65 of the front and back surfaces will be covered by picture health warnings , with written warnings on the sides",2.0
"deborah arnott , the chief executive of the health charity ash , said this is a victory for public health and another crushing defeat for the tobacco industry this ruling should also encourage other countries to press ahead with standardised packaging , now that the industry s arguments have yet again been shown to be without foundation",2.0
"simon clark , the director of the smokers group forest , said by stigmatising the product , the government is also targeting the user plain packs are unlikely to deter people from smoking but the impact on consumer choice could be significant because some brands will almost certainly disappear from the market",2.0

"i serve on the independent monitoring board at bedford jail where prisoners rioted this month for the past eight years i have visited the prison about once a week every prison in england and wales has an imb of ordinary citizens , appointed by the justice secretary in much the same way as are magistrates their voluntary job is to monitor whether prisons do what they say on the tin provide a safe and secure environment within which to help prisoners lead law abiding and useful lives in custody and after they are released members visit their prison unaccompanied and unannounced , and have unfettered access to it",2.0
"in august , the imb was so concerned for the safety of prisoners and staff that it took the unprecedented step of writing to the prisons minister , sam gyimah , asking for his urgent help",2.0
"hmp bedford is a small , busy jail that holds about 500 prisoners , both remanded from the courts in neighbouring towns and others whose sentence plans are still being worked out prior to their dispersal elsewhere it is located in the town centre , with excellent communications for staff and prisoners families , a location that allows , in principle , for extensive partnerships and engagements with local communities but the antiquated buildings and facilities are desperately in need of renovation to make them fit for purpose \( typically two grown men living , sleeping , eating and relieving themselves in cells built ungenerously in 1850 for one man , now with an unscreened wc and basin in place of two tin buckets \)",2.0
"the imb s last two annual reports to the end of june 2015 and june 2016 warned that the jail was in need of infrastructural investment , overcrowded by as much as 50 , and perilously under staffed",2.0
"within prisons drugs , violence and merciless bullying are endemic the mix is toxic and threatening , a damaging punishment over and above the deprivation of liberty , autonomy and contact with your roots surely no judge intended such suffering when passing sentence \?",2.0
"some lessons were learned a decade before i started visiting prisons individuals need to be treated with decency , both because they are individual human beings and because rehabilitative efforts were shown to be futile in the absence of respect prisons can furthermore only be run economically by consent an implicit pact between prisoners and staff , which depends upon the prisoners perceiving the prison management s use of authority as having legitimacy decency thus has a crucial central place , in lock step with rehabilitation , in securing cost effectiveness",2.0
"the decency agenda has raised standards , but it requires continual attention which it has been often impossible to sustain in recent years as austerity has swept through the prison estate a series of savings driven restructuring programmes have lowered salaries , changed terms of employment , drastically reduced staffing levels and deskilled officers capital and maintenance budgets have been slashed governors autonomy has been progressively eroded , not least by a long series of expensive and quite possibly ill judged outsourcing contracts the impacts have been devastating , and form the backdrop to the riots at hmp bedford",2.0
"for prisons to deliver rehabilitation , on top of secure containment , there needs to be a decent , structured , calm and uncrowded environment sufficient numbers of committed staff who have the skill to go way beyond the \( already very difficult \) running of a safe jail , by working individually with every prisoner ample opportunities for prisoners to use their time constructively \( remedial and more ambitious education , training , work \) and consistently superlative leadership and dedication to purpose throughout the system by august this year , the cost cutting programmes of the last few years had bitten hard into hmp bedford many experienced staff members had left the service for better respected and remunerated employment , necessitating the deployment of inexperienced officers recruitment and retention difficulties , \( uncompetitive salaries set against the difficulty of the job \) and long term sickness were so serious that it was no longer possible to deliver the full range of required out of cell activities \( opportunites to socialise with other prisoners , shower , make telephone calls , exercise , education , work etc \) safely",2.0
"opportunities for prisoners to be involved in any constructive employment were already drastically reduced and were fast vanishing instead , prisoners locked in their cells often for up to 23 hours a day these unplanned and unannounced bang ups unsettled the prisoners as well as reinforcing their boredom staff shortages and rotations had become so severe that officers had insufficient time even to get to know the prisoners in their charge , let alone attend to their needs the use of drugs had spiralled , and with that trade , the bullying of the weak and vulnerable the incidence of self harm and of violent assaults , both prisoner on prisoner and prisoner on staff , was rising alarmingly",2.0
"there was increasing rumour of prisoner unrest the imb was hearing accounts from officers that they were becoming afraid to work on the prison s largest wing the imb letter to the minister warned that staff shortages were beyond crisis point and of the alarming rise in prisoners attempting to hang themselves in the 10 weeks between the posting of the letter and the minister s response , two prisoners were found hanged",2.0
"gyimah s reply , dated 27 october , however , was written very much in the register adopted for the minister s acknowledgement of the imb s annual report it gave airy explanations of how the ministry of justice \( moj \) agency , the national offender management service \( noms \) , and the senior prison officers were coping with the imb s concerns , while conveying nothing more urgent in intention than a pat on the head in effect , he was saying this is a prison ! if you can t stand the heat , keep out of the kitchen sorry to hear that it has made you anxious less than two weeks later , on sunday 6 november , the prison erupted in a widely reported riot involving more than 200 men from two wings the incident of concerted indiscipline stopped short of catastrophe because the officers on duty read the seriousness of the situation in time to withdraw , by degrees , and deprive the rioters both of hostages and keys because of the sang froid of the governor , as she took charge of the incident in the command suite and because the prisoners were intent more on making a protest than on blood this last may be a surprise to many , but i believe it to have been the case two residential wings and the central office and observation area were comprehensively trashed , nonetheless",2.0
"surveying the devastation a couple of days later , an imb colleague and i were approached by two experienced officers , who were plainly deeply affected by the riot they wanted us to see the graffiti versions of if you treat us like animals , we will eventually behave like animals , which implied that , at that moment , the prisoners and officers saw the prison in the same light these officers were acutely aware that the extreme working environment they had experienced for months was paralleled by the stress they had imposed on the desperate prisoners behind their emotion lay the cataclysmic loss of trust when this collapses , then all that you have worked to achieve seems to have failed the officers were devastated",2.0
"the prisoners involved in the riot have been sent , in small batches , to prisons across the country when they return , as many surely will \( they are essentially local men \) after the wings have been refurbished and the staffing problems have been resolved , i expect to hear similar deeply felt stories of betrayed trust from them , because there is never only one side to a story",2.0
"the inner turmoil experienced by the staff members on duty at the time of the riot has been debilitating they had to take the awful decision to withdraw , abandoning the prison and vulnerable prisoners the senior management team are racked with guilt that things came to this pass under their command",2.0
"many rioters will only have participated for fear of violent reprisals if they abstained , creating fear at the time and complicated long term consequences for them in the future even the instigators merit understanding of their circumstances , if not of their actions they may have been more hot headed than others , but the prisoners had collectively been driven to desperation by the poverty and randomness of the regime nonetheless , prisoners and staff connived , in a sense , to bring the insurrection under control before any mortal damage was done it is interesting that they left the library untouched",2.0
"it would be easy to attribute blame for the riot to the local actors , but that would represent a profound injustice and a failure to understand the horrors and complexities of prison the staff at all levels at hmp bedford have awed me by their consistent courage , loyalty , resilience , ready sense of decency and professionalism in the face of increasingly overwhelming odds this was evidenced over months of difficulty and in spades on the day of the riot when prisoners , having stoically endured a seemingly endlessly deteriorating and irregular regime , lost faith in the prison management s use of authority as having legitimacy , abandoned the implicit pact , and kicked off they had cried for help , as had the imb , the officers , and the governor to her superiors but no one at the top of the tree heard their pleas who , then , was blameworthy \?",2.0
"i arrive at the following conclusions the cost cutting demanded of noms , and , by extension , of individual prisons , has taken on the dimensions of an extreme human experiment , which in the social sciences these days would be blocked on ethical grounds there was no attempt to introduce these reforms gradually at a national level , or on a pilot basis , and then learn from the experience there was no evidence base for these reforms and no attempt to collect any they were thus driven purely by ideology and finance in general , the prison system seems reluctant to set up mechanisms whereby it can learn from its mistakes the trial has failed also because the premise upon which it was based is misconceived prisons are being asked to achieve the unachievable",2.0
"successive ministers have cut costs in the face of insistent warnings from many quarters , including the prison officers and the prison governors associations , the chief inspector of prisons , the imbs and the many prison reform lobbying organisations the only response has been about readjusting budgets over an extended period even though the new justice secretary , liz truss , has acknowledged \( in her recent white paper \) that cost cutting has driven prisons to an extreme where they are not even able to operate safely , no proportionate or urgent action has been taken by the politicians and top civil servants in the moj who are responsible for the crisis in prisons this is a devastating failure of accountability they must acknowledge responsibility for the damage done",2.0
"the recent prison riots are testimony to a slow burn build up of misery and conflict that has blighted the lives of the prison s many communities i would particularly highlight the intolerable burdens that have been placed on officers and managers , as this is seldom sufficiently recognised at last , it is being acknowledged that prisons cannot be reformed without high quality , motivated staff and this is not simply about having the money to pay them a decent salary \( although that is a necessary precondition \)",2.0
"staff members have to be assured that their contribution is valued and that they will be trained and supported to do a difficult job in a meaningful way , especially when they are in the early stages of their career most prison officers do not go into the service to bang people up , but to help people change making the job so mechanical that it loses its meaning has led to a situation where it is as difficult to retain staff as it is to recruit them",2.0
"criminal justice is a political playground , leading to endless changes in emphasis and policy prison budgets have not been ringfenced during austerity in consequence , we have massively overcrowded and under staffed older prisons , some of which are truly shocking , and that is unworthy of a nation that instinctively tends to assume it is a moral model for the rest of the world across the country , our prisons have failed to deliver against their social contract to reform offenders so systematically that it is unclear that prisons \( especially large ones \) can ever deliver this while the political climate remains as it is",2.0
"a new vision is needed with an emphasis on integrating and accessing the insight contained within the system , one such vision comprises three principal departures from current thinking first , sentencing guidance would change radically to substitute community penalties for imprisonment for the vast majority of offences for which research has shown that incarceration does not generally reduce reoffending second , there would be a properly resourced community sentence and probation service centre \( cspsc \) in every major town to provide offenders with support , advice , help with housing and employment , remedial education and vocational training , alongside traditional probation service functions third , integrated into these centres would be small and local prisons so that all but the few prisoners who need high security jails more security and with intensive support to live safely , remain close to their roots these new integrated centres would work most effectively if they formed a thriving and well connected part of local life",2.0
"and what of the future for hmp bedford \? its accessibility is such a huge asset that it merits the necessary investment , as long as the prison population is reduced to a level that allows it to offer personal attention , in a safe and calm environment overseen by an adequate number of experienced staff only then can a rehabilitative ethos have a chance to be effective",2.0

"zoe williams \( forget fidel castro s policies above all , he was a dictator , 28november \) bases her judgment of castro on a frighteningly simplistic division of states into democracies , by implication multiparty ones , and dictatorships , by implication any state that is not multiparty she then makes a blanket assertion that the latter are so inherently bad that their actual record of government is irrelevant this is to ignore all the complex details of political structures by which a population can be oppressed or empowered for us , from a practical point of view , the worst danger of such thinking is to exaggerate the benefits of our political system",2.0
"while castro may be rightly criticised for executing batista supporters , even those guilty of torture and multiple murder , it may be salutary to remember that back then , in 1959 , britain executed people accused of a single murder it was also a time when british forces were imprisoning and torturing kenyans , and those of the french multiparty democracy were torturing and killing algerians even those crimes pale before the horrors the us multiparty democracy was shortly to unleash on vietnam",2.0

there s a poverty gap where you can t afford civil litigation but don t qualify for public funding the equity in your house is taken into account in testing entitlement to legal aid,2.0
garsden added persuading the legal aid agency that your case has merit is a huge amount of work the special cases unit in brighton require you to prove everything and take nothing on trust some lawyers don t deal with legal aid because it requires so much effort,2.0
"jonathan bridge , a solicitor with the law firm farleys in manchester , said there are an increasingly large number of experts who will not work at legal aid rates they will not prepare reports at legal aid rates that s particularly a problem with adult and child psychiatrists",2.0
"dave enright , of the solicitors firm howe and co in london , said there was consequently a very small pool of practitioners he said it s badly paid the work is so complex and that s part of the barrier",2.0
"asked by counsel to the inquiry peter skelton qc whether that prevented access to justice , enright replied absolutely because there will be huge advice deserts around the country large parts of the country did not have local lawyers who are experts on abuse",2.0

"cases against institutions mostly date from the 1960s to the mid 1980s before foster care became more common what all survivors of abuse want is their day in court and to be believed and to be listened to , garsden said",2.0
"a further threat to litigation , the solicitors explained , is a new regime of fixed costs for all claims lord justice jackson has been commissioned to undertake a review of fixed recoverable costs , to be completed by july 2017 fixed cost regimes would render most of these cases unviable , garsden added",2.0
experts from the insurance world also gave evidence they denied that new policies were being produced that included exclusion clauses for claims involving sexual molestation,2.0

the frozen food retailer iceland is sending a high level delegation to reykjavik this week in an attempt to thaw relations with the icelandic government after it launched legal action against the chain over the use of its name,2.0

"the retailer s company secretary and legal director , duncan vaughan , will be leading the delegation in the next few days , but it will not include walker",2.0
walker said we registered iceland as our company name in 1970 and we have coexisted with the country called iceland very happily ever since they have made no contact with us to raise any concerns about trademark issues since 2012,2.0
"we have no desire whatsoever to stand in the way of iceland the country making use of their own name to promote their own products , so long as it does not conflict or cause confusion with our own business i am sure there is ample scope for an agreement that will allow both parties to continue to live and work amicably alongside each other",3.0
"the company , whose headquarters are in deeside , has more than 800 stores in the uk and employs more than 23 , 000 staff it holds a europe wide trademark registration for the word , and iceland the country is seeking to invalidate the registration on the basis that it is exceptionally broad and ambiguous in definition , often rendering the country s firms unable to describe their products as icelandic",2.0
"in a circular released last week , the government stated the government of iceland is concerned that our country s businesses are unable to promote themselves across europe in association with their place of origin a place of which we are rightly proud and enjoys a very positive national branding",2.0
"in an explanatory statement , the retailer added that it did not simply take its name from the nordic state , but has a long history of close and friendly involvement with the country",2.0
"for seven years from 2005 , iceland foods was under the control of icelandic investors and later icelandic banks this relationship came to an end with the 1 5bn management buyout of the company in 2012 , but iceland the company has continued to have a warm relationship with iceland the country through the ownership of three iceland stores there , export sales of iceland products to other retailers throughout the country , and sponsorship of the icelandic national team in this year s european football championships",2.0

"the ministry of justice \( moj \) would not disclose the number of magistrates who had resigned this year , but the association said the figure was considerable",2.0

"three magistrates who have resigned or retired since september told the guardian morale was at rock bottom among the judges , who are only paid expenses",2.0
"they said magistrates felt ignored and unappreciated as a result of cost cutting , ranging from court closures to buildings falling into disrepair more trivial money saving measures , such as cutting back on coffee and newspapers in the judges quarters , and using cheaper , thinner paper , had also irritated the magistracy , they said",2.0
"janet alcock , a conservative councillor in clitheroe , lancashire , said she resigned in despair in september after 20 years as a magistrate the role has been reduced to a soul destroying production line of speeding fines and licence fee evasions , alcock said , adding that she gave up encouraging people to become magistrates a long time ago",2.0
"alcock said she had become extremely frustrated at having to issue fines to defendants who would never be able to pay , and the victim surcharge , which just seems to be another way of dressing up that they re taking more money off them",2.0
"you know , realistically , from the point of view of collecting the fines , you re not going to get it , which makes it extremely frustrating , she said everybody s always calling me the hanging judge because i m saying things like instead of fining people who can t afford it , send them out working political correctness wouldn t allow you to do anything like that",2.0
"but that would be far more satisfying to the public , i think , than for people to appear six months later owing even more than they did at the beginning it s just frustrating for everybody",2.0
"myra robinson , who retired last month as a bench chairman of newcastle magistrates , said fining those who could not afford to pay was morally wrong , but there was little that magistrates could do about it it s just ticking boxes and following down if someone did this then that s the punishment there s no flexibility , she said",2.0
"i d worked all my career with young offenders and kids with problems i felt i knew a lot of the families with problems in newcastle , and i could see behind what they d just done and think what would be an appropriate way of dealing with it my hands have been tied for many years now people can t afford fines",2.0
"a third recently resigned magistrate , who did not want to be named , said the court closures meant losing local justice for local people in some cases , proposed closures meant it would be impossible for defendants or witnesses travelling by public transport to get to a court for 10am",2.0
"i was constantly getting emails or texts or phone calls to say that we urgently need magistrates to sit in places like scarborough that would imply there is a shortage , said the magistrate , who was based nearly 90 miles \( 145km \) away in halifax , west yorkshire",2.0
"forty seven magistrates courts closed their doors between march and september under government proposals to reduce the 500m annual cost of the courts estate a further 45 are due to shut by september 2017 , meaning one fifth of all courts in england and wales will have disappeared in 19 months",2.0

"but due to poor medical support , the people begging on lagos s street are disproportionately made up of mentally ill and disabled citizens , and human rights activists say tens of thousands of vulnerable people have been detained over the past five years as a result of the ban",2.0
"megan chapman , a human rights lawyer and director of the local ngo justice and empowerment initiatives \( jei \) , said the scale of human rights violations is massive and extremely concerning , and added the treatment may be illegal under the country s constitution",2.0
"though campaigners from jei acknowledged that begging is also banned in other cities across the world , they claim the ban is policed brutally and without transparency in lagos it s hard to find a city enforcing the ban in as inhumane a way as lagos is , chapman said",2.0
"despite widespread calls from ngos and activists for the state to reconsider its policy , the nigerian senate is now considering a bill to ban begging nationwide",2.0
"the bill , proposed by senator isah misau , has substantial backing in the senate , with lawmakers claiming the increase in begging is caused by criminal exploitation rather than poor economic conditions in nigeria , which is now officially in recession",2.0
"speaking in support of the proposed legislation , misau said street begging affects not only the geographical and social structure of urban areas it also portrays the country in a bad light to tourists and foreign visitors",2.0
"lagos state s governor , akinwunmi ambode , has backed the crackdown on street begging we ve had security reports on the activities of persons who pose as beggars , especially in traffic , but their sole aim is to perpetrate evil , he said in july",2.0
"the state government said in april that 1 , 340 beggars , destitute and mentally challenged persons had been rescued from the streets of lagos in the past year during this period , it said 590 rehabilitees had been released and reunited with their relatives for re integration , while 1 , 228 people were rehabilitated at what it referred to as a rehabilitation and training centre in majidun , on mainland lagos",2.0
"in addition , according to a leaked memo cited on the nigerian site pm news , 413 beggars and lunatics were reportedly evacuated from lagos s streets by government officials between march and july this year",2.0
"most of those detained for begging are taken to the holding facility by the so called rescue team from the lagos state youth and development ministry , which enforces the ban",2.0
"the centre was opened as part of a drive to clean up the city in the 1970s state officials claim it is used to help and treat beggars and people who are physically or mentally ill , yet reports from former detainees paint a different picture",2.0
"men and women held there have described torturous conditions , claiming to have been denied basic rights and medical attention , held in confined spaces , often for years , without a fair hearing",2.0
"we have met dozens of people arrested for begging who have been made to pay a hefty bribe , who have been deprived of their liberty for months or even years not one of them has ever been taken before a court of law it is a serious violation of their rights under the nigerian constitution , she said",2.0
what we ve been pressing the state government to do is to have a root and branch overhaul of the system stop the mass incarcerations that impact on the health and well being of the beggars,2.0
"workers from jei , along with the physically challenged empowerment initiative \( pcei \) , a grassroots organisation campaigning against the detentions , have looked after several people after their release from the centre",2.0
"among them was 25 year old yakubu idris after his arrest and 20 month detention at the majidun facility , his health deteriorated interviewed hours after his release , he said now i cannot walk i cannot even stand up from the floor",2.0
"despite suffering from extensive infections and a respiratory problem , idris said he was denied medical treatment by officials at the facility in the cell i totally forgot how long i was there because i was never let out then one day theoga boss took two of us and released us , he said",2.0
"a week later , tests for tuberculosis came back positive , but idris died before he could receive treatment",2.0
"chapman said calls for change by local ngos were slowly being heeded , but the proposed bill threatened to undermine years of work to change attitudes towards beggars",2.0
"we have pointed out that current practices are completely unconstitutional and fail to address the social problems of destitution and street begging the focus should be on helping the poor and people living with disabilities to find alternative livelihoods , she said",2.0
"under the previous lagos state governor , scores of beggars were routinely deported to their states of origin in 2011 , 3 , 029 people were deported from lagos dolapo badru , a state government spokesman at the time , defended the measures , arguing that beggars and destitutes constitute a social nuisance towards the development of lagos as a mega city",2.0
"muhammed zanna , one of the founders of the pcei in lagos said negative perceptions of the poor had led to widespread apathy about the way they are treated by the state",2.0
"governor ambode wants to create a modern city and the poor don t fit into that vision , said zanna",2.0
"the state doesn t see beggars as real people , just as people to hide or to send away people who have no interaction with the poor or disabled have this idea that they are really criminals and drug dealers , so even when the state services maltreats them people don t show any concern , zanna said",2.0
state officials at the youth ministry did not respond to requests for comment,2.0
"officials at the facility in majidun denied detainees were kept in harsh conditions indefinitely or denied basic rights , and claimed a doctor was available to provide treatment they also say it is merely a temporary holding site until fines are paid or a hearing takes place",2.0
"forty year old binta muhammadu was arrested in february with her two children , aged two and four when she couldn t pay the fine , she was detained at majidun for nine months , with her children held elsewhere in that time i only saw my children three times , she said",2.0
"according to binta , there were about 50 of us in the same room , where we bathed , ate and slept we were never let out , she said",2.0
"i don t know what i will do now that i am free , she added i don t have anything and i can t walk well any more this has just made things worse for me than it was before",2.0

"at the heart of the latest allegations swirling around george brandis , the chronically dysfunctional first law officer , is the claim that he failed in his duty to protect the constitution and the revenue in order to perform a favour to political soulmates in the government of western australia",2.0
"that was what the west australian newspaper said on friday , in a useful article that tied together some of the loose strands still flapping in the wake of brandis entanglement with the former solicitor general , justin gleeson",2.0
if the allegation is true then it would be unconscionable for brandis to remain attorney general,2.0
"it was asserted by the paper that brandis instructed the solicitor general not to run an argument in the high court on behalf of the commissioner of taxation that would jeopardise legislation passed by the western australian parliament to close down the long running bell litigation , where creditors were fighting over the carve up of assets from the carcass of alan bond s corporate interests",2.0
"instead of lawyers in court scrapping over money , the wa government wanted to take control and arrange its own scheme of distribution this was of immediate concern to the commissioner of taxation , who was in line for 300m in unpaid bell taxes and concerned that he would be at the mercy of bureaucrats in perth",2.0
"the bell act sought to alter , impair and detract from the commonwealth s ability to enforce the recovery of a tax debt",2.0
gleeson thought it was constitutional law 101 that the wa legislation ran foul of the conflict of laws provision of the constitution,2.0
"the taxation commission sought the solicitor general s advice and was told there was an excellent chance the high court would find what the law men from the wild west had done was invalid , which it duly found in may this year",2.0
"brandis made a statement to the senate on monday , where for all the world he looked like a man whose career was balanced on eggshells he said it was absurd for the opposition to say that he had failed sufficiently to protect the interests of the commonwealth",2.0
"there are a couple of things to note about those dates the ato intervened in the high court case on 8 march , while brandis only allowed the commonwealth to get its foot in the door six days before the argument kicked off in the high court on 5 april",2.0
"one possible explanation for this delay was that the attorney general was trying to keep faith with the western australian liberals , by at least staying the commonwealth s hand , even though the ato had independently decided to press ahead",2.0
"it was only when gleeson came to see the attorney general sometime before 30 march , to insist that the commonwealth should intervene in the litigation that the government s senior lawyers got the green light to be involved",2.0
brandis has tried to suggest that the commonwealth didn t need to get involved because the commissioner of taxation had mounted his horse,2.0
"one other thing it doesn t wash for him to claim that the letters between hockey and the wa treasurer , mike nahan , are not evidence of an agreement between the state and federal government if anything , hockey s letter gives the western australians a great big , gleaming green light to press ahead with their bell legislation all the commonwealth treasurer was concerned about was ensuring australia is an attractive destination for foreign investment here s hockey",2.0
we actually have to go to the high court transcripts to get further and better particulars as to what went on,2.0
"on 8 february , seven weeks before the commonwealth intervened in the litigation , there was a directions hearing in the high court",2.0
"dr james watson , instructed by the australian government solicitor , appeared and told justice virginia bell",2.0
one implication of what watson told the court on 8 february was that the ag was still to decide on something he had in contemplation yet the senate was told that the first that brandis had any personal involvement was 3 march,2.0
this is something that any inquiry by a senate committee might tease out,2.0
"the alternative position is that the government solicitor was acting without the attorney general s knowledge , which stretches incredulity when it comes to a control freak like george brandis , particularly in a high profile piece of politically sensitive litigation",2.0
on the same day \( 8 february \) barrister anthony d arcy appeared for the bell plaintiffs and said that his clients wanted a special case that embraced the legislation s inconsistencies with both the tax act and the corporations act,2.0
"in other words , while brandis later indicated he was chewing his fingernails about whether it was preferable to engage the tax act argument alone , the plaintiffs seven weeks earlier were pressing for an all in case that included the corporations act",2.0
the questions that brandis statement to parliament did not answer are these,2.0
"a casual observer might think that protecting the commonwealth s interests would involve getting on the bus from day one , not three weeks after the tax office was on the case and seven weeks after the ags lawyers told the court the ag has not yet made the decision to intervene",2.0
"then there is the timing of the 4 may super duper legal services direction , which required all government agencies \( including the commissioner of taxation \) to seek the attorney general s approval before running off and getting advice from gleeson the attorney issued that direction 12 days before the high court handed down its decision",2.0
all very puzzling no doubt justin gleeson could clear up the confusion if he was asked to give evidence to another performance of the legal and constitutional affairs committee,2.0
"in the meantime , the lawyers can get back to feasting on the 25 year banquet that is the bell creditors litigation",2.0

"the regime at the category c hindley jail near wigan is one of the worst and possibly one of the very worst that inspectors had ever seen in this type of prison , an official watchdog report has said",2.0
"the chief inspector of prisons , peter clarke , said the hindley regime includes regular shutdowns when inmates , including young adults , are locked in their cells for more than 24 hours at a time",2.0
"his report published on tuesday also highlights poor food , including mouldy bread , filthy cells , and a high level of violence with 126 assaults in just six months , including 35 fights half the prisoners told inspectors it was easy to get hold of illegal drugs , which were more accessible than clean clothes , sheets or books from the library",2.0
"peter dawson , the director of the prison reform trust , said although they were used to dreadful inspection reports about dilapidated , overcrowded victorian prisons , hmp hindley is none of these things , and this damning verdict is all the more troubling as a result",2.0
"the latest critical inspection report comes after peers in the house of lords cited the record level of prison suicides so far this year justice ministers responded by acknowledging the seriousness of the crisis and highlighting their plans to recruit 2 , 500 more prison officers , including 400 immediately for the 10 most challenged prisons",2.0
hindley in greater manchester opened in 1961 as a borstal and in 2015 was converted from a youth jail into a category c prison for young offenders and adult males serving sentences of up to four years,2.0
"the inspection was carried out in july , when the jail held 515 inmates and was within its operational capacity",2.0
but the inspectors found a totally inadequate regime in which more than two thirds of prisoners said they received less than six hours a day out of their cells and many experienced less than that on a daily basis,2.0
"the inadequate regime was made worse by significant slippage and regular shutdowns , which meant that most prisoners regularly experienced being locked in their cells for more than 24 hours as a result , prisoners were often not unlocked to attend work or education , and were denied daily access to showers and telephones , the report said",2.0
"residential wings and landings were dirty , with inspectors finding mould and fungus , while single cells were small and poorly ventilated , and many were filthy",2.0
"the regime at hindley was one of the worst , and possibly the very worst , that inspectors had ever seen in this type of prison , said clarke the length of time for which young adults and adults alike were locked up was , in our considered view , unnecessary , unjustifiable and counterproductive almost every aspect of prison life was adversely affected by the regime",2.0
he cited the problem of the staff association opposing a move to put microwaves on the wings as symptomatic of what seemed to have gone wrong at hindley he said many prisoners locked up all day only received a hot meal at 4pm and were given an inadequate breakfast pack to see them through to lunchtime the next day a move to install microwaves would have been an improvement but good intentions were not being translated into action on the wings,2.0
"he added to make progress , there needs to be a very clear recognition of what is good at hindley , and also where there needs to be fundamental change many examples of good practice could be found in the chaplaincy , education and healthcare the same could not be said for residential areas there needs to be an honest appraisal of the culture that predominates among some staff in these areas",2.0
"michael spurr , the chief executive of the national offender management service , said since the inspection a detailed improvement plan had been developed to address the weaknesses identified by inspectors",2.0
"progress has been made to improve safety and purposeful activity with more prisoners engaged in high quality work and training opportunities , said spurr",2.0
additional staff have been transferred into the prison to support the improvements required and the governor is working closely with greater manchester police to tackle gang behaviour and violence in the prison,2.0

"for the past four months , turkey s leader has subjected his country to sweeping political purges but there are few signs of an end soon the new announcement that 6 , 000 teachers will be reinstated in their jobs after having been suspended is a welcome gesture but does little to reduce the level of tension",2.0
"since the mid july failed coup attempt against recep tayyip erdo an s regime , the president has orchestrated what amounts to a counter coup what mr erdo an sees as a clean up of the turkish body politic looks like the biggest purge in turkey s modern history more than 125 , 000 people have been dismissed or suspended and around 40 , 000 others arrested amnesty says there are credible reports of detainees being subjected to beatings and torture , including rape judges , military personnel and professors have lost their jobs",2.0
"while democracy should not have been usurped by the military , there are justifiable concerns about where mr erdo an is going a state of emergency allows him to rule by decree those affected are opponents of the ruling ak party kurdish activist groups and people suspected of links to the fetullah g len network find themselves bracketed with isis militants media freedom has been dramatically crushed on 12 november the executive director of the pro democracy newspaper cumhuriyet was detained nine of its journalists had already been arrested",2.0
"turkey s western allies are alarmed , but against a complex geopolitical backdrop , they have chosen discretion rather than valour after the eu parliament last week voted to freeze eu accession talks with turkey , mr erdo an lashed out by threatening to open the country s borders to migrants heading to europe this is tantamount to blackmail if the president made good it would collapse the eu turkey deal negotiated by angela merkel which saw ankara agree to take back refugees in exchange for billions in aid , ease travel restrictions for turks and refresh eu membership talks the hope in european capitals is that mr erdo an will not want to destroy the agreement visa free travel to europe remains a popular prospect for turks",2.0
"by fanning nationalist sentiment , mr erdo an wants to reach his long held goal of changing the turkish constitution in a way that would enlarge and concentrate powers in the presidency one proposal would see mr erdogan in office until 2029 but both the eu and turkey s strongman appear to suffer from a bout of magical thinking there is currently no consensus in europe for further rapprochement with a regime whose authoritarianism is blatantly on the rise nor is mr erdo an ready to abandon the leverage he publicly claims to have with european governments the lifting of visas hinges on turkey rescinding the anti terrorism legislation , which mr erdo an uses to repress dissent and he shows no appetite of giving up an october deadline came and went , with no progress whatsoever",2.0
"no one , whether in brussels or ankara , is ready to cut off talks the stalemate plays to both sides interests this might change if mr erdo an reintroduces the death penalty , as he has threatened to the eu has said this would end accession talks meanwhile , the grinding machine of political repression continues in turkey , whose rapprochement with vladimir putin s russia has become a stark new feature of its foreign policy with western allies left to contemplate their lack of sway",2.0

"harsh personal attacks on judges are bad for democracy and in danger of diminishing the independence of the judiciary , the former deputy president of the supreme court has warned",2.0
"in a forceful defence of the court s justices ahead of next week s pivotal article 50 appeal hearing , lord hope , who retired in 2013 , said recent attacks had gone far beyond legitimate criticism",2.0
"he revealed that a scheduled speech about the law and europe by a supreme justice , lord mance , had to be cancelled because of heightened political sensitivity over the european union and brexit",2.0
"his comments come in the wake of a daily mail front page that branded the three high court judges who decided the article 50 case enemies of the people and media attacks on the supreme court president , lord neuberger , and the deputy president , lady hale",2.0
"things have been happening which have made the lives of those wishing to come into the judiciary much less free , hope told a meeting hosted by the centre right thinktank policy exchange we run the risk of a diminished judiciary as a result recently the criticism has been taken too far and there have been harsh personal attacks",2.0
"hope said he had suffered from wounding personal attacks in the past it s bad for democracy , he added every lecture given by members of the supreme court and even sentences are being taken out of context",2.0
supreme court judges do give and publish lectures as part of their public role this excessive criticism runs the risk of closing things down at least one lecture lord mance s was taken out in case it excites that sort of comment,2.0
"the supreme court will next week hear the appeal by the government against the high court ruling that only parliament , as opposed to ministers , has the authority to trigger article 50 of the treaty on the european union , which will formally start the uk s withdrawal from the eu",2.0
"in recognition of the unprecedented case s constitutional importance , 11 supreme court justices will hear the arguments",2.0
"addressing the policy exchange meeting , the former editor of the daily telegraph , charles moore , called on neuberger and hale to recuse themselves and stand down from the bench because of their alleged impartiality",2.0
he accused hale of giving a detailed speech on the issues in the article 50 case before hearing it and of introducing new questions about potential parliamentary procedure which had not been discussed in the high court case moore also said pro european tweets by neuberger s wife constituted political activity,2.0
"judges , moore said , were traditionally considered to be the guardians of the constitution and the lions under the throne have they now become snakes in the grass \? , he asked",2.0
"the great majority of judges are very pro human rights and pro europe , he added is there enough diversity of opinion on the supreme court \? they should be independent of one another or is it group think \?",2.0
"the former home secretary and conservative party leader , michael howard , accused hale of getting her retaliation in first by delivering a speech ahead of the case it was wholly undesirable , he said",2.0
"although the brexit case was not an example of judicial overreach , lord howard said there was evidence of a judicial grab for power since judges are unaccountable it would be monstrous if criticism of the judiciary were to be curtailed it s of the utmost importance that the judiciary should not be immune from robust criticism , he said",2.0
"responding to attacks on the justices , a supreme court spokesperson said the role of the justices is to consider the points of law presented to them impartially , and to fulfil their judicial oath in reaching a decision according to the law no evidence has been presented that would suggest any justice of the supreme court has compromised their ability to fulfil that duty",2.0
"in statements earlier this month , the court defended neuberger and hale a court spokesperson said justices spouses are fully entitled to express personal opinions , including on issues of the day lady neuberger s passing comments on twitter have absolutely no bearing on lord neuberger s ability to determine the legal questions in this case impartially , according to the law of the land",2.0
"in relation to hale s speech , a supreme court spokesperson said lady hale was simply presenting the arguments from both sides of the article 50 appeal in an impartial way for an audience of law students , as part of a wider lecture on constitutional law it is entirely proper for serving judges to set out the arguments in high profile cases to help public understanding of the legal issues , as long as it is done in an even handed way",2.0
"one of the questions raised in these proceedings is what form of legislation would be necessary for parliament to be able to lawfully trigger article 50 , if the government loses its appeal a number of politicians have raised the same question though it was not dealt with explicitly in the high court judgment , it is not a new issue in no way was lady hale offering a view on what the likely outcome might be",2.0

the british government is facing a new legal challenge over whether it should seek to retain membership of the single market during the brexit process,2.0

"but it needn t be like this , in fact when asked about fun in childhood , most adults talk about family as the most significant factor in their having fun so here are seven sure fire ways to ensure fun festivities with the family",3.0
"fun is social , families are social families are tight knit units where members are assumed to have a good time with one another however , they are full of characters who know each other well and often familiarity breeds contempt but rather than getting annoyed at the foibles of family members , revel in them enjoy the bizarre interactions you can make a game of such idiosyncrasies by playing family eccentricities bingo , where a bingo card listing things that people always say or do is given out to everyone on christmas eve the objective is to fill the card by boxing day the winner gets to choose the route of the ever popular boxing day bracing walk",3.0
"fun is often vicarious much of the fun we have is when others are having fun this is never more evident than at christmas , where the fun can deteriorate as the day wears on particularly when the kids have been up since 3 30am to avoid this , make sure you pay attention to the fun of others that can be in ensuring that everyone is happy or content they needn t necessarily be having fun , but you will be",3.0
"fun and funny aren t the same thing when christmas is going well , the house is full of laughter however , fun and funny are different things be careful that laughter is not directed towards one or two people consistently fun happens when people feel part of a group , and laughter can be a means of exclusion , even if it is not intended to be this means paying attention to what we say and how we say it and this needs care and a certain degree of management",3.0
"fun is contextual think in advance of the situations in which your family tends to have fun it is tempting to suggest things to do at christmas because they always happen but if nobody really enjoys a nice board game , why insist everyone play one \? you can be imaginative about the ways in which some things your family do well can be accentuated if you are in a family of show offs , do things that allow people to show off if your family is less gregarious , think how individual family members can feel included , but the key is that things are done together",3.0
"much fun is had through repetition for many of us , tradition plays a significant role at christmas particularly important for children make the most of your family traditions perhaps invent new ones talking about the past is often fun and there are family stories that get told and retold make sure you make time for conversations about christmases past the children love hearing about their family in bygone years and older family members will love telling you all about it again",3.0
"but be relaxed about spontaneity many people find fun takes them by surprise and being spontaneous is important this does not sit comfortably with many of our experiences of the festive season christmases are often planned with military precision , but it can be liberating to imagine that not all of the plans need happen if something else fun is going on treat the plans as a guide that will be partially met as long as everyone is having fun , the overall objective is met mission accomplished",3.0
"turn off the screens other people are at the heart of our fun at christmas the temptation is to concentrate on the material stuff presents and increasingly this means screens however , the christmases we remember fondly are full of happy times talking and laughing with those close to us",3.0

"i was in a local pub recently when i overheard a lament about christmas opening hours contrary to what you may hear in the archers or see in eastenders , many british pubs now close on christmas day the man at the bar was clearly troubled where was he to go on 25 december \? the landlord who was obviously looking forward to putting his feet up on christmas day said there were quite a few websites that would tell you which nearby pubs were staying open , but i could see his regular was troubled not only was this the pub where he had always drunk on christmas day , but he had suddenly lost his surrogate family and at the most vulnerable time of year",3.0
"depending on your circumstances , christmas day can be a nightmare it is up there with valentine s day if you are unhappily single , and mother s day and father s day if your children aren t speaking to you you can t pretend it is just another day and simply get on with your life everyone and everything is telling you it s christmas day even the queen gets in on the act there are few worse days to be on your own it happened to me 14 years ago",3.0
"newly divorced and with a lovely new flat in a new city , i stood at my picture window and watched a family grandparents , mother , daughter and dog going for a bracing post lunch walk seeing them striding out , with an ecstatic dog and a young daughter in new gloves and coat rushing ahead , i remember thinking , i m like you i m sure if you met me , we d get on but i knew i couldn t nip down , introduce myself and say , i m all alone on christmas day can i walk with you \? they would have called the little girl over and put her safely between the mother and grandmother until the strange , sad man went on his way",3.0
"i wasn t entirely alone in the world that day on christmas eve , i had taken my children to their grandparents and we had opened presents over breakfast on christmas morning and then i had driven them to their mother s and come back to my flat",3.0
"at first , i felt like matt damon as the talented mr ripley having his solitary christmas in rome i unwrapped my presents , ate and drank some special things i had saved up for the big day i may even have watched the talented mr ripley i certainly fell asleep at one point in best post prandial style",3.0
"but when i woke up and walked to the window and saw that family , it hit me that here i was , in my late 40s , and life had only ever prepared me for christmas day with family , not to spend it on my own i had been enjoying the single life up until that moment",3.0
"for many people who are on their own at christmas , there are surrogate families going to church or helping out at a refuge can supply a sense of community , but as we lose pubs that offer open house on christmas day , we are losing the kind of family that many single men crave , the kind of benign family where you can drop in and chat , or keep to yourself but still feel welcomed by fellow human beings",3.0
"so how do we cope , we men who are looking at being on our own on christmas day \? i address this question deliberately to men because i am one and can t really speak to the female experience although i have always felt that women have more effective support groups than men but that is only because we have none",3.0
it is a question of attitude my overwhelmingly strong feeling was that i needed a family on christmas day but christmas doesn t have to be about families that was my mistake,3.0
"when i think back to the talented mr ripley , christmas day is presented as the moment of perfect stillness in tom ripley s turbulent life in his rome apartment , he plays the piano and sits by the fire opening a present that he has bought himself and that he clearly loves yet it is not the present , the music , or even the glass of wine he sips , that makes this moment special , it s the stillness the world stands still on christmas day this stillness , at a point when the planet feels as if it has ceased to turn and we will remain in the depths of a silent winter for ever is a great moment to recharge our spiritual batteries",3.0
"looking back , i see it was a mistake to gaze longingly at that family out on its bracing walk i should have been enjoying the calm of a christmas afternoon entirely on my own , rather than wishing it away i was outside family life for the first time and , instead of appreciating the wonderful silence , i wanted to get back into family life as soon as i could",3.0
"the funny thing is , exactly 12 months later i drove my children from their grandparents to their mother and , instead of driving back to my flat , i drove on to devon with the m5 entirely to myself \( a very odd experience that quickly convinces you that zombies have taken over \) when i got to bideford , there was the family i was going to marry in to three months later there were grandparents , there was my fiancee , there was her nine year old daughter and there was the dog",3.0
"i don t quite know how i managed it they can t have been the family i saw walking that christmas afternoon , but it was strange how what i got for that christmas was exactly what i had craved the year before",3.0
"but my point is not that if you wish for something hard enough , you will get it the world is full of people who have wished hard and been desperately disappointed no , my point is that if you are alone without a family this christmas day don t wish it away but see if , like tom ripley , you can enjoy it i think you can",3.0

"the first of the three fathers that nicky loutit remembers is robert kee he had been a fighter pilot and prisoner of war , and later became a writer , broadcaster and member of the famous five who founded tv am he was handsome , charismatic and angry",3.0
"aged two and a half , nicky was put in a children s home by her mother , janetta , who is now 95 she said to me recently that she knew i didn t like that home , but she was so mad about robert that she put me there for my own protection , says nicky she felt she was saving me i remember crying and crying and crying still now , it makes me cry if i d talked about it 10 years ago , i probably wouldn t have cried getting older , says nicky , now 73 , she feels more tender",3.0
"nicky is a painter who has produced a unique and haunting memoir , in pictures and words , of her extraordinary childhood it reveals a trio of fathers who were highly regarded figures in public , but who , in private , variously inflicted on her mental , physical or sexual abuse",3.0
"she is upset when we meet because an event to promote her book has been marketed as , come and meet nicky loutit , the sexually abused child from the london elite her publisher points out that this is all true i don t remotely feel i am an abused child of the cultural elite , says nicky the book is more about an old person remembering ghastly things and the emergence of exquisite beauty",3.0
"then again , she recognises the possibility that her distress about the event is a form of denial i m astonished at the power of denial even when i was little , teachers might say , i understand you re from a broken home i was like , that s fine no self indulgence and nobody is special was what i picked up from my mother and her friends i was in constant pain , but i didn t recognise it i had this wonderful act , acting cool , and it was gross denial gross denial gave me the strength to get through",3.0
"nicky was the first child of janetta slater , a beautiful young bohemian woman who mixed with leftwing artists and writers of 1940s and 50s london kee , george orwell and the literary critic cyril connolly unsurprisingly , given connolly s famous dictum about the pram in the hall being an enemy of good art , nicky felt unwanted , an impediment to the creative high achievers around her that s what made me so vulnerable to being abused , she says i was desperate to be some use , in some way",3.0
"when janetta fell in love with kee in the late 1940s , nicky , her daughter by another man , was in the way nicky genuinely can t remember if kee pushed her down the stairs , but she had a terror of stairs as child he used to get hold of me and violently shake me , shouting , with his face very close to me it was very frightening he was jealous , resentful , maddened for anyone else , he was charming , amusing and very popular",3.0
"nicky wasn t in the care home for long and was reunited with her mother before being sent to boarding school nicky loved her new school uniform and tie but was subjected to a subtler form of mental abuse after her mother left robert for derek jackson , a brilliant , wealthy physicist who split from pamela mitford to marry janetta in 1951 derek drove eight year old nicky to her new school in his flash car he had this great buick and i was embarrassed he sensed my embarrassment and drove round and round on the gravel in front of the school he loved it",3.0
"derek called her knickers oh , god , he was ghastly i never liked him he was quite happy to pay for me to go to school , he wanted to please my mother , but he didn t care a fiddle about me he would test nicky on maths and delight in her failures she often confuses her numbers , even now",3.0
"derek had a daughter with janetta when my sister was born , derek went off with my mother s sister my mother was devastated and miserable it was all very frightening the big question of my childhood was to help her be happy it was the wrong way round , but that s how it was",3.0
"all the while , nicky secretly idolised her biological father , kenneth sinclair loutit he was a doctor who had treated casualties in the spanish civil war and enjoyed an illustrious career with the world health organisation \( his life is an inspiration to all of us , said a newsletter for former who staff after his death \) janetta never married kenneth but nicky bore his surname , looked a bit like him and thought he must be wonderful she only met him a couple of times but her fantasy was sustained when he posted her a really exciting american indian leather jacket i was thrilled with that present but it would be months , years between contact",3.0
"when she was nine , the one reliable man in her childhood helped to reunite father and daughter james macgibbon was a publisher and friend of nicky s father kenneth nicky played with james s son , robert , and adored them both james , robert and her father planned to sail across the channel and on to paris together and james , thoughtfully , suggested they invite nicky along",3.0
"in her book , nicky s paintings recall her excitement about the trip , the boat setting sail and then the horror her father forcing himself on her in a cramped cabin he sexually abused her on their week long journey across the channel and up the seine to paris she couldn t tell anyone he specifically said it was something special between us",3.0
the macgibbons slept in a separate cabin and didn t know they were appalled when nicky told them 30 years later,3.0
"boarding school was a release i felt saved by boarding school i loved it but had to slightly pretend that i didn t , because my mother and her bohemian friends were scornful of school , she says she was beaten by a maths teacher and then found friendship with one particular teacher he was wonderful , very inspiring , she says he loved me and i was very important to him he took her on little excursions in his car and read under milk wood and the bible he continued lessons in his bedroom , where several pupils joined him in bed as his favourite , nicky had to put her head on his chest looking back , it was sexual , but it wasn t overtly sexual like my father s abuse , says nicky",3.0
"one day , she was swimming with other pupils , naked , in the lily pond in the school grounds \( which , bizarrely , they were allowed to do \) she had reached puberty and her friends were envious of her breasts , but he saw that she had got too big and i wasn t this sweet little girl snuggled up to him he ended their special relationship it was devastating his rejection was like everything in my childhood it wasn t said , so i couldn t reply , please don t it just happened suddenly , i was never invited into his room again she recalls his next favourite a younger , skinnier pupil it was terrible , she says",3.0
"everyone s life is like that isn t it \? says nicky at one point this isn t brute horror , it s just normal life doesn t she feel angry about her abuse \? oh anger , she ponders a lot of the abuse wasn t violent i ve had a very privileged life but she is angry with her father i can rage at the image of him in his grave i can t really speak to my father s other children , who don t really believe my father did anything , so there s anger there",3.0
"when she was 15 , she met him again , in paris he took me out to dinner and wanted the fantasy that we were lovers i was terribly confused he didn t lie on top of me and do terrible things like he did when i was younger , but i was certainly in an abusive relationship a decade and a half later , she confronted him about the abuse he cried and said , yes , i was a terrible bastard and he was so sorry i even managed to feel sorry for him , but he tried to continue his sick relationship with me he was never really sorry and he never really changed",3.0
"nicky s adulthood has been shaped by this abuse most disastrously , when she was a young mother , with three young boys , she and her ex husband joined an ashram in india led by a charismatic , free loving , abusive guru nicky was beaten up in group therapy yet remained in the ashram for four years nicky knew she must escape and eventually returned to britain , where she raised her three boys was it being a painter \? she wonders somehow i knew there was beauty in life too and i had to get out",3.0
"nicky can now talk about her three abusive fathers but is less comfortable discussing her mother her own mother died while she was pregnant with me and she hated her father she was a lost , beautiful young thing in the war she talks about me in rosy , romantic terms , what a wonderful , independent child i was independent is the biggest praise she can give anyone that was just how posh parenting was in those days children were seen and not heard",3.0
"in contrast , nicky s three grown up sons are absolutely central in her life they are all terrific , which is amazing because i ve not been a terrific mother , she says the only thing i ve done is consistently loved them despite her traumatic childhood , her life , she says , has been full of beauty painting isn t an escape , but through creating i ve realised the depth of existence even if i m agonised , there s another side full of joy and light i ve had such a rich life and i m grateful i suppose i was enabled to explore , even when things were very painful",3.0
"she does not see herself as a victim funnily enough , being a victim is one of my mother s positions , she says my mother was quite clear , all men are bastards , but because of the abuse , if men wanted me that was wonderful when she met her current husband , the author jonathan gathorne hardy , she was startled that he could be so kind , she says the major thing he s done is allow me to be myself and we ve really , really loved each other ever since , so that s all right",3.0
"i wonder at her achievement of enjoying loving relationships when her childhood was cursed by terrible men how the hell have i done it \? she laughs she points out that as well as her two marriages she s had great support from james macgibbon , his wife and their son , robert , who is still a close friend i did feel loved , she says there s always been someone in my life who has sort of loved me",3.0

"having moved into a rather pokey and clinical flat , i couldn t compete with the family home and , rightly or wrongly , felt i needed reasons for the children to want to be with me everything was smaller and darker where i lived , so what better way to make them think time spent with dad was fun than by enjoying life under the stars \?",3.0

"i would drive dave at a heady 57mph not that he couldn t go faster , it was just that i didn t see the point dave was born in the slower , pre internet era when having five gears was showing off if dave wanted to take his time , i may have been in the driving seat , but he was the cool dude calling the shots",3.0
"few drivers took exception to my slowness and occasionally i was known to put my foot down when heading back from cornwall , my son and i were flagged down by an unmarked police car i gave my son a cheery thumbs up thinking dave had actually managed to sneak past the speed limit instead , we were given a lecture as the back wheel of my bike was inhibiting a full view of the brake light",3.0
"back home , when my daughter was revising for exams , she d sit in the van i d pop out every hour or so and there she was , on the main road , with her books spread over the van s table dave had become her library and can take full credit for preparing a maths teacher of the future",3.0
"the van was a symbol of what fatherhood represented to me he was dependable , fun and always there he looked slightly bulky and just chugged along at his own speed \( although , like any dad , he d still got enough in the tank to attract attention with his own special dance \) and of course , he gave the illusion of being so damn cool",3.0

"television chef michel roux jr has emerged this week as an unlikely champion of the common man he is worried that restaurant goers do not understand the difference between a tip and a service charge , and hopes that others in the catering industry will join me in making it clearer for the public to understand what they are paying for",3.0
"he said this after admitting that his restaurant , the michelin starred le gavroche , keeps all the service charge added to its customers bills , instead of distributing the cash to staff",3.0
allow me to help a tip is cash given to your waiter in a private transaction denoting personal gratitude and also shared knowledge that the restaurant trade generally pays front of house staff as little as it can get away with a service charge is a ruse restaurants have developed in order to gain control over the tips their underpaid staff might otherwise receive which i think is pretty clear,3.0
"how could it be otherwise \? adding a service charge in a restaurant is like adding a body covering charge in a clothes shop the whole point of going to a restaurant is to sit at a table while people prepare and bring food and drink to you or , to put it more simply , to receive services and pay for them a service charge is a charge on your charge for services the public is confused , as roux knows perfectly well , because restaurants want us to be",3.0
"the trouble is that people are not as confused about roux s restaurant as they were a couple of weeks ago first , it was revealed that staff in the extremely posh restaurant were being paid 5 50 an hour for a 68 hour week roux said he was sorry presumably he meant for flagrantly breaking the law in this manner while assuming that the victims of this violation would protect him because they wanted the work",3.0
"but he couldn t leave it there when the thoughts of his critics turned to questions about what happened to service charges and tips , roux , or a spokeswoman anyway , decided once again to have a go at outfoxing people wages are not dependent on fluctuating levels of discretionary service charges or cash tips",3.0
"that sentence has a terrible beauty about it the spokeswoman is trying to make out that it would be terribly unfair to let staff rely on the vagaries of customer discretion and that they re doing the staff a favour by treating service charges as revenue , so that no criminally underpaid staff member is left behind they pay tax on the service charges , they explain so if their staff need in work benefits , they re doing their bit there too lovely",3.0
"so , basically , roux has come over all educate the public because he got caught out in deceiving the public i say the public , though of course hardly anyone can afford to eat at le gavroche , which is now raising its menu prices because it s removing its service charge which only goes to show what a moveable feast , if i may say , the service charge was in the first place",3.0
"the depressing thing is that this issue has been around for years if the public isn t by now fully educated about the less than transparent nature of service charges and the variations in how they are distributed , then we re never going to be the government is currently considering making it illegal for businesses to take any cut of service charges at all this is a good idea , but as we have seen from the wages paid at le gavroche , the most putatively respectable and financially secure of businesses are not at all averse to breaking the law",3.0
"yet more depressing is the fact that the public for whom roux cares so greatly is so enthusiastically complicit in helping the world of business and finance towards its goal of a cashless economy in which money can become entirely abstract even as it controls and tracks our every move we don t want to fart around with splitting bills on cards then digging around for cash to provide a tip as well , because we re all convenience junkies it makes it easy for businesses to hoover up everything",3.0
"and you can never tell the good guys from the bad guys plenty of restaurants are pretty scrupulous about ensuring tips are divided equally among employees they re the ones in which the staff are familiar figures , because they stay for years in their jobs and that really is the second best way the charming young people who know how to flirt will get plenty of tips , the acne scarred washer upper will get none so pooling and dividing the tips evens out the darwinism",3.0
"the best way , of course , is to set your wages so that neither the giver nor the receiver feels used or exploited , mutual respect is maintained and no one relies on tips at all but , somehow , that kind of thinking seems to be something akin to totalitarian marxism",3.0
"meanwhile , back in the gentle world of the free market , the only thing to try to keep doing is naming and shaming , picking off bad employers one by one so that others think they might be next it may not be the village green stocks but it s still pretty medieval no wonder restaurants weren t a thing back then",3.0

"the london gin maker sipsmith has been swallowed up by beam suntory , the world s third largest spirits company , as it tries to tap into surging demand for handcrafted tipples",3.0
"the japanese owner of jim beam , maker s mark , teacher s and courvoisier is thought to have paid as much as 50m to buy out sipsmith s shareholders , including sam galsworthy and fairfax hall , who founded the brand with jared brown just eight years ago",3.0
"all three will be staying on to run the business , which has 35 staff and will continue to be run out of its traditional copper pot distillery in chiswick , west london",3.0
"galsworthy said sipsmith already sold 30 of its gin overseas and demand was growing like billyo in the us , australia and northern europe as well as japan he said teaming up with beam suntory would help the company achieve its aim of building a lasting brand",3.0
"we have worked tirelessly to share our gin of the highest quality with discerning sippers , said galsworthy in this new chapter , we have found the perfect partners to take sipsmith to all four corners of the globe",3.0
sipsmith is one of hundreds of artisanal distillers set up in recent years amid a growing trend towards smaller brands with an authentic backstory it claims to have pioneered a gin renaissance in london by starting up the city s first copper distillery for nearly 200 years,3.0
"sipsmith s sales have risen by between 60 and 70 a year for the past two years as brits have been quaffing gin in record amounts this year 40m bottles were bought as a 19 rise in sales outstripped growth in sparkling wine , according to the wine and spirit trade association \( wsta \)",3.0
"that is part of an international trend that has led to gin exports rising at record levels sales to the us alone have soared 553 in the past decade , reaching 159m in 2015",3.0
"jonny forsyth , global drinks analyst at the market analysts mintel , said it was no surprise that beam suntory had bought sipsmith as the major spirits producers recognised they faced a challenge from fast growing craft brands",3.0
"millennial consumers , in particular , really value small batch heritage spirit brands rather than big brands with a more mainstream audience it is a lot like the craft beer where we ve seen big brands say it s time we bought these brands before they become big competition",3.0
"he said the buyout of the craft gin distiller monkey 47 by pernod ricard in january marked the beginning of a trend that was likely to escalate , although there were few craft gin makers who have reached any serious scale",3.0
"forsyth said major spirit companies were moving to buy out producers at a relatively early stage in their development , after letting craft beer startups gain market share before they began buying them up",3.0
but he added it s a risky thing to do as the younger consumer really demands authenticity from a brand sipsmith is still playing on its craft and smaller size and there s a real disconnect with being part of one of the major spirits companies in the world,3.0
"galsworthy said he was confident that beam suntory would give the brand real independence and it would continue to produce its gin in exactly the same manner he said he was committed for life to sipsmith and while the current staff and founding shareholders , who include family and friends , would no longer hold shares in the company they had agreed long term financial incentives so they could share in its future success",3.0
"matt shattock , chairman and chief executive of beam suntory , said we really admire what sipsmith has accomplished , and we re very excited to team up with them to maximise the global potential of sipsmith",3.0

gin was popularised in the uk via british troops who were given the spirit as dutch courage during the 30 years war but the industry really boomed in the early 1700s after king william iii loosened regulation,3.0
gin became so widely consumed that the amount sold daily began to exceed that of beer it was a cheap drink drunk by the poor,3.0
"attempts to control the market in the 1730s led to riots and failed to put a lid on growing sales in 1750 the gin act finally restricted distribution by licensing spirit retailers hogarth s famous print gin lane , produced in 1751 , showed the dangers of addiction to the spirit",3.0
"gin s image first began to change in the 1850s when distillers opened gin palaces , luxurious drinking establishments designed to entice more well off patrons the gin and tonic was also born as brits in colonial india mixed the spirit with sugar and lime to make taking quinine for malaria more palatable gin reached the peak of sophistication when mixed with vermouth to create the martini cocktail , chosen by ian fleming as the drink of choice with vodka and shaken , not stirred for james bond",3.0

"a group of british modelling agencies that represent names including yasmin le bon , sophie dahl and stella tennant have been fined 1 5m for colluding to fix prices charged to retailers , fashion brands and other customers",0.0
"the uk competition regulator has fined fm models , models 1 , premier , storm and viva , along with industry trade body the association of model agents \( ama \) , for price fixing modelling services for at least two years from march 2013",3.0
"the competition and markets authority \( cma \) found that the agencies and their association systematically exchanged information and discussed prices , in some cases agreeing to fix minimum prices or agree a common approach to pricing",3.0
"the price collusion affected customers including high street chains , online fashion retailers and consumer goods brands that use models to front their products and appear in ad campaigns",3.0
"the regulator s investigation looked into pricing practices across a broad spectrum of modelling assignments , from fashion magazine shoots offering models fees of a few hundred pounds to ad campaigns offering more than 10 , 000",3.0
the cma said that the collusion and price fixing did not extend to the services of so called top models,3.0
"the fine and ruling is hugely damaging to the reputation of the modelling agencies and their industry premier represented naomi campbell for 17 years , while storm discovered kate moss and cara delevingne , although all three are now with other agencies models 1 represents sophie dahl and yasmin le bon , while viva s models include stella tennant and natalia vodianova",3.0
"the two biggest fines were charged to storm \( 491 , 000 \) and models one \( 394 , 000 \) fm models , which has been given a 251 , 00 fine , shut down earlier this year",3.0
"models 1 , premier and storm said in a joint statement that they intended to appeal against the ruling the cma s findings are wholly mistaken , the agencies said",3.0
"the agencies said the cma has failed to understand the role of the modelling agency , which is in part to protect the interests of models they said their actions were not designed to force up or fix prices but to protect the interests of models and also ensure a sustainable market which benefits customers , the economy and society",3.0
"we reached our decision to appeal the cma s findings without hesitation , said john horner , the managing director of models 1 the cma is penalising modelling agencies for seeking to maintain professional standards within the industry whilst also protecting the interests of young and vulnerable people",3.0
le bon credited the ama with nurturing and protecting her at the beginning of her career and said it taught me how to become the model i am today,3.0
"had it not been for the knowledge , experience and professionalism of the agency i would not have sustained a career in the industry , she said it takes time and commitment to build a career and the ama , with its agents , have always sought to protect young models from exploitation , but also from clients who are under pressure to pay increasingly low fees",3.0
storm model hannah cassidy said the ama s guidance had been essential because the pressure and dangers of exploitation are real,3.0
"i have benefited from their experience in negotiating rates , working conditions , terms and image use , she said agents promote but also protect models from unfair contract and exclusivity terms which could harm their careers they also make sure i get paid on time",3.0
"viva , which was fined 245 , 000 , also strenuously denies wrongdoing",3.0
"viva strongly denies it agreed to fix minimum prices or that it agreed a common approach to pricing , said a spokeswoman for the agency to date , the cma has produced no evidence to demonstrate that the conduct which is the subject of the cma s decision had any effect on the rates models represented by viva received for assignments this is because it did not have any such effect",3.0
"the cma said that the ama and the agencies also sought to influence other members of the industry body by regularly issuing email circulars , known as ama alerts , urging them to resist the prices offered by customers on the grounds they were too low",3.0
"when businesses collude rather than compete the ultimate losers are customers , said john wotton , the chair of the case decision group at the cma , which made the decision this type of behaviour harms the economy and deprives businesses and consumers of the benefits of competition",3.0
