Bangladeshi garment workers are neither mysterious nor in need of saving. Journalists and consumer organisations should call up the NGWF offices in Dhaka and get the organisation's opinion on the Bangladeshi garment industry. On Tuesday no one other than I had contacted the NGWF about the Primark labels. Their opinion is that poor pay and conditions are not unique to one brand (Primark) but rather "applicable to almost all the brands that are sourcing from Bangladesh."

The NGWF is also clear that it does not want to see the destruction of the industry through consumer boycotts as there are no other job opportunities for the four million women working in those factories.

They do however want people to work with them to pressure corporations into raising pay and conditions. "People in the UK should ask brands like Primark, Marks & Spencer, Edinburgh Woollen Mill, or New Look – about the reality of their supply chain," says Amin. "They should pressure brands to disclose their suppliers and to sign the Bangladesh accord, and to ensure a fair price of Bangladeshi garments and pay a living wage to garment workers."

Pressure groups like War on Want and Labour Behind the Label are helping workers. But other consumer groups should also contact NGWF to discuss how they could help.

In the 1990's, to guard against patronising or victimising garment workers, the United Students Against Sweatshops (USAS) adopted as its motto a few lines taken from Lilla Watson of the Aboriginal Activists Group in Queensland, Australia in the 1970's: "If you have come to help me you are wasting your time. But if you've come because your liberation is bound up with mine, then let us work together."

Progressive change in Bangladesh depends on millions of young women taking on some of the world's most repressive institutions and corporations. They are already engaged in this fight and we can work with them. What we must not do is silence their agency and their role in history by reducing them to a passive cry for help.

When Primark opens its first US store next year, it will be with the help of an army of its European fans. The cheap fashion chain doesn't have an online shop, and doesn't advertise. Instead, Primark will use its own shoppers to help sell the brand to fellow fashion lovers by posting photographs of themselves wearing their latest purchases on Primania, the company's new social media site. Less than a year old, Primania now gets 300,000 visitors a week. Shoppers' comments, often complete with the price tag, are translated into six languages to reflect the group's spread across Europe.

Like several other high-street names, the brand is blurring the lines between publishing, shopping and social media in a bid to get closer to its customers.

Primania is a simpler version of online fashion retailer Asos's Fashion Finder, which runs magazine-style features – a recent one was "What to wear for your graduation" – and has 160,000 registered users. Both supply a constant stream of street-fashion trends, styling ideas and fun photos to their own editorial teams, who then mix shoppers' ideas and selfies with fashion tips, new product information and other content.

Asos also publishes a glossy magazine with circulation of 470,000 – more than Glamour, Grazia or even the giveaway Stylist. A digital version, available in French and German, and in US and Australian editions, goes to another 100,000 shoppers. More than 30 staff at Asos's headquarters work on editorial content, and there are editors in each international territory the digital magazine hits.

John Bason, finance director of Primark's parent company, Associated British Foods, says: "Showing off your bargains is a characteristic of Primark shopping. Before social media was big it was all word of mouth – people saying, 'I like your outfit. Where did you get it?' That helped Primark grow. With social media, word of mouth is increasingly powerful."

Primania, he says, took inspiration from other social media sites, like the Primark Haul videos of Youtube blogger Zoella, which can attract more than a million viewers. "Primania is owned by Primark consumers and it's crucial that it's customer-led. Part of the pull of the brand is that it is something 'owned by me'," says BasonAlice Spencer of consultantcy Brand Union says shopping is no longer just about buying, but lifestyle: "Post-recession consumers want to hear (from) brands. They want to know what they think, where they stand and what their beliefs are. In a digital world, people no longer go into a shop, see something and decide to buy it. It is much more about buying into a lifestyle."

With more than half of female consumers now starting each fashion shopping trip via a smartphone or tablet computer, eye-catching content generates sales. That content might be exclusive footage of favoured bands, celebrity interviews, "how-to" guides or fashion tips. The aim is to become the shoppers' friend, interested in everything they love, whether it's in stock or not.

Asos editorial director Melissa Dick, who used to be online editor of women's magazine Elle, says she left traditional mags because she realised they weren't keeping up with the way young women consumed information on lifestyle and fashion.

For young women, she says, magazines "aren't democratic or collaborative enough. There has to be more dialogue. You can't just broadcast as message; women want to check out how their peers are dressing or behaving, and find their views and reviews of an item."

Asos, she says, is even experimenting with using shoppers' pictures instead of model shots to illustrate some products in the transactional part of the site.

Shoppers also wanted to be able to buy what they saw with a couple of clicks, share their opinions and generally be part of the action. They wanted original information, ideas or pictures that could be shared with their friends. "Young women are on social media every 30 seconds," says Dick. "We are giving them content they can share, and increase their social currency."

Upmarket online fashion store Net-A-Porter is also trying publishing to bring in sales with Porter, a bi-monthly glossy magazine which shoppers can scan using a smartphone app to link to the shopping site. Not everything in the magazine is available on the Net-A-Porter website, but the firm promises to help shoppers find a way to buy most items, with links to brands' own websites or a concierge service.

Magazines and newspapers are trying to fight back, however. Grazia has launched an iPad app which readers can use to buy featured products, and Vogue owner Condé Nast has also been experimenting with shoppable websites.

Some of the biggest high-street retailers – Marks & Spencer, Sainsbury's, Waitrose and John Lewis – are old hands in the magazine business, but even they are making efforts to reach out to customers. Waitrose now has a TV channel on its website, with cooking ideas, "how-to" videos, celebrity interviews and cookery demos by famous chefs. Online recipes from TV shows can be quickly converted into a shopping list of items that can be bought online.

Marks & Spencer has added a style and living section to its website, offering magazine-style content including editors' product picks, trend suggestions and celebrity interviews. It has hired new staff, including former Times and Financial Times fashion writer Nicola Copping, and the 20-strong team includes specialist editors for categories such as beauty and womenswear.

Some say the new-look M&S website is more a hindrance that a help to its shoppers – mainly older women, who might be more focused on making purchases than the twentysomethings of Asos or Primark. Sales growth through the website has not been good, although marketing director Patrick Bousquet Chavanne says style and living is the fastest-growing section of the website and accounts for close to half its traffic. He says shoppers are 24% more likely to make a purchase if they've read about it.

Dick reckons all retailers will have to adapt to the new world of digital sharing: "For a shop to become a brand, it has to have a relationship with its customers – and the best way to do that is through other customers."
We were always so busy and excited by all the difficult things that they just happened and we overcame them one by one. In retrospect, one of the hardest things is to make sure you get your pricing right, including your time – which, as it happens, is all completely taken up if you do your own business. Making sure you love what you do is imperative.

Rosie and I are like two sides of one coin. We met at college, we worked together, we did everything together. We dressed the same, liked the same music and both loved making things. Now we have grown into ourselves and had to focus on our strengths to get the most out of our time.

I can't believe Tatty Devine turns 15 this September – the years have flown by and there have been so many amazing times. Last year, out of the blue, Rosie and I were awarded MBEs. What with all the outfit-choosing and planning where to have lunch afterwards it was a bit like we got married. My parents nearly burst. They have always let me do my own thing and have always helped and supported me so it meant a lot to see them beaming.

Now, I often wake up in the middle of the night with an idea for something but when we started Tatty Devine it was not a classic lightbulb moment.

Rosie and I started to make things together for fun. It was all about fun. We sparked off each other and we could make things happen. The beginning was a rollercoaster ride from market stalls to London Fashion Week, from making things from finds in the street to our designs being shot for the millennium issue of Vogue. The whole thing was more like diving in at the deep end.

We had no set plan to go into the fashion world. We both studied fine art at Chelsea so making jewellery felt a bit like a continuation of the practice we had started there. I used to sneakily read Vogue for fun when I was meant to be reading Kant After Duchamp and the like. We didn't have a plan, we thought we might do jewellery for a year, then make zines, then be in a band, and then whatever else we could dream up. We had so much momentum at the start we just crashed into the fashion world head first.

Tatty Devine is laser cut acrylic. When we first started we made things from found objects, but as we grew we ran out of cake decorations and dart flights so were on the lookout for something that we could control ourselves. The really exciting moment happened when we went on a trip to New York and discovered a whole street of sign makers. They were selling little acrylic shapes for bars and shops to create signs with but we knew straight away this had got to be jewellery. Back in London we found a model maker who had a laser cutter who could do it for us.

Fifteen years later and acrylic is still exciting as I have built up such an extensive knowledge on how I can control it and push it into whatever I want it to be. It allows us the freedom to create crazy one-offs and we can keep all our production in Britain.

My mobile phone keeps me awake. I don't have it by my bed any more or I just check my emails and Facebook too much.

I can't sleep in, I have never been good at lie-ins. If I wake up at 4am chances are I will plan entire lines of new jewellery or play out the whole day ahead in my mind, then fall asleep again at five to seven and not want to wake up.

Something inside just craves making things, new things that don't exist yet. I fire off Rosie and we get excited and I go off like a rocket with more ideas for fun things.

I have been so lucky to work with some amazing people over the past 15 years but my dear friend Rob Ryan is a constant source of inspiration to me, in both his work and the way he runs his business. We recently collaborated on a fine jewellery collection in gold and silver, which will always have a special place in my heart.

As creative director I wish I spent more of my time creating new jewellery, but being part of a team running Tatty Devine keeps me pretty busy. I design around 300 pieces a year and some weeks I do nothing but invent new things, but then other weeks I meet with new possible collaborators, create photo shoots, have meetings with stores, design pop-up shops. That is what is so exciting, I never know what will happen next.

It seems so unlikely as to be incredible: a cry for help sewn into a Primark dress. First one, now two Swansea shoppers have come forward and told the South Wales Evening Post that they found extra labels sewn into items bought last year. "Forced to work exhausting hours" read the first; "Degrading sweatshop conditions" says the latest, pictured in the 25 June edition of the paper.

Primark has promised to investigate, and may hope the labels will turn out to be a hoax. Perhaps they are a new form of direct action, carried out with a needle in the changing rooms – or even by a mole on the inside?

But two months after the anniversary of the Rana Plaza factory collapse in Bangladesh, when most of those injured and bereaved by the disaster are still waiting for compensation – though Primark, unlike other retailers who have admitted to a presence in the factory, has contributed to the compensation fund – the secret message hidden inside a piece of women's clothing is a startling image. Could a garment worker somewhere in the developing world really reach across the heads of managers, unions, manufacturers, governments, western multinationals and shopfloors into the wardrobe of an ordinary shopper, to make a complaint? And if so, what do they want us to do about it?

Improve their working conditions, is the obvious answer. But how? One anonymous senior executive from a big high street retailer recently told the Guardian that shoppers "don't care" about conditions, and research shows most "prefer inexpensive over respect for human rights". If consumers were more bothered about workers, goes this argument, the industry would progress.

Campaigners, including the designer Katharine Hamnett, call this a cop-out. Differences between retailers are proof that they, too, drive change. European brands have gone further than those in the US in their support for Bangladeshi trade unions in the aftermath of the Rana Plaza catastrophe, though Matalan and Benetton have yet to make any contribution to the compensation fund despite admitting links with the factory.

But it is true that the rise of ethical shopping, or what US sociologist Juliet Schor calls "conscious consumption", has made limited headway in fashion. It is possible to choose free-range over factory-produced eggs even in convenience stores; much harder to opt to pay a premium of a couple of pounds for a T-shirt that comes with ethical plus points.

In part this is down to the sheer complexity of the fashion supply chain. Perhaps the most poignant and ironic thing about the message in a Primark dress, is that as far away as the machine operators in the stitch-and-sew factories of Bangladesh and elsewhere might appear, they are far closer to us than most of the other millions of people involved in making our clothes.

Thanks in part to the publicity surrounding the Rana Plaza disaster, we can at least imagine the men and women who sew them. But before a cotton dress is cut and stitched it is dyed and printed; before that it is woven from yarn into cloth; before that it is spun from raw cotton into yarn. And before that it is planted, picked, and ginned (or cleaned). Cotton is an agricultural commodity and the world's most important non-food crop, grown on all five continents and by some of the poorest people in the world.

Long before we got to meet Dorset fishermen at the farmer's market, stories about where food comes from was part of the story advertisers told us. Think of the man from Del Monte, or the cows on Ben & Jerry's ice-cream. People like to see the name of the farmer who grew their carrots on the supermarket packaging, and picture pigs in fields rather than crates.

Fashion simply can't deliver this kick, or not without tremendous efforts on the parts of specialists such as Bruno Pieters, whose recently launched Honest By label provides details of exactly where and how each item was made. The story of textile production is the story of industrialisation, of thrilling technological innovation in the north of England. But it is also the story of slavery and the destruction of textile manufacturing in India, as Ian Jack wrote last week. It's no wonder this cry of rage from a garment factory, whoever put it there, pricks our consciences. Even if we can hardly begin to understand why.
Fashion retailer Jane Norman is to disappear from the high street after its owner put it into administration.

The UK brand has had financial problems in the past with its current owner, Edinburgh Woollen Mill, buying a pared down version of the chain out of administration in 2011.

In a statement confirming the appointment of a restructuring firm Grant Thornton, the company said it was "no longer able to continue to support its loss-making UK and Ireland retail stores". It said the 24-store chain had been placed in administration in a move that puts 157 jobs at risk.

"Like many retailers, we have seen extremely challenging conditions on the high street for several years in what is a very competitive sector in young fashion," said the company. "While we have made every effort for a number of years to makes those stores work, that part of the business is no longer viable."

Jane Norman employs 57 full time staff and about 100 part-time. "We intend to continue trading the stores for as long as possible with a view to achieving the best outcome for all concerned, in particular those people based in the stores," said Grant Thornton partner Les Ross. "It is likely, however, that store closures are inevitable."

The brand will not be axed altogether. Edinburgh Woollen Mill, which also owns Peacocks, intends to sell its clothing online and in department stores overseas. "We fundamentally believe in the Jane Norman brand and its future as a web and international concessions business," it said. "For that reason we have taken the difficult decision to restructure the business to focus on future opportunities."
With a cream leather lounger strategically placed under a map of the world labelled "the world is ours", the Manchester office of Boohoo founder Mahmud Kamani has the menace of a Bond villain's lair.

Kamani and his business partner Carol Kane are indeed plotting world domination but their weapon of choice is fashion website boohoo.com. With its £8 maxi dresses and £12 jeans the retailer is giving Primark a run for its money as its targets fashion-hungry 16- to 24-year-olds with limited finances.

"The map doesn't need dots," explains Kamani. "We're going to get everywhere." For many years Boohoo had been quietly going about its business in a rundown former mill. But the Kamani family sacrificed anonymity in March when they pressed the button on a stock market listing that earned them a fortune – and a large amount of scrutiny from potential investors.

The retailer has an impressive track record, having gone from a standing start in 2007 to profits of nearly £11m from sales of £110m in the year to the end of February. It has just completed the first of several phases of expansion planned for its Burnley warehouses, which will eventually be able to handle sales of £1bn. So far so Asos, the fast-growing fashion website, which until recently was a stock market darling.

After running a private business for decades, becoming a stock market pawn can be a shock for entrepreneurs used to doing what they think is best. Kamani is a refreshingly straight talker and reportedly told analysts at a recent meeting that Boohoo's mobile website was "shit". He is coy when asked about it and his PR offers that "it is being upgraded".

The listing has been a baptism of fire for the senior team, including Kamani's brother Jalal, who is trading director. After debuting at 50p the shares soared to 85p but are now back just below the offer price.

The company's office has the air of a start-up, with crowded banks of desks in every room, shabby paintwork and trendy twentysomethings running around looking busy. In the foyer a man is sorting hangers into giant cardboard boxes. With more than 500 staff the company has outgrown the warren and has just bought another building around the corner.

The IPO reaped £240m for the family and board members, but the pair have not been on a shopping spree. Kamani has a Rolls-Royce Phantom parked outside and Kane drives a shiny tank-like Land Rover, but they are not new. And although Kane is doing up an old house in Staffordshire she jokes it "would be nice to have a bathroom".

Indeed Kamani labours the point that Boohoo is not an overnight success but the culmination of decades of graft. "This is not an eight-year story; this is a family business that's been going for 30 years."

A key figure is Mahmud's elderly father Abdullah, who escaped war-torn Kenya in the 60s to start a new life in the north-west with his wife and four children. Abdullah's first venture was selling handbags on a market stall, but he went on to found what would become a successful family textile business, supplying high street names such as New Look and Primark, before he focused on Boohoo.

"It was a case of rags to riches for my dad," explains Kamani. "He bought his first Rolls-Royce 30 years ago and let my eldest brother Jalal drive it out of the garage. He adds: "My father is 80 and comes into work every day."

Kamani appears to have inherited his father's work ethic and is either on the phone or looking at messages on one of his two handsets when the conversation lulls. He is momentarily distracted by an email and elbows Kane. It turns out that the latest sales figures have come through and he is surprised how good they are. She quickly explains that a promotion has just kicked in.

"People have invested in us and that's an honour," he continues. "We work hard. We worked hard when we were on the market stalls; we work hard now. It's what we've always done. I don't have another hobby or life. I want to walk into my office an old man."

After proving useful in the runup to the flotation, the comparison with Asos stopped being favourable earlier this month, when Asos blamed the strong pound and heavy discounting for a massive profit warning. The alert spooked investors, wiping as much as 40% off Asos's share price on the day and pulling Boohoo down with it.

It has led to a dramatic reappraisal of Asos's prospects, with Morgan Stanley analyst Anisha Singhai slashing her price for the stock from £40 to £25. (Asos suffered a further setback this weekend when a fire at its Barnsley warehouse forced it to stop taking orders.) On the surface the fashion websites have a lot in common, but there are key differences. While Asos carries 75,000 products, including 1,000 third-party brands, Boohoo stocks just 9,000 of its own clothing lines.

Kane, who is co-chief executive of the listed group, says the focus on own-brand is key. "We're in full control of our pricing structure all the way through," she says. "If you want to promote your own brand you haven't got any restrictions."

After working together for more than 20 years – Kane set up its design team in 1993 – the co-chief executives are prone to interrupting each other. "Any business doing international trade will have challenges on foreign exchange," continues Kamani. "But we only sell Boohoo, so we command the price."

Unusually Boohoo buys very small quantities of stock, 300-500 pieces at a time, with one in four orders then repeated. "Because this is an e-commerce business you've got to be fresh all the time," says Kane. "A traditional retailer might buy three or four styles but we'll buy 25. That way we've covered off the overall volume required and the one that really works we'll get back into."

At the moment Boohoo has seven major markets, including the UK, US and France, although it ships to more than 100. Despite the breakneck growth of recent years the cream lounger still looks pristine. Kamani says he never uses it for brainstorming sessions. "Once I was really tired and actually laid on it and tried to rest," he says. "But every fucker kept walking through the door because I always say my door's open."
The textile and clothing industry is the second largest employer after agriculture in the developing world, and a large percentage of this workforce are women. Research shows that empowering and investing in women has a cumulative bonus: women are likely to spend their income on their children and families, on education, health and nutrition, bringing long term positive change and prosperity to communities.

There are numerous fashion brands making a strong social impact but restricted to their local markets. Because I am aware of the role that fashion plays in our lives and the lives of those that create it, I decided to support these brands and bring them to a global mainstream market via the online boutique Fashion ComPassion.

As of April, more than 53,000 Palestine refugees from Syria were seeking safety and shelter from the continuing conflict in Lebanon. One of the first brands Fashion ComPassion partnered was Palestyle, a brand providing jobs and an income to Palestinian refugee women in camps in Lebanon and Jordan.

With a vision of becoming a leading accessory brand in the Middle East, Fashion ComPassion worked as its retailer, agent and distributor, helping to build its market in Pakistan and securing its stock in the British Museum. Palestyle started with a small team of 20 women who used their skills and craftsmanship to add traditional embroidery and designs to fashion pieces, and today works with 100 women, investing in community projects such as the Water Tank Exchange Program, which has provided clean water to over 4,000 refugees.

Rags2Riches is another brand creating positive change through fashion, working with women in Payatas, one of the poorest parts of the Philippine capital. According to the Payatas Poverty Alleviation Foundation, almost 40% of the active population are unemployed and nearly half are earning less than 4,000 Philippine pesos ($100) a month.

Many women living in Payatas were part of the cottage industry of rug weavers controlled by middle men, leaving them with minimal money for the work they created. Rags2Riches was created to give these skilled women fair access to the market. It has formed a partnership with well known Filipino designers who have transformed the scrap material into high-end fashion accessories. In three years, the brand has supported more than 400 women (pdf) , upcycled more than 500 tons of scrap cloth, and increased the earning potential of artisans from less than $0.02 per day to more than $10 per day.

In Rwanda, Indego Africa is working with women to support them through economic empowerment and education. This summer it is launching a leadership academy in Kigali that will provide business training for 100 emerging artisan leaders over the next two years. Indego Africa has taken the work of its artisans to a global level by partnering with the likes of J. Crew, Eileen Fisher, TOMS and Nicole Miller.

Another social enterprise, Sougha, was established by the Khalifa Fund in the United Arab Emirates to preserve and promote the traditions of women emirati artisans. Sougha creates economic opportunities for isolated local communities by reviving their skills and connecting them to new markets. Due to religious and cultural restrictions, the women don't have access to the outside work, so the Sougha team visits these artisans, refines their products and sells them to a global market.

As an online retailer the social impact of Fashion ComPassion is not limited to just providing a platform for socially responsible brands. It also creates awareness around sustainability, and supports girls' education through its partnership with the United Nations World Food Program , which provides school meals and take-home rations as an incentive for poor families to send their daughters to school, while giving girls the nutrients they need to focus in class.

Ethical fashion companies do not have to compete with big retailers; they are different and can grow alongside them. Since the Rana Plaza factory collapse, steps have been taken by bigger brands to look into transparency, code of conduct, working conditions and wages. Retailers cannot afford another such disaster to happen, and checks are being introduced to ensure better standards. The bigger players will always dictate the fashion landscape but small retailers can also have a profound impact on the industry.

As consumers, we need to assess our needs, desires and the part we play in the cycle of consumption. Fashion has the power to bring positive change to the most disadvantaged women around the world, but it is only with the support of us all that the sustainable fashion industry can boom and grow.

The other day, I woke up to find several sexually explicit photos of myself in my inbox. Some of them showed me doing things I'd already written about in the widely quoted account of my encounter with photographer Terry Richardson at age 19. Others showed me doing things of which I had – and have – no memory at all. My body language is stiff, but a close reading of my face reveals nothing, even to me. The lights are on, but no one's home.

I have two different haircuts.

"Please let me know if it is indeed you, and if so, whether you think it's two occasions and you forgot, or what," New York Magazine reporter Benjamin Wallace wrote in the email.

This was not entirely unexpected. A little while before that, I came across a photo of Richardson reaching out to grab my breast. It jogged a vague memory of "Uncle Terry" groping me without asking – something I was always terrified would happen when I was modeling for Guys With Cameras – but which I didn't precisely recall happening in the shoot I wrote about. It made me wonder what else I wasn't remembering.

It was not a very good feeling to have, least of all when I'd already spoken at length about my experience in the belief that I was telling the absolute truth. I worried what conclusions Wallace would draw for his readers. My conclusions would, I figured, be somewhat different: trauma – particularly sexual trauma – affects memory, often in ways that allow predators to traumatize their victims while simultaneously rendering them unreliable witnesses to their own lives.

On Monday morning, instead of pictures, I woke up to Wallace's cover story, "Is Terry Richardson an Artist or a Predator?" Is that supposed to be a trick question?

From Roman Polanski to Woody Allen and thousands of "nice guys" in between, it should be obvious by now that artists and predators aren't mutually exclusive. Sexual predators aren't drooling monsters that hide in caves: they are husbands, fathers, employees, friends and, yes, sometimes artists. Why is this so hard for some people to understand?

But figuring the headline might have been written by an editor looking to titillate, I read on.

In more than 7,000 words, the false dichotomy of the headline is never directly addressed – despite all the words the article spends illuminating Richardson's glamorous-but-messed-up childhood, his nepotistic career arc and what various people think of his "provocative" work. Call me crazy, but allegations of sexual harassment and abuse are a little more important than what type of sandwich Uncle Terry likes to eat in the morning.

It treats the central question of Richardson's many critics – Was meaningful consent given for the sex acts in these images? – in a cursory fashion, given that it's the theme this major magazine article promises to explore. It isn't as though the author lacked for material: Wallace and I spoke for over an hour, and the only quote he used from me was in regard to the aforementioned images.

Stories from other people were treated similarly: brief points about their accusations accompanied by parenthetical denials from Richardson's camp. Charlotte Waters's story of assault was mentioned, but accompanied by the "mitigating" mention that she referred to herself as a pervert in an introductory email – almost as though that was a green light for whatever. Sena Cech released a statement about how her story was mischaracterized by Wallace.

As someone morbidly interested in the psychology of criminals and sociopaths – as well as the banal ways abuse weaves itself into our lives from generation to generation – I'll admit that I was able to dissociate myself enough to find the New York Magazine story an enthralling read in much the same way that I devoured the book Devil in the White City or the killer Eliot Rodger's lengthy manifesto. It offers detailed, socially-understandable explanations for Richardson's behavior: his unconventional and even traumatic childhood; his lack of empathy; his seemingly limited understanding of how coercion works; and all the people who enabled him to continue to operate.

There's even some mention of the power structures that keep Richardson insulated from the consequences of his actions, including the fact that agents send models to him and they feel, in the model Sarah Ziff's words, "pressured to comply because my agent had told me to make a good impression". (Ziff, in the years since, co-founded the labor organization Model Alliance to address the systemic problems that make young models vulnerable to both Richardsons and an economically exploitative system.)

Wallace does a good job describing the – if I'm being generous – willful naïveté that Richardson exhibits about his own "work". But his pose is undermined by the apparently savvy way he chooses "collaborators" for his more explicit work. "Kate Moss wasn't asked to grab a hard dick," said one anonymous photo agent – the first real nod to false sense of choice with which Richardson apparently presented his no-name models.

But, even the moments of clarity about the exploitative nature of the system in which Richardson has operated are surrounded by quotes from his "yes men" and women – one of whom is his girlfriend, although that's not mentioned – sounding as defensive and delusional as you'd expect.

After reading more about Uncle Terry's fucked-up childhood, I have to wonder: is the more important question How did he get this way?, or rather How do we stop him? Or is the real question even more complex:What does this say about the fashion industry as a whole that so many people have let him and other, sneakier people get away with this for so long? Would we really be having this conversation if Uncle Terry were just another abusive uncle and/or a member of the economic underclass? Or, conversely, if he were the CEO of a corporation using his position to get blowjobs from employees?

"Art" has apparently been deemed a falsely separate realm in which neither basic labor laws nor ethics apply, so it's not surprising that an exploration of how this man makes art (and uses sex) so badly misses the point about how that art (and the commoditization of it) enables him to get away with something far less than enthusiastic consent. Yes, Terry Richardson has muddied the waters by entwining his sex life – and his sexual predation – with his work life. But it's supposed to be up to journalists to disentangle those threads and shine a light on them, not just give a thumbs-up and move on.
First there were "nan shoes", "chunky sandals" and "pool sliders". But this summer's trend for ugly shoes has spawned a footwear movement all of its own, as the Birkenstock sandal steps up again. Despite being 50 years old, vegan-friendly and politically charged – American conservatives coined the pejorative term "Birkenstock liberals" in 2004 – the German orthopaedic sandal is proving to have more fashion staying power than Kate Moss.

The distinctive cork-soled sandals, first produced by Karl Birkenstock in 1964, are selling out across UK retailers. Amazon.co.uk's shoe store reports a 95% rise in sales of all varieties of the sandals in the last few weeks, while Asos has had similar success.

"The key style for us has been the Arizona [two-strap] in black and white, which is flying out," said Hayley Beech, worldwide buyer for Asos. "We have stocked Birkenstock for several years, but they have had an amazing season on Asos for spring/summer, with a huge sales increase on last year. We have had to do multiple trade repeats this season as the demand is so high."

The shoe is also popular at the luxury end of the market. "Birkenstock has done very well this summer. The blue-and-white stripe and navy colour sold out very quickly. We bought in the red, black and white solid colours, which came in a fortnight ago and have already sold out," said Natalie Kingham, buying director at luxury online retailer Matches Fashion. "Clients are looking for summer footwear options that are more grounding, that can be worn with a summer dress but which have a bit more attitude."

Birkenstock's two-strap Arizona is the style du jour, having made an appearance in the Céline spring/summer 2013 collection in Paris.

"That silhouette was universally considered ugly," Vogue contributor Katherine Bernard told the magazine in July 2013. "But [Céline designer] Phoebe Philo's luxe reinterpretation got me thinking. It's the most comfortable sandal in the world having a stylish renaissance."

Givenchy has also produced two versions of the Arizona sandal, one floral and one metallic, retailing at £545 and £595 respectively. The original Birkenstocks, at a rather more accessible £49.95, have enjoyed knock-on success as a result of their high-end brethren.

"Have they ever come back in fashion?" asked Robert Lusk, founder of the Natural Shoe Company, which owns the Birkenstock UK flagship store in central London. "To be honest, demand is so huge this year that we can't meet it. We've got workers pulling all kinds of shifts. They've pulled out all the stops to meet demand."

There are now 800 varieties of Birkenstocks, from triple strap to the thong, and more than 12m pairs were produced for the global market this year. The London flagship store recently underwent an overhaul, transforming the 600 square feet space to include iPads to enable customers to order online should their preferred model not be available in the shop.

Like all good family dynasties, the Birkenstock clan have had their hiccups. In 2004 a "sandal war" erupted when Susanne Birkenstock, separated from her husband, Christian, began producing high-heeled sandals, called the Beautystep, using her married name. "Beautystep is a nice name; I hope she sells a lot of product," Christian told the Guardian in 2005.

"The only problem is she has to leave the name Birkenstock off the shoes. People were telephoning our stores and saying, 'Oh, you've brought out a new range of sandals.' But we hadn't – she had. That's why we had to send letters to the shops explaining that they weren't Birkenstocks."

But the Birkenstock's longevity, usually underscored by a growth of 10-15% annually, is most notable for enjoying fashion revivals on roughly a 10-year cycle. In the 1990s the sandals became part of the Grunge aesthetic; Kate Moss wore a white pair of Arizona Birkenstocks in the now-infamous Corrine Day photoshoot for the Face magazine in 1990.

In the early 2000s, the style was reprised once again by a number of celebrities – a Guardian article from 2003 mentions Jude Law, Jade Jagger and Gwyneth Paltrow as wearers.

Lusk is philosophical about the Arizona design being replicated by other designers, not least because it has had a dramatic effect on sales of the original. "The two-strap Arizona silhouette is universally known, it's an iconic design. I was in Italy a few years ago buying a motorbike and I met this wonderful Italian family.

"The women asked what I did and I explained. Her husband asked her to translate and she just leant over and made the pattern of the two straps across her foot, and he understood straight away. That was a nice moment."

Not bad for a German orthopedic shoe that Lusk recalls was initially met with derision. "People laughed at them at first, they thought they were funny looking. But we've got the last laugh now, as they say."
Online fashion retailer Boohoo has shrugged off comparisons with Asos by posting with a bumper set of maiden results that showed profits had more than tripled.

"We are just innocent bystanders," said Boohoo co-founder Mahmud Kamani after last week's massive profit warning by Asos hit confidence in internet retailers with 9% wiped off the Boohoo share price on the day. "We don't compare ourselves with anybody. The share price moves with market sentiment."

The Manchester-based company has been on a rollercoaster ride since it joined London's junior market in March. After listing at 50p the shares soared to 85p, but have since fallen back.

Last Thursday more than a third was wiped of Asos's market value after it warned the strong pound and heavy discounting in markets such as Australia would hit profits this year. Both companies sell clothing, but Boohoo sells only its own-brand fashions and has a smaller selection, with just 9,000 styles to choose from. "Nothing has changed in the last 10 weeks," said Kamani.

The fashion retailer, which targets the 16-35 age group, was set up in 2006 by Kamani and his business partner Carol Kane. The co-chief executives previously supplied high street rivals such as Primark and New Look. Boohoo.com, which makes extensive use of social media, has been described as an online Primark.

"After all the trauma over the recent Asos profits warning, Boohoo seems to have shown it has a different business model," said independent retail analyst Nick Bubb. "Boohoo's own-label range gives it far more control than Asos apparently has over pricing and margins, and Boohoo has not needed to emulate Asos's discounting approach in Australia."

Boohoo said sales increased 63% to £110m in the year to 28 February, with pre-tax profits surging from just over £3m to nearly £11m. In the UK, its largest market, sales rose 60%. The new financial year had also started strongly with sales up 24% in the three months to 31 May. The firm has used the £50m raised at IPO to invest in its IT systems and warehouse, which has been expanded to support a turnover of £350m.

With profits coming in slightly ahead of expectations, the shares closed up nearly 10% at 50.5p.

"We view Boohoo as a brand and design-led online player with an under-rated competitive advantage in sourcing and supply chain," said Investec analyst Kate Calvert.
In the noughties, London fashion week was awash with Mulberry's distinctively shaped handbags. From the pouchy-pocketed Roxanne, wildly popular in 2004, to 2010's satchel-shaped Alexa, they were perennially tucked under the arms of fashion editors, buyers and celebrities.

Mulberry's new Tessie bags have received a more muted response. Though it's early days – the range has only been on sale for a couple of weeks – they haven't been popping up on street style blogs, nor have celebrities been conspicuously carrying them into fashion events.

Available in oak, oxblood and black – colours with truly broad appeal – the Tessie range is inspired by classics from the Mulberry archive, and the designs don't scare the horses.

The cheapest of the range – the Small Satchel (£495) – is a dinky cross-body pouch reminiscent of Celine's cute Box Shoulder bag. The Tessie (£595) is simple and sleek, occupying a similar space to Michael Kors's relatively affordable designs. The slouchy Hobo (£695) is an unstructured soft leather sack that tucks subtly under the arm. All are shapes that customers will feel vaguely familiar with already; they speak of quality and long-lasting appeal rather than boundary-breaking high fashion.

For years, Mulberry's quirky fashion shows and starry front rows – where Kate Moss would sit beside Alexa Chung and Lana Del Rey – were a key part of the brand's identity, and naming specific handbags after celebrities was a key motif. But the world has moved on from tribute "It" bags, as the success of more anonymous products by Kors, Coach and Celine attests.

As a brand, Mulberry hasn't entirely kissed glitz goodbye. At the most recent London fashion week, for example, the company launched a collection of youthful, idiosyncratic bags with Cara Delevingne, featuring brightly coloured camouflage-print rucksacks and quirky lion rivets.

The collaboration was a good move for stardust, pizzazz and publicity, but the company well knows that the business cannot rely on purple quilted rucksacks costing upwards of £1,000 to thrive. In current fashion, simple works – and the Tessie range is wilfully simple. The style set may not be obsessed, but commercially, pandering to the familiar and classic makes a lot of sense.
Quirky fashion brand Ted Baker has announced an 18% leap in sales as British fashion chains enjoyed their first full quarter of growth in four years.

Good weather and improving consumer confidence helped fashion retailers' sales increase 0.7% in May after lifts of 2.1% in April and 4.3% in March, according to the BDO High Street Sales tracker, which covers 85 mid-sized chains including French Connection, Gap, Hobbs and Paperchase.

Homewares stores saw even stronger growth with sales up 5.1% in May, according to the accountancy firm's regular survey, after increases of 7.8% in April and 2.1% in March.

Sophie Bevan, head of retail and wholesale at BDO, said: "The high street feels like it has turned a corner. The exciting thing is that not only is growth coming from all sectors, it's coming from the majority of retailers as opposed to just a minority boosting the overall performance.

"It's also encouraging that shoppers are getting excited about new season lines rather than just buying what they need in a sale." She said sales would have been even better if it had not been for the London tube strikes.

Ted Baker said its sales were boosted by a 48% rise in online sales in the most recent months. High street sales were up nearly 16% as the group opened new stores in Glasgow, Heathrow Terminal 2 and Philadelphia in the US.

Ray Kelvin, the company's chief executive, said the figures were not a reflection of any up-tick in the wider economy. "We are not a barometer. Our customers have an appetite for Ted Baker. As long as we look after the product, we increase the numbers in good time and bad," he said.

Analysts said that Ted Baker's sales growth was slightly ahead of expectations but the shares lost 4% to £19.35 as some investors felt the shares were becoming expensive.

Jonathan Pritchard, an analyst at Oriel Securities who downgraded Ted Baker shares from a buy to an add recommendation, said the pace of Ted Baker's sales growth had "barely flickered" and had not suffered any pain from the discounting activity of online retailer Asos, which stocks its clothing. But he added: "Sometimes brilliant companies just get close to full value."
You may have noticed that there is a small football tournament about to kick off in Brazil, and in at least one sense we will have home interest all the way to the final.

British bookmakers remain among the favourites to triumph in the World Cup – they'll take up to £600m online according to a new report by Regulus Insights and Sporting Index – and one of our teams, Betfair, will limber up for the big event this week by unveiling its annual results.

Over the past two years, under the guidance of boss Breon Corcoran, the company has been in decent form, with the shares up about 33%. Investors are now expecting more encouraging trading news this week, as well as some guidance on what the company plans to do with around £200m of cash.

Still, the fear from the terraces is that Corcoran's reign could prove analogous with Sven-Göran Eriksson's England career (save brushes with secretaries and fake sheikhs): he inherited such a mess that a few simple tweaks produced decent early results.

The big question is if Betfair, unlike Eriksson's England, can kick on from an encouraging early spell, as Corcoran's cost-cutting regime is surely reaching a conclusion, while there are tactical concerns about growing the betting exchange and diminishing bets from unregulated markets. Developing, as they say.

The City is littered with stories of people metaphorically losing their shirts – but very few of folk getting rich on the back of one.

But that's the tale of Ray Kelvin, the rather oddball founder of fashion chain Ted Baker, who for some reason obscures his face when photographed.

"We created a shirt that everyone in the country, for some wonderful reason, wanted to wear," he told the Telegraph last year. "It was during the period of Acid House and Garage, and they wore these bright acidy-colour shirts ... We floated the business [in 1997], really on the back of that shirt."

Kelvin's stake is now worth more than £300m, despite flogging about £20m of shares last year, which makes him just about the only seller in the Square Mile. His analyst fans are expecting more decent news when the company hands out its trading statement on Tuesday, with around 15% sales growth coming on top of a decent performance last year.

Still, if you're being picky, one concern remains. In March, Kelvin was awarded one of those "outstanding contribution to retail" awards – the type of gong that is frequently a sell sign.

So, how dicey is the hospital pass about to be received by Mike Coupe, the Sainsbury's commercial director who will succeed Justin King as chief executive next month?

We might get some clues this week as the grocer becomes the latest to address investors, following last week's Tesco and Morrisons horror shows.

You'll recall that just over a year ago, King was pledging himself to Sainsbury's for the "long term" – until U-turning more sharply than a dodgy supermarket trolley by admitting in January he was past his sell-by date.

By an astonishing coincidence, 36 unbroken quarters of growth then came to a crashing halt and the City is pencilling in another negative three months this time. Analysts at Jefferies reckon like-for-like sales will slip by 0.5% and add: "Sainsbury's sales performance remains extremely volatile. Impressive trading around major events is followed by quite uneventful sales in normal conditions."

To be fair, Coupe's hardly inheriting woes comparable to his two listed rivals – but the German discounters have changed the market, possibly for good. So King's legacy to his old pal is that the new Sainsbury's boss will have to live well with less, as the company (almost) used to tell customers. That doesn't seem like King's style.
Angela Ahrendts, former chief executive of Burberry, called her chief creative officer "one of this generation's greatest visionaries". We learned this week that Christopher Bailey, now her successor, was also the recipient last summer of one of this generation's greatest retention bonuses – a cool £15m.

The payment was quietly disclosed on page 104 of the fashion house's annual report. Bailey got 1m shares as an "exceptional" award last July when Burberry's share price, as now, was about £15. It was his second such "exceptional" award; he also got 350,000 shares in December 2010, worth about £4m at the time.

Cheap at the price, some Burberry investors may feel, if they have enjoyed the rise in the share price from 400p a decade ago and share Ahrendts's assessment of Bailey's talents.

OK, but aren't share-based awards worth many millions meant to be tied explicitly to future success via performance hurdles? In Bailey's case, his exceptional handouts merely required him to stay at Burberry "over three, four and five years from the date of grant".

Naturally, he also got a performance-related bundle when he succeeded Ahrendts last month. It amounted to 500,000 shares, worth £7.5m at current prices. In total, then, Bailey has had share awards worth £22.5m in the past year.

They pay themselves well at the top of the fashion world but, by the standards of a mid-ranking FTSE-100 firm (Burberry is worth £7bn), it's a lot. Bosses of titans such as Vodafone or GlaxoSmithKline would struggle to command awards of that size in such a short period.

The other oddity in Bailey's pay package is his £440,000 annual cash "allowance" in addition to his £1.1m salary. As mentioned here a few weeks ago, Burberry refuses to say what this "allowance" is for. It does not cover Bailey's clothes, cars or medical insurance – that much is spelled out. Instead, the pay report says the £440,000 was "agreed in his previous role, prior to his appointment as an executive director". That is not an explanation.

"I hope you find this report clear and comprehensive and I look forward to hearing your feedback," writes Ian Carter, head of the pay committee, in his introductory remarks.

Since you ask, Mr Carter, the answer is: no, some of this stuff is as clear as mud. Bailey, having arrived on the board after the end of the financial year, is not even included in the standard table listing directors' full interests in shares. Yet the note on page 104 reveals there are "a number" of share awards from past years "in addition" to the £15m and £4m. Why not just let investors see the full tally?

The point is not to gawp at Bailey's rewards, and wonder what else is yet to be disclosed. The real question for Burberry shareholders is whether the board, led by chairman Sir John Peace, has simply made an almighty bet on one man's genius.

Bailey is now both chief executive and chief creative officer, the two most important jobs at the company. He has been given £15m worth of freebie shares to encourage him to stay. And he gets a £440,000 annual allowance because he always has. Normal boardroom pay practices for FTSE-100 firms have been discarded.

Standard Chartered, where Peace is also chairman, suffered a 41% rebellion against its pay report last month. One top-10 fund manager said the bank's communication amounted to "making it up as they went along".

Before they vote on Burberry's report, investors should demand more transparency from Peace. Maybe there is a case for paying an "unconventional" chief executive – Bailey's own description – in an unconventional manner. But the argument has not been made in this annual report.

Here's one way to deal with choppy conditions in the flotation market: flog two-thirds of the company to nine institutions beforehand. AA's sale-cum-flotation is either a clever or a desperate tactic by the owners, the private equity firms CVC, Permira and Charterhouse.

The clever part is that they have avoided the risk of a flotation flop along the lines of Saga, the other firm that used to be housed under their Acromas banner. By accepting an offer of £930m for 67% of the AA, they have established a certain value.

The (possibly) desperate part lies in the fact that such certainty tends to require a discount. One suspects Aviva, BlackRock, GLG, Lansdowne and the other "cornerstone" investing institutions have done their homework. The AA is tricky to value because it is towing £3bn of debt. But it is a highly cash-generative business; it is the biggest operator in a market where size brings clear advantages; and profit margins on the main roadside assistance business were close to 50% at the trading level last year.

In other words, the AA's road to paying down that debt is long but visibility is excellent. The implied price tag of £1.38bn for 100% of the equity may turn out to be very good business for buyers who are prepared to commit for the long-term.

Bob Mackenzie, formerly of Green Flag and National Car Parks, is leading the new management team that took the deal to the institutions and found £930m of support. He has shown sharp manoeuvring skills on this deal.

The International Monetary Fund is (or used to be) zealously opposed to almost any form of capital control. So, when it argues for greater restrictions on mortgages to confront the risks of a dangerous housing bubble in London and the south-east, it is probably wise to listen.

A few banks are already tightening lending criteria. Lloyds, for example, said last month that it would limit mortgage lending to four times income for loans worth more than £500,000. But, rather than rely on banks to apply common sense, the Bank of England's financial policy committee should define what it regards as safe lending in a post-frenzy climate. And it should do so at this month's meeting.

As for Help to Buy, George Osborne's much-maligned scheme, it is probably not the greatest culprit. The data suggests very few homes in London are being bought with the help of government guarantees. But perceptions matter and Help to Buy may be encouraging the foolish thought among stretched borrowers that London houses are always a one-way bet. As a first step, cut the maximum value of qualifying houses from £600,000 to £300,000; then phase out Help to Buy altogether.

It is a shame TSB over-egged its new pay policy by claiming to have "taken inspiration" from John Lewis by making its staff "partners". The terminology doesn't work. Staff at John Lewis are partners because John Lewis isn employee-owned partnership. TSB after separation from Lloyds, will be owned by shareholders and gifting the staff £100 of shares does not make them partners.

Never mind, the analogy is better for its all-employee annual bonus scheme. Here recipients – "from CEO to frontline branch staff" – will receive the same percentage of salary as an annual cash bonus. Yes, that is roughly how John Lewis does things.

Inevitably, TSB executives, led by chief executive Paul Pester, will enjoy a separate bonus scheme on top, which is not John Lewis-like. But the sums are a step down from normal banking fare (Pester's all-in maximum earnings would be £1.687m) and TSB says bonuses will be tied to levels of customer service, rather than flogging financial products. Details will be crucial, but TSB's approach looks promising.
Global domination, it turns out, is harder to achieve than Asos's fan club had thought. The march towards annual sales of £2.5bn, from about £1bn currently, had been pencilled in as a four-year exercise to be conducted with steady profit margins of 6.5%-7%. That was the assumption that underpinned the bizarre and breezy willingness of some investors to pay almost 100 times earnings to get a slice of the action.

If you pay those prices, you're asking for trouble. It has duly arrived, in the form of Asos's warning that its profit margin this financial year won't be anything like 6.5%. It will be just 4.5%. Bang goes about a third of this year's expected pre-tax profits. Forget £65m, the outcome will be more like £45m.

What out-of-left-field mischief is at work? Despite Asos chief executive Nick Robertson's attempt to blame "an unusual combination of factors," the explanation is mundane if you're in the game of selling goods to 200 countries: old-fashioned currency movements, specifically the strength of sterling.

The Barnsley-based firm, operating off a sterling cost base and a sterling pricing structure, has been forced to discount heavily to compete in countries with weaker currencies – Russia, for example. What's more, when surplus stock is cleared in the UK, where sales are subject to VAT, the trade carries lower profit margins.

In the scheme of things, this is merely a serious setback for Asos rather than a catastrophe. The introduction of so-called zonal pricing may help in time. But the manner in which the firm was dragged into heavy discounting ought to alarm investors. Maybe a steady profit margin of 6.5% is simply outside management's control when you're attempting to expand internationally at a rate of 30% a year.

But Thursday's one-third collapse in the share price to £31.20 is definitely a catastrophe for those investors who were chasing the stock at £70 early this year. What were they thinking? At that point, Asos was worth £6bn, or about 90 times expected profits before Thursday's heavy revision.

Even now, at £31.20, the stock is hardly cheap – the valuation represents about 75 times expected earnings of 40p a share. Would you really pay that for a business that has now had two profit warnings – a mild one in March and now a thumper – in the space of three months?

Asos remains a great pioneering business – a UK internet champion in clothing. But the risks and potential rewards for investors still look wildly out of sync.
Fashion company Burberry handed Christopher Bailey, promoted to chief executive last month, a one-off award of shares worth almost £15m last summer.

The award of the shares, which are not related to performance, was revealed in the annual report, which also showed that Bailey was handed another one-off award of shares in December 2010 worth around £4m at the time.

The disclosure of the share handouts follows the revelation last month that Bailey, previously the company's chief creative officer, was handed a golden hello in shares worth up to £7.6m. Following his promotion to chief executive, to replace Angela Ahrendts who has joined Apple, Bailey was awarded 500,000 shares, which are related to performance and could pay out between 2017 and 2019.

The share price last night was £14.95.

The UK-born executive, who remains both the chief creative and chief executive officer, is also receiving £440,000 of cash allowances on top of a £1.1m salary and annual cash bonus of up to £2.2m.

In total Bailey could receive up to £10.3m this year, depending on the company's performance.

The company provides little disclosure about how many shares Bailey – who is in his 13th year at Burberry – owns or could own through share schemes. But it does reveal that – well before he became chief executive – he was handed 1m shares in July 2013 and 350,000 in December 2010, which he will receive between 2015 and 2018 and which are not related to performance.

In the annual report, Ahrendts - who is holding on to two share bonuses worth up to £6.2m and is receiving £40m in shares from her employer Apple - writes that she is looking forward to watching the company develop.

Sir John Peace, chairman of the company and nominations committee, said in the annual report that Bailey had been appointed to the enlarged role because of "unique qualities and deep experience" and that head hunters were not used to find a successor to Ahrendts.

Other annual reports released on Thursday show that the boss of Marks & Spencer, Marc Bolland, missed out on bonuses and rejected a pay rise. His salary was unchanged at £970,000 and his total pay down from £2.1m to £1.6m.
Chinese shoppers could almost double the amount they spend to £3.5tn in four years with clothing offering the best opportunity for western retailers.

As online fashion retailer Asos struggles to get a foothold in the fast-growing market, a report from consultancy Conlumino suggests that £212bn will be spent on clothing in China in 2018, more than double the £103bn in 2013. Growth is being driven by young Chinese women adopting western lifestyles, with more working and taking on senior roles and putting off having children until their late 20s, giving them disposable income and making them more likely to spend.

"The growth of the internet and social media have generated global fashion trends and this has made it far easier for international fashion brands to expand," said Maureen Hinton, Conlumino global research director.

But China has not been an easy market for western retailers to tackle. Asos shares dived after it admitted that losses at its fledgling operation in the country reach £9m this year rather than the £6m previously indicated. Other retailers from Tesco to DIY group Kingfisher and even luxury brands such as Burberry have not found the market as easy to crack as much bigger local operators put up a strong fight and savvy consumers hunt for good deals.
The streets of east London looked more vibrant and outlandish than ever this weekend, when the world's biggest student fashion event – Graduate Fashion Week – opened its doors at Brick Lane's Truman Brewery, a new location in the beating heart of modern British fashion.

Now in its 23rd year, GFW is best known for the wackiest of its students' creations: the gimp masks and cellophane-wrapped naked bottoms most likely to make the front pages of newspapers. But for the event's organisers the showcase has a rather more sensible purpose: to ensure that BA fashion students find work after graduation.

Over four days, the work of 1,000 students from 42 universities is displayed in 21 catwalk shows, while dozens of talks and seminars are held, from advice on PR from Vivienne Westwood to tips about buying and merchandising from the event's sponsors, George at Asda.

"Everybody wants to be a designer," says GFW chairman Rob Templeman. "But there are more than 800,000 16- to 24-year-olds out of work in the UK, so it's important to remember that there are lots of good careers available in the industry." On the final day, prizes will be awarded, including the top "gold" prize of £10,000 and the opportunity to design a collection for George. The event also offers the chance for students to meet industry scouts. "We very much encourage other retailers, suppliers and manufacturers to attend," says Fiona Lambert, vice-president of George. "There are some incredibly talented young people out there and they need opportunities."

GFW was conceived to give fashion students from outside London a chance to showcase their work in the capital. Although graduates of the MA courses at Central Saint Martins College and the Royal College of Art do not show at the event, it has spawned more than its share of successes, with previous award winners including Matthew Williamson, Julien MacDonald, Burberry CEO and creative director Christopher Bailey, Stella McCartney and Giles Deacon.

The new east London location looks likely to boost awareness even more. "Ticket sales are up by 20%," says Templeman. "We get around 25,000 attendees most years, but this year we are projecting at least 30,000. Brick Lane is the centre of the creative district. It's also a lot more accessible than Earl's Court."

Certainly, for Fashion East founder Lulu Kennedy – who discovered designers including Jonathan Saunders and Richard Nicoll – the move seems significant. "I never made it over to GFW when it was miles away in west London; I tended to look at images online," she says. "But now it's based at the old Truman Brewery, which is where my studio is, I'll definitely be checking out shows. It's exciting to have it in east London, which makes loads more sense, as this is where fashion is actually happening."

While GFW may not have the prestige of the Central Saint Martins MA show – which runs in London Fashion Week – its breadth and diversity of talent has long been taken seriously by the industry. "This is the germination of the seeds of future fashion. That's the deal," says Gordon Richardson, creative director of Topman. "It's crucial." Former GFW winner Julien Macdonald says: "Winning GFW launched my career, and it was a proud moment because the competition is there."

The award's first winner, Christopher Bailey, now one of the most powerful people in British fashion, agrees: "We have the most exceptional design talent coming out of our colleges and I salute their energy, their talent and their well-earned and deserved global reputation."

Last year's "gold" award winner, Lauren Smith from Edinburgh College of Art, won £20,000 and the chance to design a collection for George. She describes the experience as "beyond amazing". The money is still in the bank and Smith is considering putting it towards launching her own business when she finishes her MA.

Work: Woodgate's knitwear is inspired by "Buddhist Mandala, African tribal patterns and the Cornish landscape." She adds: "One of the biggest influences has been the processes of knit, crochet and macramé, which have allowed me to develop my own stitch patterns and creativity." Her GFW collection has so far required 1,700 hours of knitting ("and still one jumper to go").

The future: "I would love to work with [experimental knitwear queen] Sandra Backlund, who has had a massive influence on me, she says"

Work: McNair's pretty, commercial prints are inspired by "imagery collected of washing lines, recreated in abstract and geometric forms".

Experience: Internships at Burberry, Oliver Knipe and Topshop and a three-month placement with Intrex in China. "After only two weeks at Burberry, I could have stayed there forever. It was such an amazing environment," says McNair.

The future: McNair will work at Abercrombie and Fitch in Columbus, Ohio, for a year from February, after which she plans to launch her own label.

Work: Structured dresses featuring strong silhouettes and laser-cut geometric shapes. Cadar takes inspiration from contemporary art and the vibrant colours of India.

The future: Plans to pursue an MA in design. The ideal audience for her work is the people of London: "I love the quirky, fun and free sense of style you find here."

Work: Pink shearling jackets "inspired by the expeditions of Scott of the Antarctic – I've taken the main aspects of the clothing and created a collection people can wear without the need to go to the South Pole".

Experience: Two months as an intern at Banana Republic in New York working on their spring/summer 2014 collection,.

The future: Aims "to be a creative director of an established fashion brand".
The fashion industry is in a bad state: fatal fires, building collapses, horror stories about environmental destruction and endemic exploitation. So what can be done? Does data monitoring technology offer a solution to these problems?

For the past few decades, determining standards in factories has depended on corporations hiring third parties to carry out audits. Malcolm Guy, founder of continuous data company Supply Link puts it bluntly: corporate audits have failed. Indeed Rana Plaza had been audited twice and served with a clean bill of health by Primark. In Pakistan in 2012 the Ali Enterprises factory fire killed 289 garment workers – despite the factory having been recently inspected and certified by Social Accountability International.

Instead of corporate audits, which can be falsified and quickly become out of date, Guy argues that the fashion industry should be aiming for a constant stream of data providing a clear image of what is happening in factories.

Continuous data – also known as live data – involves collecting information that can be used to monitor energy use, water and waste management, carbon production, and building health and safety. The idea is that constantly collecting data ensures it is timely, accurate, and unhampered. In China continuous data about smog and pollution is recorded and made public.

Schemes can also involve monitoring people. Continuous data can answer questions like: what is the staff turnover at a factory? How many hours are staff working? How efficient are they? With regards to health and safety, during a recent Guardian live chat Amisha Ghadiali, co-founder of Provenance, described the option of brands using heat maps to detect overcrowding. There is also the option of installing cameras in factories to monitor working conditions.

Monitoring people however, is very different to monitoring the environment and raises numerous ethical issues, particularly for somewhere like Bangladesh – a country that according to Privacy International, has no general data protection act.

Multinational fashion corporations select the countries where they manufacture primarily by production costs. Part of ensuring low production costs is keeping wages low, which in turn requires the hampering or outlawing of trade unions and civil society.

When it comes to data collection, Privacy International points out that intelligence services have long "targeted trade unions and other organisations working for progressive social change". In a country like Bangladesh where being a trade union organiser can attract harassment and violence, concerns about monitoring factory workers need to be taken extremely seriously.

There is also the question of whether constant monitoring will really improve workers' lives and happiness? Are we asking people in Bangladesh to submit to something we would not accept in our own workplaces? How do you reach agreement about what is acceptable when those most affected by data capturing have the least say in the process?

A data management consultant in London, who asked to remain anonymous, outlined some of the problems: "There is this constant idea that more is better. While there is not necessarily anything wrong with collecting vast amounts of data, you have to make sure there are protections in place to ensure privacy. This is not scaremongering, when it comes to protecting vulnerable people you can't just give their data away."

In light of data collection revelations around the NSA in the United States and GCHQ in the UK, data collection is an inflammatory topic. "Once it's privatised, data can be used to target you in a way you don't want to be targeted," she continues. "Companies and governments can start profiling you, and your privacy and rights can be seriously compromised."

A major danger for unions would be cameras in and around factories, and there are also major privacy issues here for brands. Supply Link for example has not yet installed a camera in a factory and is wary of doing so. For someone like Malcolm Guy, the ethical case around data has not yet been resolved, and needs a wide social discussion to determine an ethical framework. "When people [ask] me 'what's keeping you awake at night, what's limiting this?' I say, well, ultimately it's the ethics, the human aspect of this."

Data collection should not to be used as an excuse to sideline health and safety legislation and trade unions. Worker-led inspections, like the Bangladesh Accord are a vital element in ensuring building safety, and technology is not a substitute for democratic structures and labour laws that allow workers to protect themselves. The Caracol Industrial Park in Haiti for example cost a staggering $424m (£253m) to build, yet is a deeply exploitative environment.

The philosopher and Emeritus professor at the University of Sussex, István Mészáros cautions against focusing on technology as the key to solving the world's problems. There is, he believes, a greater need to question who currently has control of science and technology, and why. The key question is not which technologies might help solve the problems of the fashion industry but how to change the direction of technology away from its current narrow focus on profit maximisation.

Arundhati Roy sums it up in her fascinating new book Capitalism: A Ghost Story. She describes a "technocratic obsession" with gathering data – "as though it were a lack of information that is the cause of world hunger, and not colonialism, debt, and skewed profit-oriented corporate policy".

Online retailer Asos is backing the expansion of a training programme designed to rebuild skills in the UK clothing manufacturing industry amid hopes that retailers are "reshoring" more orders.

Fashion Enter, a manufacturer that first set up a workshop in London's Haringey in 2008 with just eight workers, now employs 84 people, including 48 machinists, and produces up to 7,500 garments a week for companies including Asos and Marks & Spencer. It currently trains about 20 people every six weeks in basic stitching skills and is working with another 50 apprentices on more complex garment technology skills such as pattern cutting.

But from next year, with the help of funding from Haringey council and the promise of more orders from Asos, it is planning to expand in order to train more than 1,000 people a year in a range of qualifications from stitching to the more technical aspects of clothing production including quality control, pattern cutting and fabric inspection. It is also aiming to extend production to 16,000 garments a week, as it gets more space to train new machinists beyond basic skills.

Jenny Holloway, director of Fashion Enter, admits it is unlikely that all of her new trainees will find work within the UK fashion industry, but she says the UK is becoming more viable for clothing manufacture amid a new awareness of the total cost of sourcing abroad, from transport to paying hotel bills for staff. "In fast fashion there is no substitute for turning a garment around in two or three weeks, as we can do," she says.

Holloway adds that there are now 32 fashion factories in the area, and more planning to open, as demand for UK manufactured clothing hots up.

Nick Walkley, chief executive of Haringey council, adds: "It is easy to see regeneration as just about places like Hoxton with people drinking lattes, but it can also be about artisans making bread or garments at an international scale or single pieces. This area has a real opportunity to deliver quite large-scale employment."
With Memorial Day and summer come a few other traditions: swimsuit shopping, skimpier clothes – and with them, a host of body issues.

So who wants to look up into a store window and, already dissatisfied with one's body, see a mannequin with a concave stomach and visible ribs? 



Does that spur the impulse to buy out of aspiration? Or is it a turnoff? 



La Perla apparently thought its chic customers – who drop hundreds of dollars on high-status underthings – would relate to, or admire, such a vision.

It didn’t quite work out that way. “How does #LaPerla think ribs on a mannequin is ok?! @SethMatlins,” fumed influential tech entrepreneur Michael Rudoy on Twitter, tagging truth-in-advertising activist Seth Matlins.

Score one for Matlins. La Perla quickly removed the mannequins, and tweeted that they wouldn’t be used in another La Perla boutique. The company added that it is updating its entire mannequin collection.

“The mannequin photographed has been removed from the store and will not be used again by any La Perla boutique. We are in the process of redesigning all La Perla stores with a new concept image and the mannequins that are currently displayed in our US stores will no longer be used. We appreciate and value everyone's comments, thank you for bringing this to our attention.”

Yet La Perla is not a one-time offender – several weeks ago the lingerie company’s Instagram featured a model beside a mannequin with impossibly skinny legs.

“I think it is much worse to have their ribs showing,” said Jean Kilbourne, a former model and honorary member of Wellesley’s Centers for Women. 



But even Kilbourne will tell you: “The extremity of it catches our attention, but this is really not new.”

In fact, it’s becoming more of a trend: expect the impossibly slim, the white and the sinewy to dominate chic windows.

Typical mannequin measurements, excluding the very chesty or bootylicious, are an almost impossible ideal: around 6ft tall, 34in bust, 24in waist, 34in hips.

Two large mannequin suppliers said their most popular color is alabaster white, although it used to be “flesh tone” – that is, flesh-toned if you are white. And both said their clients’ desires are trending toward more “sculpted” mannequins that show off “musculature”. 



“If you do something that's sort of a thinner mannequin, you're doing that one group that says it's too thin,” said Goldsmith’s creative director and CEO Dan Evans. His company supplies mannequins to many high-end department stores, including Nordstrom, Bergdorf Goodman and Macy’s. Evans has also worked with La Perla. 



The enduring best-seller of Goldsmith’s collection, he said, is the “classic” mannequin. The very detailed female model doesn’t have visible ribs; instead, she has six-pack abs. 



That's OK, say suppliers.



“Most people are looking at the garment, and not what the mannequin represents,” said Barry Rosenberg, partner at Mondo Mannequins, which can produce up to 2,000 mannequins a day.

“I mean, I'm not going to tell you anything you wouldn't already know. Why are models 6ft tall with small breasts, and extremely long legs? Because they look the best in the garment,” said Rosenberg.

Rosenberg laughed at the description of the possibly too-skinny ribby mannequins. 



“We don't make mannequins that are 5ft 3in and 160lbs,” he said.

The average American woman is 5ft 3in and 166lbs, according to the CDC.

The industry’s also been questioned about using larger mannequins, as Evans noted. Dame Sally Davies, England’s chief medical officer, told the Telegraph she felt size-16 mannequins introduced in Britain’s Debenhams department store “normalized” obesity.

Goldsmith's Evans suggests it's not his choice. "At that point, the fashion industry and our customer dictate those sizes,” he said.



The trend is towards thinner and ribby mannequins promote unhealthy body image, as many truth-in-advertising advocates will tell you.

“It's bad enough that they're so thin,” said Kilbourne. “It makes them look even more anorexic. Having the ribs showing is a sign of starvation, malnutrition, eating disorders. It's appalling,” she said.

Other unrealistic mannequins? In Venezuela and Miami Beach, Florida, chesty mannequins look like they’ve had silicone implants. In Gap stores, a Twitter account called @InMySkinnyDream chronicled Gap’s toothpick-legged dolls by the “Always Skinny” jean.

“One of the big – and I’ve been talking about this forever – is it all becomes invisible in a way because we're so used to it, and if its brought to people's attention, that sort of breaks through the clutter,” said Kilbourne, the body-image advocate. “I think it's pretty freakish for ribs to be showing.”
Retailers including H&M, New Look and Zara owner Inditex are to meet the Cambodian government early next week to seek better treatment of clothing factory workers in the country.

The meeting, which will also be attended by international union IndustriALL, comes as workers campaigning for an increase in the national minimum wage and improved conditions in factories have faced detention and intimidation in a country where few trade unions operate. A series of mass faintings at clothing factories have also highlighted poor conditions.

IndustriALL's general secretary, Jyrki Raina, who will be attending the meeting and also representing the ITUC and Uni Global Union, said: "Despite assurances from the government in February, there have since been unprecedented levels of intimidation, violence and a declining respect for the rule of law, which together constitute a grave attack on union and worker rights.

"The concerted message from global unions and brands to the Cambodian government is clear: political stability and respect for human and worker rights are essential to maintaining sourcing in Cambodia."

In the past few months striking garment workers, who want the monthly minimum wage to double to $160, have faced brutal action by police with at least five workers left dead. Some workers involved in the protests have been dismissed and some factory owners have responded to protests with lawsuits against union leaders.

An estimated 400,000 people, mostly women, work in Cambodia's garment factories which are the country's biggest export earner. Brands have warned that unrest caused by poor treatment of workers threatens Cambodia's future as a "stable sourcing location". Pressure on retailers to ensure the safety of factory workers has also increased in the wake of the Rana Plaza factory collapse in Bangladesh in 2013 in which more than 1,100 workers died.

• Did the Rana Plaza factory disaster change your fashion buying habits?
"My new role is an unconventional role and my background is not one of a traditional CEO," declared Christopher Bailey as he set out his stall as the new boss of Burberry. Fair enough. He may be a breath of fresh air, and it should not be remarkable that a fashion company has chosen to appoint its creative guru as its chief executive.

But it would be a disgrace if a healthy disregard for convention is used to excuse the award to Bailey of a mysterious £440,000 annual "allowance". It's not as if he's badly paid on the normal stuff.

He'll get a £1.1m salary, the chance to earn a £2.2m bonus every year. And promotion yielded a performance-related golden hello in the form of £7.6m in shares. So what's the "allowance" meant to cover? Burberry refuses to say.

Is Bailey permitted to spend the sum, which works out at £1,235 a day, as he wishes? If so, it's a second salary, in non-pensionable form, and Burberry is silly to pretend otherwise.

If the £440,000 is meant to cover the necessity of wearing Burberry clothes, does Bailey really need a new outfit every day?

The great man himself is not taking questions. He declined to speak to the press on the day Burberry announced its full-year results. That, presumably, is another quirk of his "unconventional" approach to the job.

Actually, though, it's Sir John Peace, Burberry chairman, and Ian Carter, head of the remuneration committee, who should explain the "allowance". Most FTSE 100 companies are shifting towards greater transparency on pay but Burberry seems to be running in the opposite direction.

Standard Chartered, where Peace is also chairman, suffered a 41% rebellion on its pay policy the other week and fund managers complain about the bank's arrogant approach to communications.

Peace, it seems, has learned nothing from that episode.
Professor Louise Wilson, who was a long-serving course director at Central Saint Martins at University of the Arts London, died on Friday at the age of 52.

She had been credited with helping shape the careers of the designers Alexander McQueen and Stella McCartney, and was recognised for her influence on fashion with an OBE in 2008.

Wilson, who leaves a partner Timmi and son TJ, was also recently included on a list of 125 of the most "intelligent, empowered and inspirational" women by The Lady magazine.

In a statement, the college said: "Louise has been an inspirational person both within the college and the wider world of fashion.

"Since becoming course director for the MA fashion course in 1992, she has taught a huge proportion of the world's leading fashion designers and her course continues to produce talented ground-breaking graduates.

"Her commitment to her students and passion for creative excellence are legendary. Her deep understanding of fashion and her drive for funding for bursaries, facilities and opportunities are part of what made her such an extraordinary educator.

"Louise's legacy will live on at CSM through her former students and current teaching colleagues who were so close to her. Central Saint Martins is grateful to have been able to enjoy the fruits of Louise's great talent for educating for the last 22 years and will support her staff and students as they go forward from here."

McCartney was among those paying tribute to the tutor, described by many as "legendary".

Writing on Twitter, McCartney said: "What an inspiration and force in fashion. I send my deep sympathy to your family.

"No one will ever replace you because you were a true one off. Louise we will all miss you r.i.p xx stella"

Caroline Rush, chief executive of the British Fashion Council, added: "Prof Louise Wilson, I can't believe you have gone. You were much loved and respected. A legend and an inspiration. RIP."
Young designers need to establish an online presence early on and embrace technology, as it has become an "essential part" of the fashion business, according to the chief executive of the British Fashion Council.

"Technology has become so much more accessible and ingrained in the way we do business, shop and communicate," Caroline Rush told the Decoded Fashion summit in London.



She said technology had become an essential part of the business and as a result of adopting online platforms and developing their e-commerce, many designers are now selling directly to the consumer at a much faster pace than would have been the course traditionally.

"It's really about bringing the fashion and tech sectors together and providing opportunities to help young designers get online – that is helping them to do it in the right way, to make sure there's mentors around them so that it is successful and they're learning... from challenges and hurdles that come with any retail platform."

Rush added that fashion businesses that "get it right" could grow more quickly and see better profits. "In London, people are seeing that there is a really great movement going on in the fashion and tech world. If [the BFC] can support that to grow, it is an added feather in our cap for the fashion industry.

"We're also seeing lots of tech firms who are coming to work with designers so that the tech that they have can be put into really beautiful products and that's an exciting moment for us," Rush told the summit attendees, a mixture of industry insiders and enthusiasts from the tech, retail, marketing and fashion sectors.

Henry Holland, the designer who first started selling his bold T-shirt designs on Myspace, said he found the main challenge to be keeping up with the development of technology.

Fellow designer Mary Katrantzou, know for her detailed print creations, said designers allowed time to build a brand creatively but "maybe we don't necessarily have the time, network or knowledge about what to do technologically".

She also highlighted a desire for technology that could make studio life easier. Asked what would be a dream app, Rush replied that an app tracking the reputation brands are building would be much coveted by the BFC. Katrantzou said she would like an app that could offer a pool of logistics information, providing price comparison costs that she says would "save a lot of time across the company".

The British designer Lulu Guinness said designers should not be afraid of incorporating technology into their brand. "You’ve got to be fearless, I think you get left behind otherwise," she said. "You've just got to go with it – use your intelligence, your common sense. If you’re a fashion retailer you should be embracing every single type of technology you can."

Guinness was enthusiastic about the prospect of 3D printing, even declaring it would be a perfect fit for the Perspex lip-shaped purse her brand has become known for. She was quick to add that some items would still need to be produced by the hands of craftsmen.

The British Fashion Council also released a report on Tuesday entitled Commercialising Creativity – Creating a Model for Success for British Fashion Designers, which said young British designers should emulate Silicon Valley and view the launch of a fashion brand as an entrepreneurial venture.

The report echoes comments from Liz Bacelar, the founder of Decoded Fashion, who told the Guardian this year that “designers need to launch like startups”. The release also marks a new partnership between the London Business School and the British Fashion Council, which was also announced on Tuesday.
"O fat white woman whom nobody loves / Why do you walk through the fields in gloves?"

These lines by Frances Cornford "To a fat lady seen from a train" surely epitomise outsize unhappiness. Poor fat woman: unloved by designers, manufacturers, and shops, tramping on in a Vogue-inspired attempt at self-reduction, wearing gloves in the fields in absolute despair. "If I can't look like Jean Shrimpton, at least I'll look respectable." Defensive overdressing is the saddest thing of all.

A quarter of the women in Britain are fat. Their hips range from 42 inches to five feet. And judging by the response to Elizabeth Gundrey's column ("send me a postcard non-standard women, please"), almost all the outsize women in Britain read the Guardian.

Manufacturers cannot go on ignoring such an army. In fact, specialist outsize firms have made a calculation: their annual sales of dresses alone should be rising from two million to as high as nine million.

For the sake of fat women, sixteen manufacturers are running a sales campaign. They held a fashion show. Philip Kunick, chairman of Outsize Fashion, told svelte young fashion writers that the group's foremost aim was to upgrade outsize clothes so that outsize women everywhere could get satisfaction "at least as good as their slimmer sisters." On came outsize models: smiling ones, skipping ones, a thoroughgoing grande dame, which all went to show, I think, that fatness strikes all sorts.

The show was well meaning and the compere reassuring to large women as well as "the more comfortable girl". He told us that plump girls keep their husbands, skinny girls are apt to lose them; thin women have sad skin, plump girls look radiant. "If you're a large girl you might as well look happy."

The fashion show was kindly, and this may have raised morale. But I doubt if it will make large girls much happier in the long-term. These firms are just not answering fat women's constant pleas for smart clothes, plain clothes, clothes that feel in fashion. Printed brushed nylon does not help a sturdy shape: a picture-frame neckline exaggerates big busts.

Outsize manufacturers are making big mistakes. When their clothes are not just tactless, they are uniformly drab. No wonder fat women, disenchanted with big stores and "fuller figure" clothes shops, have dresses made in private. No wonder they feel cross. No wonder millions mope about, unfashionable in gloves.
Young British designers should emulate Silicon Valley and Stella McCartney and view the launch of a fashion brand as an entrepreneurial venture – not solely a creative endeavour – according to a report published today by The British Fashion Council.

Titled Commercialising Creativity – Creating a Model for Success for British Fashion Designers, the paper claims that there is a dearth of guidance available to fashion designers starting their own businesses, an anomaly in an industry that employs almost 800,000 people and makes £26bn annually.

"Our ambition is that future generations of designers will understand how to create a business plan and source investment in the same way the tech industry does," said BFC CEO Caroline Rush. Rush added that the findings would help young designers "evaluate the kind of business they want to be and the questions they should be addressing from the start."

Written by Alessandra Basso and Alejandra Caro, MBA students from London Business School, the report is the result of hours of interviews with designers, retailers, advisors, PRs and investors, and gives seven key recommendations for fashion business growth. They are:

• Behave as a business, not as an artisan.

• Develop the brand's identity and support it with a marketing and communications plan.

• Understand and address the challenges of production.

• Understand the importance of cashflow, funding and financing.

It includes case studies on the story behind British fashion success stories including Nicholas Kirkwood – the shoe designer in which luxury conglomerate LVMH has recently acquired a stake – and McCartney, concluding that much of her success has been due to her unique position as a brand. With McCartney's committed ethical stance – using organic materials to create luxury products, including non-leather shoes – she "sells a sense of moral satisfaction to her customers, and people love her for it, "the paper says. The report also addresses issues such as finding the right business partner and understanding the importance of costing. Joseph Velosa chairman Matthew Williamson says: "We dedicate many meetings to analysing costing and set up prices because if you get that wrong, you potentially lose thousands of pounds ... If something doesn't make a margin, unless it's a very beautiful piece, you take it out of the collection." It also urges the government to consider giving tax incentives for investment in fashion design and access to funding to help designers' businesses grow.

Today's release marks a new partnership between the London Business School and the British Fashion Council. Through this relationship, "we aim to encourage more MBA graduates to pursue rewarding careers in the sector, working with British designers to assist them in fulfilling their potential for growth," said Rush.
The boho maxi dresses, flowing blouses and feminine tailoring have little to do with the androgynous shapes or minimalist cuts that have been strutting down the catwalks of late.

But the first Kate Moss collection for Topshop in four years, which is more reminiscent of the model drinking wine on a yacht, or smoking a fag on a night out in Soho, seems only likely to cement her role as national institution. As the supermodel described it to the Guardian recently, the latest range is a "wardrobe autobiography". As Topshop's website puts it, "the icon is back".

Moss launched the range at Topshop's flagship Oxford Circus branch in central London on Tuesday night, where small shoppers' queues began to form at around 1pm to get their hands on her 15th collection - the first since 2010 - for the brand.

Shoppers lined the pavement outside Topshop on Oxford Street, spilling into the road, much to the bemusement of tourists and the chagrin of stewards dispatched to keep them from getting run over. Shortly before 6.30pm, Moss herself was unveiled in the shop window, presented by Radio1 DJ Nick Grimshaw, and soon doors opened to shoppers, some of whom had been waiting for over five hours.

Emma, 26, was first in the queue at 1pm and first at the tills. She spent £240, the prized item being a leather jacket costing £190. "She's got such a great variety, different themes running through the collection. I didn't try anything on, I just went for it," she said.

Tina, 45, from Buckinghamshire queued for two hours. "I wanted the leather jacket for me, then my daughter wanted something, then my niece said 'get something for me." She spent £1,000 and bought eight items. "I think it's worth it because Moss is unique and the clothes are instantly recognisable as her. Also I've bought her Topshop stuff in the past and it lasts a long time. You'll be wearing it for years because it's a classic piece."

Not everyone was there to grab a Moss item. Jenny, from London, found herself at the back of a three and a half hour queue to return a pair of shoes. 'I'm not really a fan of Kate Moss,' she explained, much to her daughter's exasperation

At a side entrance surrounded by red carpet a group of Italian tourists were content to watch the show.

Amy Moosah, a 27-year-old stylist, was among those in the queue. She liked the "elegant and bohemian" range, adding that Moss was the model of her generation.

Designed with Katy England, the collection features 40 pieces and centres heavily on a summer beach ethos - fringed kaftans and beaded shirts. There are also Kate classics - an asymmetrical yellow dress she wore in 2003 is repeated here, also in black and green. Great Gatsby-esque shapes pop up in high-waisted silk trousers and a black jumpsuit. And befitting a woman who, despite cultivating a flourishing business built solely on her personal brand and is best known for her love of partying, the latest collection suggests hedonism, not workwear. It is notable that most of the collection will also be stocked by Net-A-Porter, the online luxury retailer who don't usually do high street.

"I have really missed being involved in the design process, and working with the team at Topshop," said Moss, a regular holiday companion of Topshop boss Sir Philip Green. "I am very excited to create a new collection that bears my name. Now more than ever, with London being at the forefront of fashion, as it feels like I'm back home working with Topshop."

This latest collection marks the end of a four-year hiatus for Moss on designing duty. First launched in 2007, the debut Topshop collection was initially deemed a risk, coming as it did a year after Metropolitan police dropped charges against the model in the wake of footage of her allegedly snorting lines of cocaine.

But the success of her first collection - which she unveiled by posing in the window of Topshop, laughing and smiling as punters elbowed each other out of the way to get in - was a significant part of the great Moss comeback of 2007. From dropped modelling gigs and cancelled contracts to a current net worth of over £8m, according to Forbes, Moss is more successful than most models half her age. Though at 40 she shows no sign of leaving the catwalk, her return to designing coincides with a role as contributing fashion editor at British Vogue, for whom she styled her first photoshoot earlier this year.

Primark, the fashion store that brought the £3 jumper dress to the British shopper, is to open in the US as it attempts to become a global chain.

The budget retailer, owned by Associated British Foods, will open its first store in Boston, Massachusetts, in 2015 and said it was in negotiations to open up to eight further stores in north-east America, with warehousing to support them.

America has proved to be a leap too far for most UK retailers: Marks & Spencer, WH Smith, Sainsbury's and, most recently, Tesco have all seen their stateside ventures founder. However, fashion chains Topshop and Ted Baker have found favour with US shoppers.

Primark said it had decided to take its concept to the US after extensive research.

Primark has defied the recession to become one of the fastest-growing retail businesses in western Europe. It has more than 270 stores in nine countries, including Spain, Portugal, Germany and the Netherlands. In the past year it has opened over 1m sq ft of new retail space as it took its brand of cut-price fashion to France with stores in Marseille and Dijon.

"We think we have as differentiated and attractive a proposition in the US as we have in continental Europe and the British Isles. We think we have something special to offer," said George Weston, ABF chief executive.

The 70,000sq ft Boston store – as big as an out-of-town UK superstore – will open at the end of next year.

In the year ahead, Weston said, Primark expected to open about another 1m sq ft of space across Europe and the UK. It wants to open stores in York, Milton Keynes, Bath and Canterbury and also plans a big expansion of its Birmingham outlet.

Weston said Primark had been encouraged to go to the US by its experience in different markets in Europe, and heading over the Atlantic looked more attractive than the Far East or eastern Europe.

"It seemed a better option than anywhere else," he said.

The US venture is an ambitious new chapter for the retailer, which began life in 1969 as a single shop in Dublin under the name Penneys – the name it still trades under in Ireland. Primark's latest results show no sign of growth slipping: profits jumped by more than a quarter to £298m in the six months to the start of March, while the company rang through sales worth £2.3bn – up 14% up on last year.

But Primark's success in feeding shoppers' appetite for throwaway fashion has come under increasing scrutiny since the Rana Plaza factory collapse in Bangladesh, which claimed the lives of 1,133 garment workers and left more than 2,500 injured. The Primark label was among 28 western brands found in the rubble, as well as the UK's Bonmarché, Canada's Loblaw and Spain's Mango. Primark has paid more than any other retailer into a UN-backed compensation scheme, but on the first anniversary of the disaster this week the fund has raised only $15m (£9m), well short of its $40m target.

Anna McMullen of the Labour Behind the Label campaign said Primark had been engaged in the compensation process, but needed to rethink its business model. "They are driving a fast fashion agenda that has a negative effect on workers' rights around the world. The way that they and a lot of their main competitors are driving down prices to seek ever cheaper places and ever lower wages … to make the price of their product cheaper has had a really negative effect on the whole industry."

"Now they are entering the US market I can imagine that is only going to exacerbate the problem. It is all well and good to be involved in clearing up the mess, but it is as important to be a retailer that tries to drive change as well through normal business practice."

Weston said Primark had now carried out structural surveys on factories it used in Bangladesh and had a team in the country to monitor conditions for workers producing its clothes.

He said: "Fire risk remains an issue everywhere, so does the payment of overtime and bullying of staff," however, he said: "We have learned plenty of lessons after Rana Plaza, I hope the rest of the industry has too."

Shares in ABF were up almost 9% to £29.63 on Wednesday as investors eyed up entry into the huge US market, as well as the profits bonanza.

Maureen Hinton, retail analyst at Conlumino, said Primark was highly likely to succeed in America. "Young fashion is global now. The US tended to be quite conservative in fashion. I think that has changed because of the global access in fashion and entertainment."

"The main point about Primark is its price positioning. It is not going in as just another young fashion brand. It is going in as a young fashion brand with a very defined price edge on competitors that sets it apart. But it has all the trappings of the big stores and the feel of a more expensive fashion brand. I am sure that the likes of [US rival] Forever 21 are a bit worried."

She also pointed out that Primark had not exhuasted its prospects for expansion in Europe. "Primark has got potential to become a global fashion brand. It is at the early stages, if you compare it to the likes of Inditex and H&M, but there is potential." It is also likely that Primark harbours ambitions beyond the US: "I am sure China is probably on their list," Hinton said.

Tesco The UK's biggest supermarket opened on the west coast with great fanfare in 2007. It was forced to beat a retreat five years later after running up more than £1.5bn in losses and investment costs.

M&S Offloaded US grocer King's in 2006 to focus on its ailing British business. That was the second retreat for M&S, which lost two-thirds of its investment when it sold the Brooks Brothers clothing chain in 2001.

HMV Sold its last US outlet in 2004. It had been overambitious and never made a profit from its expensive stores.

Sainsbury's Sold its US chain Shaw's as it struggled to expand and compete.

WH Smith built up a portfolio of stores in airports and hotels but sold them after the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001.

Laura Ashley Sold its entire US chain for $1 in 1999 after a string of profit warnings caused by over-ambitious expansion.
Kate Moss's Topshop collection hits shelves next week, and this exclusive video gives an insight into the creative process: think poring over moodboards, giving Uncle Phil a hug and issuing some very Mossy compliments. "Ooh, it's gorge," and, "It's quite a number," are our favourites. Also, while watching this video, we worked out who Kate Moss's voice doppelgänger is: the similarly husky actor Gemma Arterton . So that's one mystery solved
When Cara Delevingne told Vogue that one of her favourite apps was the newly released Asap54 – which uses visual-recognition technology to identify clothes – it was a PR shot in the arm for the new player in an area where competition to become the definitive technology is rife.

Snap Fashion in the UK, Style-Eyes from Ireland and Slyce in Canada are just a few of the companies that are using elaborate software to allow shoppers to take a picture of clothing on their smartphone and then be linked to a retailer where they can buy that piece or something similar.

Image-recognition software, where algorithms are used to identify and match one image with another, has been used in security and marketing for a number of years, and the move into fashion is seen as one of the first steps in the widespread commercialisation of the technology.

Jenny Griffiths started the groundwork for what would become Snap Fashion during her degree at the University of Bristol where she graduated in 2009. Launched during London fashion week in September 2012, it notched up 250,000 users in its first year.

When a picture is taken of a shoe or a piece of clothing, the software – on a desktop or mobile – analyses it by looking at the colour, pattern and shape, and tries to find a match on an existing database of products from 170 retailers ranging from New Look to Harrods. Another app called ColourPop matches products solely by colour.

"I think it is really fascinating but also someone's job to push technology into consumer spaces because we are wasting the tools [smartphones] we are carrying around every day," said Griffiths. Snap Fashion has created an app for Westfield shopping centres that lets shoppers upload a picture and then receive suggestions from the ranges in stock.

Mark Hughes, who has worked in image recognition for 10 years, is a co-founder of Dublin-based Style-Eyes, which has attracted about 65,000 users since it launched last year. Users take a picture of what they want to find, draw an outline round it and the image is matched against a database of 1.5m pieces of clothing, shoes and handbags. Suggestions of where they can buy something similar across 600 shops are shown.

"If someone matches a very expensive dress, the chances are they will not be able to afford it but what we intend to do is bring back similar ones that might be in the price range so you can filter all the results with what your intended range is – [for example] 'Find me something like that that is less than £200'," said Hughes.

Both firms make commission when items are bought via their sites – Snap Fashion makes 5-15% and Style-Eyes 5-12%. Style-Eyes says it receives up to 15 pence each time a user clicks through to a retailer. Both say just over one third of searches result in users going through to a retailer's website.

Although there are numerous players in the field, one industry commentator from a fashion retailer said no single company has managed to reach the tipping point that will make it the standard technology for consumers and brands to use. Technological glitches can happen when the various programmes cannot recognise clothing because of a lack of distinguishing features and no one yet claims a 100% success rate.

"Fashion, from a technical perspective, is very difficult for image recognition mainly because clothes change because of what way someone is sitting or what direction you are taking it [the picture]. With standard image-recognition technology now, it works really well for static objects – the front of a box of cornflakes or the front of a big building – it never really changes, the structure remains the same. That is almost a solved problem but with fashion it is a lot more difficult," said Hughes.

Griffiths does not believe a 100% success rate is possible. "Sometimes you have that experience when you Google something and you say 'actually that is not what I am looking for' and you have to try a different search term. So just the nature of search is you are not going to get it right 100% of the time. It is all about getting the user to manage it when they get the wrong result to getting them to the right one," she said.

Cortexica, a London-based firm, uses its FindSimilar software to build image-recognition facilities for retailers such as Zalando in Germany where shoppers upload images and are redirected to stock items.

Iain McCready, chief executive of Cortexica, said the rapid development of technology will enable clothes to be identified from video within two generations of iPhones. Eight computer scientists in the staff of 20 at Cortexica are constantly updating the software, which was initially developed by Imperial College London.

So far the software has largely been aimed at women's fashion – the largest part of the market –but it is expected men will soon feature. Style-Eyes hopes to expand to the US in the summer, and Cortexica is already setting up there.

Griffiths says there is not a lot of difference between various visual search companies' products and expects one to emerge as the dominant technology in the future.

"I like to think we are close to the tipping point as an industry and I like to think we are leading. I think it will be one company that does [succeed] because I don't think consumers will be bothered downloading a load of visual search apps and test them out for themselves," she said.

Style-Eyes uses a technique called "machine learning" where a computer is trained in the same way as a human. By showing the computer thousands of images of clothes, shoes and handbags, the computer distinguishes between them.

A fingerprinting system, where a digital code is created for each item using visually distinctive characteristics such as colour, shape and pattern is then used to categorise each one for search and comparison across a database of products.

Algorithms that Snap Fashion's Jenny Griffiths created at the University of Bristol to identify colour, pattern and shape are still used today although are now 100 times faster.
I now know the answer to the question that's haunted me ever since I began investigating the true cost of fast fashion. How many people would it take to be killed in the supply chain for fashionable, low-cost garments before any of us actually gave a damn? Ahead of the first anniversary of the catastrophic collapse of the Rana Plaza complex in Bangladesh, I can tell you the number must be more than 1,133. Because this is the Rana Plaza death toll and yet the biggest fast-fashion brands have had, arguably, their best year yet.

You'll remember Rana Plaza because news crews surrounded the terrible scene for a few days. Some 2,500 were also injured and many await compensation; at the last count the pot stood at just £9m, well short of the £24m needed. We heard the desperate plight of some of the cheapest workers on the planet, as they were interviewed while trapped beneath the rubble.

I promise you I'm not naive enough to think capitalist markets dish out any form of poetic justice, but I suppose I imagined there would be more pause for thought. All in all, 28 western brands were identified as using Rana Plaza, but labour rights organisations were careful not to let the wider network of brands off the hook. "Any brand could've been producing in Rana Plaza," an expert told me.

It turns out that fast-fashion brands haven't just enjoyed a lucky escape in the form of business as usual but in many cases have been rewarded by spectacular growth. The garment and textile industry, worth more than $3tn per year and producing around 80bn new garments a year – whether we need them or not – is booming – and fast fashion is booming the most.

Fast fashion is the merchandising phenomenon that has built up steam over the past 15 years and now dominates our wardrobes and high streets. It ripped up the traditional fashion calendar (the period from conceptualising a piece to delivery into store) and pulverised lead times. Famously it was Inditex-owned Zara that really broke the mould, bringing in a super-responsive timetable in the form of some 12,000 new styles each year. It is now every brand's goal to be as quick – and cheap – as Zara.

This means that outsourcing hotspots like Bangladesh – now second only to China in the "cut, make and trim" (CMT) clothes-making process – with a surplus of cheap (mainly female) labour, is now engaged in produced fashion when at best it has capacity for basic garments with longer lead times. The pressure is extraordinary and is shouldered by the most vulnerable and exploited in the chain: garment workers such as those in Rana Plaza sent back into a collapsing building to finish an urgent order.

Despite the environmental footprint (from cotton production to dyeing and spinning and finishing a single garment) and the human capital, clothes are made and sold as perishable goods. Generation Y-ers have never known anything else. It's not surprising top retailers advise their design teams that mid-priced clothing only has a lifespan of five weeks in the average wardrobe. That makes £4 T-shirts and £10 jeans disposable.

The markets love this business model, which is precisely why fast fashion is winning. Investors and analysts are appreciative of its transformation from a slightly bumbling industry two decades ago, characterised by slow growth and over capacity, to a lean fighting machine where the top brands are hyper aggressive and expanding like mad. The revenues of H&M, Inditex and Fast Retailing (owner of Uniqlo) are all expected to surge, in the months ahead but the real star is Primark. Not six months after producing at Rana Plaza on that ill-fated day, its figures were described by city analysts as "remarkable".

The coffers of fast-fashion brands do not swell by themselves, of course. In the hours after Rana Plaza, global activists were dissuaded (rightly, I still think) from a boycott of the brands associated with those kinds of factories. Boycotts are out of fashion because they hurt the very people that they are designed to help; in this case some 4 million members of the CMT army that are dependent on fast-fashion production in Bangladesh. As analyst Dr Maximilian Martin puts it in his recent report on the industry, Creating Sustainable Apparel Value Chains: "Arguments that consumers should shop less are voiced every once in a while, but evidence shows that consumption will not decelerate, absent a major war occurring." I honestly think that such is our addiction to fast fashion that many of us would put on a flak jacket and run the risk.

Weirdly, it remains heretical to suggest we should pay more for clothes or that the fast-fashion brands have a case to answer. The industry carries a number of get-out-of-jail-free cards, but one of the most effective has been the idea that these brands democratise fashion, bringing the consumer unparallelled value. We've fallen for this hook, line and sinker. Honestly, from some of the rhetoric, you'd think that some fashion retailers were running food banks not flogging millions of units of disposable clothes. Closely allied to this is the idea that they are all about development and opportunity, facilitating an industrial revolution in Bangladesh and other developing economies. And although Bangladesh has all its eggs, and GDP, in the ready-made-garment industry basket, we need to assess carefully real worker opportunities. Besides, if development really were at the heart of proceedings, the brands would act very differently.

Elements of the industry are already referring to the "Bangladesh blip", eyeing new places to produce, including Burma. But unless the business model, predicated on a form of slavery, is forced to change, there will be another Rana Plaza in the future.

But I can't give up. Rana Plaza has to stand for something. Thursday 24, the first anniversary, has been designated Fashion Revolution Day by a coalition of activists from all around the world. Consumers must take some sort of stand. The fast-fashion industry must be shown it doesn't have it all completely sewn up.

Space is so short in the immense warehouses where Kopenhagen Fur, the world's largest fur auction house, runs its business, that boxes of mink skins now fill up rooms designed for inspecting furs or sorting them into different grades and colours.

"This is the biggest auction we have ever had ever, so all of the skins normally put into boxes in the basement are piled up here instead," explains press officer Nina Brønden Jakobsen.

The sight of more than 10m mink skins crammed into a facility the size of 14 football pitches is hard to forget. The more recently arrived skins, each dried stiff and just under half a metre long, are layered in metal-grilled trolleys that tower over your head, creating a wall of tiny faces, each with a barcode stapled between the eyes. The smell, intense and musky, lingers long after you leave.

Twenty years after five models, including Naomi Campbell, told the world "I'd rather go naked than wear fur" for a Peta (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) campaign, the industry is in the final stages of an unprecedented boom. Last season was a record for the auction house, with 21m skins sold for a total $2.4bn (£1.4bn) by the time the final auction ended in September.

An advert in the Economist's 28 March edition by the International Fur Federation caused protests from anti-fur activists. But its strapline – "the simple fact is: the global fur trade is valued at more than $40bn" – underlined starkly just how little their campaigning has done to curb the industry since Peta's campaign was launched in 1994.

The main reason why it failed is clear to see in Copenhagen. Up the stairs from the inspection rooms, in the auction house's dining hall, sit hundreds of Chinese buyers, eating soy-soaked eggs, dim sum, pigs' ears and other oriental favourites. "We've had to divide the cafe into different regions of China, because they don't want to sit with each other," Brønden Jakobsen explains. "We have had to hire Chinese chefs to help us with things. They make thousands of dim sum and pigs' ears and all kinds of different specialities."

Chinese business people now represent more than half of the 600-plus buyers at the auction, some of them low-level operatives in brightly coloured track suits, others multimillionaires clad in pricey designer clothing.

According to Torben Nielsen, Kopenhagen Fur's chief executive, the Chinese fur bubble has only this season started to burst.

"In a way it was a surprise that we didn't have the big drop last year, because to me it was obvious that the whole fur market was in the middle of a bubble, and that the bubble would either increase or explode," he says.

He ticks off a long list of new shopping centres that have opened in China over the past couple of years, all selling fur, ending with Harbin, a city on the Russian border, which opened three centres this year alone, adding 1,200 shops. "If every shop needs to sell 600 coats a year, and each coat needs 35 mink skins, that's something like 50% of the total Danish production right there," he says.

Mink skins reached a record average price of $102 (£61), or $3,500 for a fur coat in September. Since then, they have plummeted to $54 as it has dawned on the Chinese buyers that they will struggle to sell on their vast storehouses full of stock.

Yang Zhenyuan, a young man whose family factory in north-east China takes in a staggering 200,000 skins a year, argues that many Chinese buyers will soon exit the market. "There are a lot of people who just entered this in the last year, and they bought the skins at quite high prices," he says. "They didn't know that the market price was going to keep going down like this, so they're already leaving the business."

For HW Kim, a buyer from South Korea inspecting a lot of brown velvet mink, this can only be a good thing. "The price is good, but the Korea market isn't so good," he says. "So we buy." He checks each skin by pulling it hard from each end with a snap, running his fingers over the fur, and then shaking it.

For now, though, Chinese buyers are still here, and Kopenhagen Fur, with its 60% global market share, continues to reap the benefits. Emile Connor, a London-based fur trader, thinks this is a shame. Only a few decades ago the fur market was centred on Garlick Hill, next to Mansion House tube station in London, the site of Beaver House, the headquarters of the Hudson's Bay Company. "Right up until the 1970s, it was the biggest auction in the world," he says. "All of the benefit could have gone to the UK." But you don't have to spend long watching the quick-fire bidding in the auction room to see the important role the British still play.

"Most of the biggest brokers here are British, and most of them still keep their stock in the UK," says Connor, who bought the most expensive lot at the peak of the market in September. At peak the auctioneers were selling £3,000-worth of fur a second, their hammers clacking down to signify a sale almost continuously.

Frank Zilberkweit, a major British buyer who owns the British fur designer Hockley, is keen to stress how little long-term impact the UK and US anti-fur campaign has had internationally. "When the anti-fur campaign was at its peak, production fell to 22 million mink worldwide," he points out. "This year it's 80 million. You can talk to Peta, you can talk to these anti-fur campaigners, but the fact is that many of their models from the 1990s are now modelling fur."

Nielsen, Kopenhagen Fur's chief executive, agrees that Britain's anti-fur farming law and the UK "public morality" which deters most people from wearing fur is "not relevant at all" for the industry. Nonetheless, like every other spokesman for the trade, he launches almost automatically into an attack on the campaigners.

"In Great Britain you're quite uncritical and you swallow everything they come up with," he says. For him, being an anti-fur campaigner is one step from fascism. "If you want to treat animals like people, then you can go the other way and treat people like animals," he argues. "And that's what they did in Nazi Germany. The first animal rights law was passed through the German parliament in 1936."

One way Britain is relevant to the fur market, he concedes, is through its fashion industry. "If it's out of fashion in Europe, it will be out of fashion in China," he says. "The fashion is still created in Europe, and if you look at Europe there's a lot of fur around."

Fashion is one of the fur industry's greatest recent successes. The likes of Dolce & Gabbana, Alexander McQueen, Prada, Louis Vuitton, Fendi and Tom Ford are all including fur in their recent collections. Yang, with his black baseball jacket, designer glasses and silver fleur-de-lis earring, knows what is fashionable in Europe. But he argues that for now fur is a status symbol in China rather than a fashion item.

"Mink is a symbol of who you are, it's a symbol of status, and that's why a lot of middle-class people are buying fur. Everybody wants to look wealthy," he says. As for young, fashionable Chinese like himself, he personally can't see them embracing it. "The young people, they aren't our target group," he says. "The Chinese are more and more well-educated today, so the awareness of animal rights and human rights is getting bigger. The way they kill minks in China is very cruel. That's why a lot of the new generation don't wear fur."
A new campaign to change the way we think about shopping will be launched on Thursday, one year after the garment trade disaster at the Rana Plaza in Bangladesh. Backed by MPs including the shadow consumer minister, Stella Creasy, and Labour's international development spokeswoman, Alison McGovern, as well as fashion-trade insiders such as Mary Portas and Caryn Franklin, the campaign was set up by Carry Somers, an ethical-trade entrepreneur. It aims to build connections throughout the fashion supply chain, linking the cotton farmer, the dyer and the seamstress with the consumer.

Surveys have shown that two-thirds of fashion firms are unclear about the full production process of the clothes they manufacture and have no plans to engage with customers' ethical concerns. Fashion Revolution Day hopes to change that by encouraging people to put pressure on stores by sending messages through social media and other means to their favourite shops, asking: "Who makes my clothes?"

As the anniversary of the disaster approaches, campaigners are increasingly angry at the failure of some of the brands which used the Rana Plaza factory to give adequate recompense to the injured and the families of victims. Some 800 children were orphaned in the tragedy, while hundreds of others were left crippled and unable to work. The UN agency in charge of the compensation scheme revealed last week that only just over a third – £9m – of the £24m target had so far been raised.

Of the 28 brands linked to the complex at Savar, on the outskirts of Dhaka, which collapsed on 24 April last year, killing 1,133 people and injuring more than 2,500, only half have paid into the fund run by the International Labour Organisation, with some giving as little as £100,000. Brands which have not paid include Matalan, Benetton and JC Penney and there are concerns that the first round of payments – £1.2m due to go to 3,000 people – may not be made before the anniversary. Primark last week increased its contribution to around £8m and Mango has also made a payment, although it will not reveal the amount.

This week, another UK event will focus on those left in poverty by Rana Plaza. Open Vizor, War on Want, Traid, and the Rainbow Collective will premiere a new documentary, Tears in the Fabric, to press more brands to pay up and sign the Bangladeshi safety accord.

Film-maker Hannan Majid, of the Rainbow Collective, has spent years documenting the garment factories with co-director Richard York. "Even before Rana Plaza, there were fires and accidents all the time," he said.

This year they returned to make Tears in the Fabric, which features Razia Begum, who is raising two grandsons, orphaned when both her daughters and her son-in-law perished at Rana Plaza, leaving the boys without financial support. She is destitute and switches from shelter to shelter each night, with eight-year-old Bijoi and six-year-old Parvez, while awaiting compensation. "When you make documentaries there are often moments that are inspirational, but with Rana Plaza it's hard to find," York said. "There is a strong sense in Savar that something terrible happened here. The whole town is traumatised. [The] workers that day didn't want to go into the building... they were forced in.

"It's important for people to realise why this money is needed, a whole generation of young people died and that left grandparents to bring up their kids. When Begum goes to visit her daughters' graves, they actually have to cross the rubble of the factory. You can still see all the ripped clothing of the workers and the labels from the clothes they were making for UK brands."

On 24 April, the film will have its charity premiere in London at Regent's University to raise money for the families.

Graciela Romero, international programmes director at War on Want, said: "It is scandalous that Rana Plaza victims, like Razia with her orphaned grandchildren, are struggling to survive, almost a year after the disaster.

"Mango has paid into the disaster trust fund, but not revealed how much, and Razia, the boys and others face dire hardship, while they wait for compensation.

"The lesson companies must learn from the disaster is they must not only sign the Bangladesh safety accord, but also ensure the victims do not suffer further, as brands drag their heels over providing redress."

Pressure from inside and outside Bangladesh has seen some limited improvements to workers' conditions. Two international agreements have seen inspections of garment factories begin in Bangladesh, with the first reports being published last month and revealing long lists of issues from blocked fire exits to overladen foundations and dangerous electrics. Owners are supposed to be getting financial support to make improvements but many have been complaining of confusion in the system and of not being able to access loans. They have also been talking of unnamed European buyers refusing to accept cost rises to cover the workers' pay increases, which came into effect in November.

The rise in the minimum wage, brought in after several days of strikes and protests by workers last year, was supposed to address some of the concerns about sweatshop labour but has been swallowed up in many cases by local rent rises, which came into effect at the same time.

However, investment in Bangladesh does not seem to have been affected by the global attention after Rana Plaza, and the Tazreen fire which preceded it.

Export earnings increased 12.88% year-on-year to $22bn in the first nine months of the fiscal year, on the back of the continued high demand for the country's clothing from Europe and the US. Garment exports between July and March rising 15.15% year-on-year to $18.05bn, according to the Export Promotion Bureau.

No one has yet been convicted over the collapse of the factory but last week the Bangladesh government seized properties belonging to the owner of Rana Plaza, Sohel Rana, a junior official in the ruling Awami League party, who was arrested days after the tragedy as he tried to flee into neighbouring India. He was one of around 40 people whom police said would be charged in connection with the disaster.

But the seizures came months after a high court ruling that they should be confiscated.

"We have confiscated all his properties, including the Rana Plaza land, a multi-storey tower at Savar and a big slice of land in the neighbouring district of Dhamrai," said deputy district administrator Fazal Mir.

Bangladesh is now the world's second-largest clothing producer after China. Stores including Walmart, Tesco and Carrefour, as well as the US military, source large amounts of their clothes from Bangladesh, home to around 4,500 garment factories and employing some 4 million workers.
For a very brief moment, just before daybreak, the narrow backstreets are empty. Trucks still rumble down the potholed road through the town but the last workers have long gone home, walking past the furled awnings of the market stalls, over the single footbridge, along the battered pavements, to the tenement apartments, the squalid huts, the tin-roofed homes by the fetid pond.

Then, as light comes, the silence is broken: water splashes into a bucket held under a standpipe by a child, a pressure cooker wails, someone laughs. In thousands of homes, tens of thousands of people are scooping rice and vegetables from tin bowls, packing the leftovers to eat during the long day ahead and then, hands rinsed, goodbyes said, filing out into the streets, the streams of workers uniting and then separating as they flow through the town, like blood through veins, each leading to a different factory. In the evening the flow will reverse, the pulse slower, less certain. But now, at 7.30am, it is sure and steady.

On this morning, 23 April last year and the day before the disaster, the workers at the five factories housed in the eight-storey Rana Plaza arrive as usual around 7.45am. There are 2,200 registered employees in the complex, plus those who staff the bank and the shops on the first floor. Once through the doors at the rear, they head up the narrow stairs to their workplaces: New Wave Bottoms on the second floor, Phantom Apparels on the third, Phantom Tac on the fourth, then Ether Tex and finally New Wave Style on the sixth and seventh floors. For several years now, these five companies have produced millions of items of clothing for western clients including Matalan and Primark.

Among the workers is Mahmuda Akhter. Her husband, Habibullah, works in the Phantom Tac factory a floor above, and as usual the couple have walked to work together, leaving their baby girl at home with Mahmuda's mother. They are from a small village in Pabna district 100 miles from Savar. Unusually for conservative Bangladesh, theirs is a "love marriage", not arranged by their parents. Mahmuda is 20; Habibullah, 23.

Mahmuda reaches her sewing machine and sits down. A few yards away is Shapla Begum, a supervisor working on another of the three lines, each of around 80 sewing machine operators, that constitute Phantom Apparels. Shapla is 27 and has been in Savar for five years. She, too, is a migrant. Her husband's earnings as a rickshaw puller in their village in Kurigram in the distant north were insufficient to pay for schooling for their two boys so, following other relatives, they came to Savar.

Working for Ether Tex on the fifth floor are Runarini and her two daughters. Runarini is a "helper", cleaning and carrying, as is the younger of the two girls, Preity, who is 15. The elder, 18-year-old Shamapati, a serious girl who laughs rarely, says little and works hard, is a sewing machine operator. The trio have arrived in Savar more recently than most of their colleagues and so can afford only a single room in a battered, tin-roofed shack. They hope that in time they will find something better. The open yard full of chickens and children in front of their new home reminds Preity of the fields and trees she left behind, and of the friends she misses.

But she likes Shonjit Das, the 19-year-old son of her immediate neighbour. He works in the finishing section of Ether Tex, packing the clothes to be sent off to the west, and is handsome and funny, and sometimes walks her home at the end of the day. And she knows the three women are earning many times what labouring in others' fields or cultivating their own poor, eroded land back in their village would ever have paid.

At 8am, as every morning except Sundays, in all the factories, on every floor of the Rana Plaza, the bell sounds, conversation ends and work starts.

No one is entirely sure how big the global clothing industry is, what profit it makes or how many it employs. It is estimated that $300bn worth of clothes were made by the top 10 producers in 2012, and the industry as a whole generates revenues of between $500m and $2tn. But no one really knows.

Textiles, if not garments, have always been a key element of global commerce. For more than a thousand years, trade between Europe and east Asia travelled what were known as the "silk routes". Later, the textile industry played an important role in Britain's emergence as the world's leading commercial power. There and elsewhere, the rag trade employed millions and created immense wealth, playing a key role in the transition of western nations from agrarian to industrial economies. But nothing really compares with what is happening today, either in scale or in impact. For as the west has got richer, its demand for clothes has steadily risen.

Garment-making is labour-intensive and there is often little room for savings on the textiles that are the biggest single cost. This means the price of a human being cutting, making and trimming a garment is key in the overall production costs and, of course, eventual profits. Through the 50s and 60s, producers hunted cheaper labour in east Asia – first Japan and then, in the 70s and 80s, in the so-called Asian Tiger economies of Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan. Employment in the garment manufacturing industry in the west has declined steadily decade on decade – despite attempts to protect local industries with quota systems and tariffs. Production in newly industrialised China, as well as in Indonesia, Turkey, Mexico and India, has increased exponentially.

For the consumer, of course, this has all meant that while prices of everything else except communications have risen, clothes cost less. In 1900, 15% of a US household's income was spent on clothing. In 1950, it was still 12%. Even as late as the early 1990s, major purchases of clothing – a suit, a dress, a coat – marked a special occasion or a rite of passage. But by 2004, the total amount spent by households on clothes had dropped to just 4%. By 2010, according to the US Bureau of Labour Statistics, clothing cost the average American family only $1,700 (£1,017), 2.8% of their income. And for that money the consumer gets much more. Cheap no longer means nasty; it just means affordable. In 1997, the average woman in the UK bought 19 items of clothing a year; in 2007, she bought 34.

The big bang in recent textile history came in a few short years at the beginning of the last decade, when various factors coincided to change radically the nature and scale of garment production around the planet. One was the end of the quota system put in place 30 years earlier to protect western industries. A second was a new degree of conformity of tastes across the world, allowing greater uniformity of product and bigger volumes of single designs. A third was "fast fashion".

Fast fashion is at once a mode of production, a strategy and a style. It grew out of the efforts of the major western brands, which dominate garment sales, to find new ways to coax further demand out of a saturated market. Though soon adopted by retailers across the world, it was pioneered by Inditex, the giant Spanish company that owns Zara. It depends on a series of mutually reinforcing innovations: an accelerated cycle of design, production and supply that means trends can be spotted, copied and sold within weeks; no "seasons", but a year-round product flow; low stock levels in stores to encourage rapid, repeated impulse purchases; a supply chain that can respond when shop staff notice that shoppers suddenly seem to like lace, or blue, or diamond patterns, or a particular stitching on their socks, or whatever; huge numbers of young adults for whom shopping is the primary leisure activity; a new obsession with celebrities, fuelled by social media and the internet; and, of course, low prices.

Sourcing has thus become a complex operation in which scores of different factors – cost, location, eventual market, risk, competition, styling, quality and so on – are computed to decide on an eventual place of production. Basic clothing – socks, for example – will be ordered in huge quantities with long lead times. Higher quality workmanship will be done in Europe, north Africa or, for the US market, Latin America. More fashion-led items are often needed in smaller quantities but faster. And cost, whatever the brands say, is always the prime consideration. So in this highly networked system, places where suppliers can turn around vast quantities of clothing very rapidly and very cheaply are key. Places where you can order, say, 500,000 basic shirts, paying $6 per piece, and they will be shipped on time, with minimum fuss, and be in stores, retailing for $30, within, at the outside, two to three months. Places such as Bangladesh.

Mahmuda and her husband are standing in a crowd of workers outside the Rana Plaza complex. They have been there for nearly 40 minutes and now 2,000 people are massed around the building. Shapla is there, too, and Preity, her mother and sister, and Shonjit, her 19-year-old friend. There is a low murmur of discontent and concern.

It is 24 April. The previous day, shortly after work started, three cracks were found in the reinforced concrete pillars that support the eight-storey building. An engineer sent by the Savar municipality declared the building unsafe, work in the five factories was halted and everyone was sent home.

Mahmuda's job is to stitch seams and pockets. It is one of the tougher of the 60 or 70 separate operations needed to make a pair of trousers. She is supposed to stitch 120 pairs an hour, 10 hours a day, six days a week, 50 weeks of the year. That's 360,000 annually. She earns 8,000BDT (£60) each month. Her husband, a quality controller, earns a little more.

Each line in Mahmuda's factory is watched over by three supervisors. Shapla is one of only a handful who are women. She is paid 10,000BDT (£75) for monitoring the 15 workers and five helpers on her section, but gets no overtime. The line's target and their progress is indicated on a board hung on the wall above the output bins where the finished clothes are dropped. The workers get an hour off for lunch. The boss "is a well-mannered person" and there are no complaints, or at least not from Shapla's section.

If an order is delivered late, accepted practice in much of the industry is for the buyer to deduct 5% for each week of delay. The buyers already have political unrest, wildcat strikes and blockades to deal with; they cannot afford to risk losing further days of production.

And that is what they are facing now.

Which may explain how, somehow, overnight, the cracks that shut the factory the day before have become less dangerous and the management has called in the workforce. The building has been inspected once more and is safe, they say. Monthly salaries are due in 10 days, but overtime, which increases most employees' salaries by between a third and a half, and means being able to pay the rent or eat properly, will be paid in the next day or so. Many of the workers are told by their managers that unless they work, they will not receive the money. What choice have we got, the workers are saying to each other. We are here to work, after all.

The managers know this. They know, too, that, as a female supervisor, Shapla is trusted more than her male counterparts, and not just by "her girls". So when they want the workers to stop shouting and calm down, and to enter the building, take their places at their machines and finish the big orders the factories are currently under pressure to complete on time, several come to her, telling her again how the building is safe, how the girls trust her, how if she doesn't go in, the girls won't either. She is uncertain, reluctant, but because at that moment it is the easiest thing to do, she gives way and goes in. And her girls follow.

Similar pressure has been put on other supervisors. They, too, reluctantly head into the building. Soon all the workers are flowing up the stairs. Mahmuda leaves her husband in the stairwell. He carries on up to his factory. She makes her way to her desk and machine on the third floor. On the fifth floor, in the Ether Tex factory, 15-year-old Preity, her mother and her sister are working by 8.30am. Preity is on her feet, moving up and down the line, clearing offcuts, bringing new needles or thread; her mother is nearby, her sister working at a sewing machine on the same line but at the opposite end of the room.

Mahmuda has time to stitch maybe two or three pieces before the lights go out, the old fans, which barely dent the heat in the factory, slow and the sewing machines stop. A power cut, frequent enough and no cause for alarm. The workers wait in the gloom, talking quietly, worried, waiting for the powerful, heavy generators installed on the roof to start up.

Moments after the generators start, sending vibrations through the building, a pillar in one corner of the Rana Plaza gives way with a loud, explosive bang. Then each storey slides sideways, tips and splits, falling in on the one below. On the third floor, the collapse is almost instantaneous, but the workers of Phantom Apparels still have time to realise what is happening.

The floor starts shaking and it is clear the building is coming down. Mahmuda starts reciting verses of the Qur'an. She staggers, falls and crawls beneath her sewing machine.

Shapla is walking down her line when the building starts to collapse. She starts running. She, too, seeks protection under a sewing machine and then everything gives way around her. She is in darkness, gasping for breath.

Two floors above, the floor inclines slowly like the deck of a sinking ship. Panicked workers rush to the two narrow exits. It is dark, there is much dust and noise. Runarini has managed to find her youngest daughter, Preity, and is now trying to get to the other end of her line where Shamapati, her eldest, was working at her machine. But the force of bodies pushes her towards the exit. She cannot hold on to Preity and fight the crowd to find Shamapati. The floor lurches, tips again and everything falls.

In the darkness after the collapse there are many voices: sobs, sustained screaming, calls for help and water, moans of pain, prayers, howls of grief. Some are trapped in total darkness, others can make out some light. Many are pinned down by huge blocks of concrete, bent iron girders, machinery. Others are entombed in small cavities. Some are alone, others with colleagues or strangers from other floors. Shapla can move her hand but nothing else. Mahmuda can see the sky through a gap in the wall several yards away. Runarini and Preity are trapped together and they can hear voices, but not Shamapati's. They shout her name, but there is no response.

Outside there is chaos. Dazed survivors stand immobile in a huge, roiling cloud of dust. It takes time for Dhaka's ramshackle emergency services to arrive, so hundreds of locals clamber over and through the rubble, tearing at the concrete blocks and mangled metal with their hands. Soon corpses are lined up on the ground, limbs limp and twisted, as if they had fallen from a great height. Mahmuda crawls towards the light, finds herself only a few metres from the ground and clambers down. She cannot see her husband.

Shapla waits longer for rescue. She can hear sirens and shouts outside. They are hammering and drilling the slab of concrete above her. She finds her throat so dry from screaming that she cannot talk when the rescuers find her. She is unaware that she has made any noise whatsoever. It takes two hours to free her.

Runarini and Preity crawl together towards a shaft of light and are lifted from the rubble by mid-afternoon. The ruined building is now surrounded by police and soldiers, and heavy lifting equipment is arriving. There are electric saws and jackhammers, and lines of ambulances. There is no sign of Shamapati.

Bangladesh is the original "basket case", a term coined by Henry Kissinger, the US secretary of state, to describe the country immediately after its violent secession from Pakistan in 1971. Up to 3 million died in that conflict, a civil war that was simultaneously a war of independence, and its wounds remain livid. Famine, flood, a massive programme of nationalisation, political instability and further violence crippled the new nation's economy. But, despite the continual challenges, the textiles and garment industry prospered. Investment and advice from Korean companies helped and, by the end of the 1990s, the industry had somehow weathered destructive storms – political, economic and meteorological.

In 2004, when the protectionist quotas that had been imposed to protect western jobs 30 years earlier expired, many in Bangladesh were apprehensive. But the industry boomed. "Business just took off," says Rubana Huq, now managing director of garment manufacturers the Mohammadi Group. In 2004 there were 2 million workers in Bangladesh's 4,000 factories, with exports worth $6bn. Nine years later, there were twice as many in 5,600 registered establishments, sending $21bn worth of clothes overseas.

Competition from abroad when the quotas disappeared meant "prices dipped", Huq says, but the demand from Europe and the US was so great that she and others "just kept on building". If wages in Bangladesh remained the lowest in the world, land prices in central Dhaka, where most of the garment businesses were based, rose so fast that new investors sought space on the margins of the city where hastily reclaimed wetlands could still be bought relatively cheaply. In Savar, Gazipur, Ashulia and elsewhere around Dhaka, hundreds of factories went up every year. There was little or no planning or regulation.

"People were not much concerned by building codes or quality of material," admits Emdadul Islam, the long-serving chief engineer of Rajuk, Dhaka's development authority. Monitoring of environmental impact, construction quality and permits for the millions flowing in from rural areas were almost nonexistent.

Inevitably, people started to die. In April 2005, a factory in Savar called Spectrum collapsed, killing 64 workers. The dead were making clothes for western retailers. Poor cement was a likely cause – builders often charge for better-quality materials than they deliver – or water from a nearby canal may have washed out foundations. For a short period there was talk of a crackdown on unsafe buildings, but even though a second factory in northern Dhaka collapsed a year later, killing 21, the fuss faded. As the recession hit western economies in 2008 and 2009, brands forced down prices even further as they negotiated with suppliers. Those in Bangladesh who demanded government intervention in one of the country's few economic success stories made little headway when dozens of garment factory owners sat in parliament and powerful industry bodies had the ear of policymakers. The boom continued. Bangladesh, the world's 76th biggest exporter of clothes in 1980, was the eighth biggest in 2006, and by 2013 was second only to China.

Over the decade, prompted by a string of reports of child labour and other abuses in factories around the world, the brands had set up systems to monitor pay and working conditions in their supply chain. Some organised their own inspections, many brought in contractors. But executives did not think to undertake structural surveys of the buildings where their clothes were made. Instead, they relied on the corrupt, poorly paid, underqualified, undermanned local authorities. This, senior executives at major European brands now admit, was a mistake. Others use stronger terms. From 2005 to March 2013, fires killed an estimated 600, but no more buildings collapsed.

The Dhaka suburb of Gulshan is only 15 miles from Savar. Rickshaws negotiate its quiet, tree-lined streets with relative ease and there are many good restaurants. In the late morning, coffee shops are busy with staff from international NGOs and the UN. This is where the Bangladesh operations of many big European and US brands are based, as are the larger buyers who often act as their intermediaries locally.

The offices of H&M occupy a new five-storey block. There is nothing to distinguish the building, inside or out, from its counterparts in any western capital. On the walls of brightly lit meeting rooms – each named after garment manufacturing zones around the city – are posters of laughing, thin, beautiful young Europeans of varying ethnic backgrounds wearing the bright, cheery, fashionable clothes of the company's brands. A notice tells staff: "Your passionate focus towards quality will make it happen."

H&M, which has 3,000 stores in around 50 markets worldwide and sales of £13bn in 2012 (making a profit of £1.6bn), has been in Bangladesh since the early 80s and is one of the biggest foreign brands working in the country. The Swedish retailer did not have any contracts with the factories working in Rana Plaza, nor any link to the building, and has long been at the forefront of efforts to find a way to improve pay and working conditions in the industry. These have intensified since last April's tragedy, but "there's a lot more to the country for us than low wages and low costs", says Anna Gedda, the company's social sustainability manager.

Executives from other big brands all make similar points when talking about the Rana Plaza collapse, even if their companies have been less proactive than H&M. They express their shock and grief, say they have long recognised the problems in Bangladesh, point out that the chaotic environment of a developing world city means many issues are partly beyond their control (though, they admit, still their responsibility), and downplay the significance of cheap labour in the decision to locate production in the country. They also emphasise the importance of the garment industry to the Bangladeshi economy and the social transformation brought about by the employment of millions of young, rural women, albeit in poorly paid, monotonous jobs. One company spokesman points out that otherwise "these women would be in the fields, in ship-breaking or shrimp farming, working as maids". Now, he says, they are breadwinners, independent, and often with the means to pay for their kids to go to school.

H&M's Gedda says: "The best way for the country is for brands like H&M to stay there." This is something one hears frequently: from the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, senior ministers, international trade unionists, independent economists and urban development specialists in Dhaka. It's also what all the workers say. Everyone agrees that the Rana Plaza collapse was a "wake-up call" that will be "a turning point", but they all say the industry and the brands must remain. "If there is a pull-out, it will be a catastrophe for Dhaka," says Professor Nazrul Islam, of the local Centre for Urban Studies.

The result, after a series of fairly acrimonious meetings in Geneva and Paris last year, is three separate initiatives: the Accord, which involves more than 150 largely European brands; the Alliance, set up by US brands; and a joint effort by the UN and the Bangladeshi government. Between them, these three are meant to bring all the factories in Bangladesh into a system of auditing and inspection that will enforce agreed standards. They will also, theoretically, ensure structural surveys. The brands will help pay for improvements needed by their suppliers to meet the new standards – through grants in the case of the legally binding Accord and soft loans for the less constraining Alliance – and there are also provisions for strengthening the country's underdeveloped and highly politicised unions. There is a separate process designed to establish how much compensation will be paid – the total could be more than $40m – to the Rana Plaza victims. Many brands have refused to become involved and international trade unionists admit the current initiatives have many flaws. Nonetheless, they say, taken together the package represents "an unprecedented chance to put all this right".

Some specialists even hope that initiatives will provide a model not just in Bangladesh but in Cambodia, Indonesia, Latin America and even the emerging new markets for production such as Burma and Ethiopia. The risk, of course, is that attention will fade, as it did after the 2005 Spectrum factory collapse. "This is Plan B," says Srinivas Reddy, the Bangladesh country director of the International Labour Organisation. Plan A led to Rana Plaza. There is no Plan C.

If, from afar, the world of the garment workers and the garment industry in Bangladesh is one of stark contrasts, up close it is one of shadows and ambiguity. Mohammadpur, for example, is a designated slum that is also a booming new neighbourhood on the western margins of a city that has no legal boundaries. A few decades ago it was wetland like Savar or Gazipur. By the 90s, the marshes had been replaced by rows of wooden sheds on stilts full of half-starved labourers and their families. Now it is changing again as Dhaka, a city of at least 15 million, gets steadily less poor. The wooden shacks have been replaced by cement apartments and rooms. There are tea stalls with TVs tuned to the Discovery Channel, schools, shops and a refurbished mosque. "It's better than where I came from… At least there's a chance of making a living here, of a better life, perhaps," says Salahuddin, a 27-year-old labourer who fled poverty, debt and failing yields on a tiny parcel of land to bring his family to the city.

But if it is possible to see incremental and uneven progress in Dhaka, there is also misery, overcrowding, disease, crime and failing infrastructure. Police rarely venture into Mohammadpur. A fire in a garment factory here killed seven in 2013 and fear of such accidents is one reason Salahuddin's wife, Juleika, prefers poorly paid work as a maid. The dirt roads are strewn with rubbish. Water from standpipes is sold at extortionate prices by landlords in league with local politicians and bureaucrats. There is the perpetual risk of eviction and demolition. In the brutal summer heat, the concrete boxes where entire families live are furnaces.

Then there is Bangladesh. It is one of the "Next 11" nations seen by Goldman Sachs as having the potential to take off as major economies. Its development indicators have risen steadily, to the point where most are now better than those in neighbouring India. But again, if the rate of population growth has dropped in recent years, it is still high. Flooding and extreme weather events linked to climate change threaten disasters in the future in this low-lying land. The flow from the countryside to the cities is unlikely to slow soon, and, as the effluent from the factories contaminates the once pristine waterways, so toxic politics and endemic graft poison public life.

And what of the garment industry's role in all of this? Along with remittances from workers overseas, the industry is the only major foreign currency earner for the country. Wages for workers have risen since the disaster – the minimum monthly salary for an entry-level worker is now 5,300BDT (about £40) a month – but so have rents, and no one can pretend a family can live on a single salary. Factory conditions might have improved in the last decade, but even without the 1,130 who died in Rana Plaza, the toll from fires and other accidents would be intolerable. Along with the 4 million directly employed by the industry, economists say there are another 4 million people whose livelihoods depend on the internal demand it generates. If half of these 8 million people support a family of five, then around a sixth of the population depends on people several thousands miles away buying cheap clothes that they don't need.

And that means this world of ambiguity is one the consumer inhabits, too. Many debate where the blame lies for tragedies such as Rana Plaza, and argue over who has the responsibility to prevent them in the future. The owners of the factories? Those who let the buildings that house the workshops? The crooked builders? The bent bureaucrats? The government? The intermediaries who do so much of the buying? The brands?

Some western brands implicitly accept a degree of moral responsibility, even if their lawyers are careful to make sure their legal liability is strictly limited. "People portray companies as evil by definition, and in many aspects they are. But often times a company is forced to behave in certain ways by consumer behaviour. If no one buys your product, you are out of business. Consumers take decisions for companies, but often [they] don't, which means they don't care," says one senior executive at a big European high street brand.

Though there is little statistical evidence of any direct correlation between bad publicity about social issues and sales – it would, experts say, be almost impossible to establish such a link anyway – big companies do their own research to understand the impact on sales of events such as the Rana Plaza collapse.

"Companies do very precise work on this to understand the consumers and what level of quality they are willing to pay for, and [it shows that] a large number of consumers prefer inexpensive over respect for human rights or environment," the executive says. "After all, if you buy a pair of jeans at $9.99, what are you really expecting about the working conditions of those who made them or even just the environment in which they live?"

Mahmuda eventually found her husband's body, intact but for a broken nose, laid out in the makeshift morgue set up in the grounds of a local school. It took some days for her to realise that her husband was not going to walk through the door of their small home in Savar. She returned to her village to bury him, but life was as hard there as it had ever been and she was soon back in Savar. Eight months later, Mahmuda started work at another garment factory, less than 300m from where the Rana Plaza complex stood. She passes the site of the collapse – the rubble scraped away, a trough of filthy water, scattered bolts of filthy cloth, a stench of decayed matter – every day. "I tell myself if one building has collapsed, it doesn't mean they all will," she says. "I can't be scared. If I am scared, how will I feed my family? I tell myself if one building has collapsed, it doesn't mean they all will."
